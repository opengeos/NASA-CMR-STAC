    "description": "The Africa Number of Wet Days per year and Wind Velocity data sets are part of the UNEP/FAO/ESRI Database project that covers the entire world but focused on Africa in this case. The maps were prepared by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), USA. Most data for the database were provided by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Soil Resources, Management and Conservation Service Land and Water Development Division, Italy. This data set was developed in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Kenya.  The base maps used were hand drawn climate maps from FAO. All sources were re-registered to the FAO Soil Map of the world (1984) in Miller Oblated Stereographic projection by comparing known features on the basemap and the source maps. The digitizing was done with a spatial resolution of 0.002 inches.  The maps were then transformed from inch coordinates to latitude/ longitude degrees. The transformation was done by an unpublished algorithm (by US Geological Survey and ESRI) to create coverages for one-degree graticules.\n\nReferences:\nESRI.
