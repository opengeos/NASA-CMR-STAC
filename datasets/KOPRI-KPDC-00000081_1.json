    "description": "In order to investigate the structure of phytoplankton communities, physical environmental factors and chlorophyll a, this study was carried out at 10 stations on surface from May 23th to June 3rd, 2005 in the Okhotsk Sea.\r\nThe highest water temperature was 2.8\u2103 at station 2 and the lowest water temperature was 0.9\u2103 at station 5. The mean salinity was 33.34 psu. Water temperature and salinity were influenced by sea ice. The highest total Chl a concentration(2.522 Chl a \u338d \u2113-1) was appeared at station 10, the lowest concentration was appeared 0.484 Chl a \u338d \u2113-1 at station 2. Phytoplankton dominant species were nano-picophytoplankton. Phytoplankton communities were composed of 25 taxa representing diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophyceae, prasinophyceae, prymnesiophyceae in surface The most abundant species was picophytoplankton in all station except station 10, but the second was variable\nTo investigate on biodiversity, species composition, abundance and dominant species of phytoplankton communities in Okhotsk Sea",
