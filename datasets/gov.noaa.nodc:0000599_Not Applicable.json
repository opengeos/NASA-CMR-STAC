    "description": "This accession contains a GIS database of Aids to Navigation in the Gulf of Mexico and coastal waters of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. These data were compiled on 1999-10-21.\n\nThe term \"Aids to Navigation\" (ATONS or AIDS) refers to a device outside of a vessel used to assist mariners in determining their position or safe course, or to warn them of obstructions. AIDS to navigation include lighthouses, lights, buoy, sound signals, landmarks, racons, radio beacons, LORAN, and omega. These include AIDS which are installed and maintained by the Coast Guard as well as privately installed and maintained aids (permit required). This does not include unofficial AIDS (illegal) such as stakes, PVC pipes, and such placed without permission.\n\nEach USCG District Headquarters is responsible for updating their database on an \"as needed\" basis. When existing AIDS are destroyed or relocated and new AIDS are installed the database is updated. Each AID is assigned an official \"light listing number\". The light list is a document listing the current status of ATONS and it is published and distributed on a regular basis. Interim changes to the light list are published in local Notices to Mariners which are the official means which navigators are supposed to keep their charts current. In addition, the USCG broadcasts Notices to Mariners on the marine band radio as soon as changes of the status of individual AIDS are reported.\n\nThe light list number and local Notices to Mariners reports are suggested ways to keep the database current on a regular or even \"real time\" basis. However, annual (or more frequent) updates of the entire dataset may be obtained from each USCG District Headquarters.\n\nGeographic Information System (GIS) software is required to display the data in this NCEI accession.",
