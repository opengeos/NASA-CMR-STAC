    "description": "The purpose of these files is to illustrate the geologic boundary of\nthe play as defined for the 1995 U.S. National Assessment. The play\nwas used as the fundamental assessment unit.\n\nThe fundamental geologic unit used in the 1995 National Oil and Gas\nAssessment was the play, which is defined as a set of known or\npostulated oil and or gas accumulations sharing similar geologic,\ngeographic, and temporal properties, such as source rock, migration\npathways, timing, trapping mechanism, and hydrocarbon type. The\ngeographic limit of each play was defined and mapped by the geologist\nresponsible for each province. The play boundaries were defined\ngeologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the\nplay, such as the limits of the reservoir rock, geologic structures,\nsource rock, and seal lithologies. The only exceptions to this are\nplays that border the Federal-State water boundary. In these cases,\nthe Federal-State water boundary forms part of the play boundary.  The\nplay boundaries were defined in the period 1993-1994.\n\nConventional oil and gas plays within province 2 (Central Alaska) are\nlisted here by play number and name:\n\n    Number  Name\n     201   Central Alaska Cenozoic Gas\n     202   Central Alaska Mesozoic Gas\n     203   Central Alaska Paleozoic Oil\n     204   Kandik Pre-Mid-Cretaceous Strata\n     205   Kandik Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary Non-Marine Stata",
