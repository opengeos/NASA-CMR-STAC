    "description": "Initial work during the 2001/2002 field season commenced with reconnaissance and sampling in northeast Palmer Land.  Over a two month period, outcrop from the Welch Mountains to the Eternity Range was visited, the geology described, and mafic dyke samples collected for analysis.  This was followed by a further two months based on the ship HMS Endurance, carrying out helicopter assisted sampling of numerous islands and coastal localities along the western and eastern margin of northern Graham Land. Approximately 200 (400kg of dyke and host rock at Palmer land and 80kg at nine localities in Graham Land) rock samples were collected.",
