    "description": "The NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments ([MEaSUREs](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/competitive-programs/measures)) Combined Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Emissivity for Land (CAMEL) dataset provides monthly emissivity at 0.05 degree (~5 kilometer) resolution (CAM5K30EM). The CAM5K30EM data product was created by combining the University of Wisconsin-Madison MODIS Baseline Fit (UWBF) emissivity database and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset Version 4 (GED V4). The two datasets have been integrated to capitalize on the unique strengths of each product's characteristics.\n\nThe integration steps include adjustment of ASTER GED Version 3 emissivities for vegetation and snow cover variations to produce ASTER GED Version 4, aggregation of ASTER GED Version 4 emissivities from 100 meter resolution to the UWBF 5 kilometer resolution, merging of the five ASTER spectral emissivities with the UWBF emissivity to create CAMEL at 13 hinge points, and extension of the 13 hinge points to high spectral resolution (HSR) utilizing the Principal Component (PC) regression method. Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the User Guide and Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\n\nProvided in the CAM5K30EM product are layers for the CAMEL emissivity, ASTER Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), snow fraction derived from MODIS (MOD10), latitude, longitude, CAMEL quality, ASTER quality, and the UWBF emissivity quality information.\n\nKnown Issues\n* The following granules are missing from the product: January, February, and August of 2000; June and July of 2001; March of 2002; December of 2003; July of 2010; and February of 2016.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Version\n* Version 3 includes new MODIS Terra and Aqua Land Surface Temperature and 3-Band Emissivity (MYD/MOD21) input data in the University of Wisconsin-Madison  MODIS Baseline Fit (UWBF) emissivity database and the latest 6.1 version of MODIS Terra and Aqua Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (MYD/MOD11) and MYD/MOD21 products with the most up-to-date calibration corrections. Additional information on the Version 3 updates is provided in Section 2 of the User Guide and ATBD.",
