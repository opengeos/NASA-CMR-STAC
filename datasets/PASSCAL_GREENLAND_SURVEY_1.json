    "description": "The 1989 seismic survey was part of a large cooperative project\nmounted in Greenland to carry out geophysical studies of the Earth's\noldest crust. The targets included possible oceanic crust under the\noldest supracrustal rocks, granulite terrains and three crustal\nsutures. Geophysical studies consisted of gravity, CDP reflection and\nwide-angle reflection studies that combine recording on land and at\nsea using a 6000 cu. in. airgun array from the University of Bergen's\nresearch vessel shooting every 100 meters.\n\n   A total of 35 stations recorded various portions of the\nshooting. There were two lines perpendicular to the coast along fjords\nand two lines parallel to the coast. A total of 400 Mbytes of data\nwere recorded.",
