    "description": "The Australian Antarctic Data Centre's Macquarie Island Station GIS Dataset was originally produced from low level aerial photography of the station and from ground surveys. Refer to the metadata record 'Macquarie Island Station GIS Dataset'.\n\nSince then various features have been added to this data as structures have been removed, moved or established. Some of these features have been surveyed.\nThese surveys have metadata records from which the report describing the survey can be downloaded.\nHowever, the locations of other features have been obtained from a variety of sources.\nThe data are included in the data available for download from a Related URL below.\nThe data conform to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See a Related URL below.\nData described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 31.\nEach feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets and quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature.",
