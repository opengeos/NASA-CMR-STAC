    "description": "Soil cores were collected from numerous locations across the Macquarie Island Isthmus. Replicate samples were collected from each location and a single sample was collected from 50cm depth below the surface. Soil cores were cylindrical, diameter 70 mm, depth 70 mm and included surface vegetation where present. Invertebrates were extracted from the soil core using a heat gradient process. Specimens were preserved in ethanol following extraction.\nInvertebrates were identified under microscope to the lowest practicable level, which was species level for most taxa. Mites (Acarina) were identified to morphotype.\n\n\nColumn labels\nSample - Unique numerical sample identifier\nDepth - Depth of collection: surface = 0 cm, depth = 50 cm below surface\nLocation - Location identifier code\nEasting - easting (m)\nNorthing - northing (m)\nElevation (m) - Height above sea level (m)\nParisotoma insularis - Abundance of Parisotoma insularis in core sample\nFolsotoma punctata - Abundance of Folsotoma punctata in core sample\nTullbergia bisetosa - Abundance of Tullbergia bisetosa in core sample\nCeratophysella denticulata - Abundance of Ceratophysella denticulata in core sample\nHypogastrura viatica - Abundance of Hypogastrura viatica in core sample\nHypogastrura purpurescens - Abundance of Hypogastrura purpurescens in core sample\nCryptopygus antarcticus - Abundance of Cryptopygus antarcticus in core sample\nCryptopygus caecus - Abundance of Cryptopygus caecus in core sample\nCryptopygus lawrencii - Abundance of Cryptopygus lawrencii in core sample\nCryptopygus tricuspus - Abundance of Cryptopygus tricuspus in core sample\nPolykatianna davidii - Abundance of Polykatianna davidii in core sample\nLepidocyrtus sp. - Abundance of Lepidocyrtus sp. in core sample\nMegalothorax sp. - Abundance of Megalothorax sp. in core sample\nAcarina 1 - Abundance of Acarina 1 in core sample\nAcarina 2 - Abundance of Acarina 2 in core sample\nAcarina 3 - Abundance of Acarina 3 in core sample\nAcarina 4 - Abundance of Acarina 4 in core sample\nAcarina 5 - Abundance of Acarina 5 in core sample\nAcarina 6 - Abundance of Acarina 6 in core sample\nAcarina 7 - Abundance of Acarina 7 in core sample\nAcarina 8 - Abundance of Acarina 8 in core sample\nBig dark tick - Abundance of Big dark tick in core sample\nSpider - Abundance of Spider in core sample\nMicroscolex macquariensis - Abundance of Microscolex macquariensis in core sample\nEnchytraeus albidus - Abundance of Enchytraeus albidus in core sample\nNematode species - Abundance of Nematode species in core sample\nStyloniscus otakensis - Abundance of Styloniscus otakensis in core sample\nHarpacticoid - Abundance of Harpacticoid in core sample\nPuhuruhuru patersoni - Abundance of Puhuruhuru patersoni in core sample\nStenomalium sp. - Abundance of Stenomalium sp. in core sample\nThinophilus (fly) - Abundance of Thinophilus (fly) in core sample\nAustralimyza - Abundance of Australimyza in core sample\nGrasshopper? - Abundance of Grasshopper? in core sample\nSlug sp. - Abundance of Slug sp. in core sample\n\nThe easting, northing and elevation for each sample site was collected by Lauren Wise of the AAD and Josie van Dorst of the University of NSW using a Trimble differential GPS and the post processing was done by Dan Wilkins of the AAD. The elevations were derived using the global geoid model EGM96. \nTo convert the eastings and northings of the sample sites to eastings and northings on the WGS84 datum of the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's GIS data representing the Macquarie Island station buildings and structures, add 1.40 metres to the eastings and 0.2 metres to the northings as given on page 3 of the survey report \"Macquarie Island OSG Survey Campaign, Voyage 8 Round Trip, March 2002\" by John VanderNiet and Nick Bowden of the Office of the Surveyor General, Tasmania.",
