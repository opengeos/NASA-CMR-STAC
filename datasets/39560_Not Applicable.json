    "description": "The NOAA/ NASA AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder sea surface temperature data are derived from the 5-channel Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) on board the NOAA -7, -9, -11, -14, -16 and -17 polar orbiting satellites. Daily, 8-day and monthly averaged data for both the ascending pass (daytime) and descending pass (nighttime) are available on equal-angle grids of 8192 pixels/360 degrees (nominally referred to as the 4km resolution, 4096 pixels/360 degrees (nominally referred to as the 9km resolution), 2048 pixels/360 degrees (nominally referred to as the 18km resolution), and 720 pixels/360 degrees (nominally referred to as the 54km resolution or 0.5 degree resolution).The monthly averaged daytime data was converted to an ESRI GRID format and the 12 monthly grid files were combined into one annual grid with a attribute field for each month.",
