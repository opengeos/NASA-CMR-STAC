    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the Minerals Management\nService (MMS) conducted multibeam mapping in the eastern Santa Barbara Channel\nand northeastern Channel Islands region from August 8 to15, 2004 aboard the R/V\nMaurice Ewing. The survey was directed and funded by the Minerals Management\nService, which is interested in maps of hard bottom habitats, particularly\nnatural outcrops, that support reef communities in areas affected by oil and\ngas activity. The maps are also useful to biologists studying fish that use the\nplatforms and the sea floor beneath them as habitat.\n\nThe survey collected bathymetry and corrected, co-registered acoustic\nbackscatter using a Kongsberg Simrad EM1002 multibeam echosounder that was\nmounted on the hull of the R/V Maurice Ewing. Three main regions were mapped\nduring the survey including: (1) the Eastern Santa Barbara Channel adjacent to\nan area previously mapped with multibeam-sonar by the Monterey Bay Aquarium\nResearch Institute (see the MBARI Santa Barbara Basin Multibeam Survey web\npage), (2) the Footprint area south of Anacapa Island, which has been studied\nextensively by rockfish biologists and is considered a good site for a marine\nprotected area, and (3) part of the submarine canyons along the continental\nslope south of Port Hueneme. These data will be used to support a number of new\nand ongoing projects including, habitat mapping, shelf and slope processes, and\noffshore hazards and resources.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
