    "description": "Understanding the circulation of water in Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays is of\ncritical importance for determining how nutrients, sediment, contaminants and\nother water-borne materials are transported. Numerical circulation models\nrepresent a powerful tool to build understanding of transport processes in\nthese bays, as well as for synthesis, scenario testing and prediction. The U.S.\nGeological Survey has developed a three-dimensional model of circulation in\nMassachusetts Bay driven by tides, wind, river runoff, surface heating and\ncooling and remote forcing from the Gulf of Maine. The circulation calculated\nfrom this model was used as input to the HydroQual water quality model.\n\nThe USGS is currently using the model in a Regional Marine Research Program in\nthe Gulf of Maine funded study of sources, transport and nutrient environment\nof red tide populations in the western gulf. Together with investigators from\nWHOI and UNH, this work seeks to characterize the physical transport mechanisms\nthat influence the distribution and fate of toxic Alexandrium cells in this\nregion, and the processes by which cells are transported to Massachusetts Bay.\nThe ability of the regional model to represent the movement of fresh water from\nthe Kennebec and Androscoggin rivers will be determined.\n\nOver the next three years, the USGS will be developing a regional sediment\ntransport model by interfacing existing surface wave, bottom boundary layer and\nsediment erosion models into the current hydrodynamic model. Current and\nsuspended sediment data from the long-term mooring (as well as other sites)\nwill be used for calibration and verification.\n\nWhen the new outfall comes online, additional hydrodynamic model runs in\nMassachusetts Bay will be performed to test the ability of the model to\nsimulate the effects of the relocated effluent discharge.",
