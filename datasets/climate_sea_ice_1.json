    "description": "This dataset contains the digitisation of one U.S. Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Facility sea ice extent and concentration map monthly to give the latitude and longitude of the northern extent of the Antarctic sea ice.  Maps were produced weekly, but have been digitised monthly, since distribution began in January 1973 (except August 1985), until December 1996.  Maps were digitised at each 10 degrees of longitude, and the longitude, distance from the south pole to the northern edge of the sea ice at that longitude, and latitude of that edge is given, as well as the mean distance and latitude for that map. Summary tabulations (sea ice northern extent latitudes at each 10 degree of longitude each year, grouped by month) and mean monthly sea ice extent statistics are also available.",
