    "description": "The CH4_GOS_SRPR dataset is comprised of Level 2, column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (mixing ratios) of methane (XCH4). It has been produced using data acquired from the Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for Carbon Observations (TANSO-FTS) NIR and SWIR spectra, onboard the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), using the RemoTeC SRPR Proxy Retrieval algorithm.   It has been generated as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Greenhouse Gases Climate Change Initiative (GHG_cci) project.  This version of the data is version 2.3.8, and forms part of the Climate Research Data Package 4. This Proxy Retrieval product has been generated using the RemoTeC SRPR algorithm, which is being jointly developed at SRON and KIT. This has been designated as an 'alternative' GHG CCI algorithm, and a separate product has also been generated by applying the baseline GHG CCI proxy algorithm (the University of Leicester OCPR algorithm). It is advised that users who aren't sure whether to use the baseline or alternative product use the OCPR product generated with the baseline algorithm. For more information regarding the differences between the baseline and alternative algorithms please see the GHG-CCI data products webpage. The data product is stored per day in a single NetCDF file. Retrieval results are provided for the individual GOSAT spatial footprints, no averaging having been applied. As well as containing the key product, the product file contains information relevant for the use of the data, such as the vertical layering and averaging kernels. The parameters which are retrieved simultaneously with XCH4 are also included (e.g. surface albedo), in addition to retrieval diagnostics like quality of the fit and retrieval errors. For further details on the product, including the RemoTeC algorithm and the TANSO-FTS instrument, please see the associated product user guide (PUG) or the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents.",
