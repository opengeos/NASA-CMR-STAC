    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is coordinating the aquisition of high accuracy elevation data.  Three formats of the data are available for each data set: .cor files which contain complete lists of Global Positioning System point files, .asc files which are the same as the .cor files but have been reformatted to process into ARC/INFO coverages, and .e00 files which are the ARC/INFO coverages.  The files are available in the same 7.5- by 7.5-minute coverages as USGS quadrangles.  The elevation data is collected on a 400 by 400 meter grid.  The elevations are referenced to the horizontal North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) and vertical North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).\n      \n      This project is performing regional topographic surveys to collect and provide elevation data to parameterize hydrologic and ecological numerical simulation models that are being developed for ecosystem restoration activities. Surveying services are also being rendered to provide vertical reference points for numerous water level gauges.\n      \n      Modeling of sheet flow and water surface levels in the wetlands of South Florida is very sensitive to changes in elevation due to the expansive and extremely low relief terrain. Hydrologists have determined minimum vertical accuracy requirements for the elevation data for use as input to hydrologic models. As a result, elevation data with a vertical accuracy specification of +/-15 centimeters (cm) relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) are being collected in critical areas using state-of-the-art differential global positioning system (GPS) technology and data processing techniques.",
