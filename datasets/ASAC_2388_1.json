    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 2388\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nThe HIMI Ecosystem Project is aimed at examining key predators based on Heard Island, including albatross, penguins and seals, and their interactions with prey, the ocean and benthic environment and commercial fisheries. Work will include examining the diet of the animals, tracking them to determine where they feed, and examining prey available in the feeding areas. Scientists from a variety of backgrounds including bird and mammal biologists, marine biologists, oceanographers and marine geologists will be involved.\n\nThese data were collected on Aurora Australis voyage 4 2004 ('HIPPIES'). The data are stored in a Microsoft Access 97 file. The data includes sampling information for trawls using an IYGPT (International Young Gadoid Pelagic Trawl) Net and RMT 8 (8 square meter Rectangular Midwater Trawl) Nets. Sampling data, including location and time, are stored in the 'Hauls' table. Data from the analysis of the contents of each trawl, including species identifications, mass and counts of each taxon of mesopelagic fish and zooplankton are stored in the 'Bycatch' table. Weights, lengths and other biological data collected from individual mesopelagic fish are stored in the 'Fish Data' table. On opening the file the Haul form launches automatically giving access to the data.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nLatitude\nLongitude\nSpecies\nDate\nHaul Number\nTime\nDepth (m)\nTow distance\nWire out\nTow Speed (knots)\nHeadline height (m)\nHeadline width (m)\nGear\nComments\nFishing Ground\nFishery\nTraps\nLine\nHooks\nMagazines\nFish length\nOtoliths\nScale sample\nFish Weight\nStomach\nGonads\nStomach contents",
