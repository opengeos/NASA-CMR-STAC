    "description": "This dataset contains the characteristics of sporadic meteor detections at 55MHz above Davis, Antarctica and the wind speed and direction in the middle atmosphere derived from those detections. \n\nThe capability to make these measurements is an add-on to the Davis 55MHz MST radar which is used when experiment schedules allow. As such, the duration of operation in this mode has varied through the life of the instrument. \n\nThe Davis 55 MHz atmospheric radar can be run in a meteor detection mode by selecting an alternate set of transmitting and receiving antennas. These consist of a single circularly polarized transmitting antenna and five linear polarized receiving antennas arranged in a \u2018Mills Cross\u2019 configuration. \n\nIn meteor mode, circularly polarized pulses are transmitted at a high repetition rate and the received signal is sampled at ranges sensitive to returns from the altitude range of 80-110 km approximately. If a meteor trail is present in the antenna field of view, increases of power of duration less than are second can be detected. The range is calculated from the pulse transit time and the direction of arrival is inferred from the relative phases of the signals at each receive antenna. Data files with a \u2018.met\u2019 extension contain the analysed data products from these detections and these include:\nEvent start time \u2013 The time of the detection\nRange \u2013 The distance from the radar to the meteor trail\nSNR \u2013 The signal to noise ratio of the detection\nAngle of arrival \u2013 The azimuth and zenith angles of the direction from the radar to the meteor trail\nDecay time \u2013 The exponential decay time of the detected signal (and its error)\nDiffusion coefficient \u2013 An inferred trail diffusion coefficient (and its error)\nRadial velocity \u2013 The speed with which the trail was moving toward or away (positive) from the radar (and its error)\nPhase differences \u2013 The mean phase differences for each pair combination of the five antennas.\n\nIf enough meteors are detected, it is possible to infer a horizontal wind field at the height of the detections. This is done my assuming the wind flows without divergence or convergence in the vicinity of the radar over a selected averaging interval. Horizontal and vertical components of the wind are derived in this way and stored with their heights. These data are stored in files with a \u2018.vel\u2019 extension. \n\nData collection began in 2003 and is ongoing within scheduling constraints.\n\nProject History:\nThe operation of the Davis 55MHz meteor detection radar began with:\nProject 2529 \u2013 \u2018A Meteor Radar for Measuring Mesospheric and Lower Thermospheric Winds and Temperatures at Davis Station\u2019. 2004/05 to 2008/09.\n\nTechnical History:\nSummer 2002/03 \u2013 The 55MHz meteor antenna array was constructed as part of the MST radar installation using antennas, cabling and switching provided by ATRAD and the University of Adelaide.  \nChanges to the MST radar transmitter and beam steering unit since that time have not affected the 55MHz meteor detection operation.",
