    "description": "These estimates are intended for large-scale ground- and surface-water\nanalyses of nutrient sources or changes in these sources. These data on\nnutrients in manure can be compared to fertilizer inputs of nutrients.\n\nThis data set contains county estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus content of\nanimal wastes produced annually for the years 1982, 1987, and 1992. The\nestimates are based on animal populations for those years from the 1992 Census\nof Agriculture (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1995) and methods for estimating the\nnutrient content of manure from the Soil Conservation Service (1992).\n\nThe data set includes several components..\n\n1. Spatial component - generalized county boundaries in ARC/INFO format/1/,\nincluding nine INFO lookup tables containing animal counts and nutrient\nestimates keyed to the county polygons using county code. (The county lines\nwere not used in the nutrient computations and are provided for displaying the\ndata as a courtesy to the user.) The data is organized by 5-digit state/county\nFIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) code. Another INFO table lists\nthe county names that correspond to the FIPS codes.\n\n2. Tabular component - Nine tab-delimited ASCII lookup tables of animal counts\nand nutrient estimates organized by 5-digit state/county FIPS (Federal\nInformation Processing Standards) code. Another table lists the county names\nthat correspond to the FIPS codes.\n\nThe amount of nitrogen and phosphorus present in manure (in kilograms) has been\ncalculated for each county of the United States. The procedure is identical to\nthat of Smith and others (1997), which covered the year 1987. Nutrient\nestimates for the years 1982 and 1987 were computed again for the data set\nhere, and the results were checked against the results computed previously by\nAlexander (written commun., 1992) for those years to ensure that they were\nidentical.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe estimates are county level and are based on estimates of the nutrient\ncontent of animal manure produced per 1,000 pounds of animal weight on a daily\nbasis.\n\nOne important limitation of the animal population numbers from the Census of\nAgriculture is that for some counties and animal classes, no data are reported.\nThis limitation reportedly is the result of restrictions on including animal\npopulation data for counties where animal production is dominated or limited to\none business or farm. These data therefore are considered trade secrets and may\nnot be included in the county-based data. This limitation on population data at\nthe county level results in discrepancies when county-based data are summed and\ncompared to national animal population totals. At the present we have no way of\nestimating animal populations for those counties with missing data and further\nhave no way of determining which counties are missing data. Therefore, the\nanimal manure, nitrogen and phosphorus estimates for some counties are an\nunderestimate of the total nutrient form animal manure in those counties.",
