    "description": "---- Public Summary from Project ----\nUnderstanding the strength of possible biological feedbacks is crucial to the science of climate change. This project aims to improve our understanding of one such feedback, the biogenic production of dimethylsulphide (DMS) and its impact on atmospheric aerosols. The Antarctic ocean is potentially a major source of DMS-derived aerosols. The project will investigate the coupling between satellite-derived aerosol optical depth, phytoplankton biomass and DMS production in the Antarctic Southern Ocean.\n\nFrom the abstract of the attached paper:\n\nWe analysed the correlation between zonal mean satellite data on surface chlorophyll (CHL) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), in the Southern Ocean (in 5-degree bands between 50-70 degrees south) for the period 1997-2004), and in sectors of the Eastern Antarctic, Ross and Weddell Seas.  Seasonality is moderate to strong in both CHL and AOD signatures throughout the study region.  Coherence in the CHL and AOD time series is strong between 50-60 degrees south, however this synchrony is absent south of 60 degrees south. Marked interannual variability in CHL occurs south of 60 degrees south.  We find a clear latitudinal difference in the cross-correlation between CHL and AOD, with the AOD peak preceding the CHL bloom by up to six weeks in the sea ice zone (SIZ).  This is consistent with the ventilation of dimethysulphide (DMS) from sea-ice during melting, and supports field data that records high levels of sulfur species in sea-ice and surface seawater during ice-melt.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nTimeseries Worksheet:\n\nDate\nMean Chlorophyll (mg CHL/cubic metre)\nMean Aerosol Optical Depth (no units)\n5 Day mean chlorophyll averages\n5 day mean aerosol optical depth averages\n\nCorrelation Worksheet:\n\nn - number\nlag\nr - correlation coefficient\nt - student t statistic\n\nGlobal Worksheet\n\nColumn A = SeaWiFS filename\nCounter+1 is a counter to indicate the image number in series\nDate\nMean Chlorophyll (mg CHL/cubic metre)\nMean Aerosol Optical Depth (no units)\nChlorophyll Standard Deviation\nMean Aerosol Optical Depth Standard Deviation\nChlorophyll Standard Error\nMean Aerosol Optical Depth Standard Error\nChlorophyll Count (the number of data 'pixels' in the image - the basic pixel size is 9x9km2)\nMean Aerosol Optical Depth (the number of data 'pixels' in the image - the basic pixel size is 9x9km2)",
