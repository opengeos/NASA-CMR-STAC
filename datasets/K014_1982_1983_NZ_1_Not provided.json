    "description": "In January-February 1983, a four person party spent five weeks at Cape Hallett, Northern Victoria Land, under the auspices of the New Zealand Committee for the International Survey of Antarctic Seabirds (ISAS). The major objectives of this expedition were a census of the Adelie penguin and skua populations and a study of the foods of Adelie penguins. The last penguin census at Cape Hallett prior to this was in 1968. The old Cape Hallett station was abandoned in 1973 and the recovery of the penguin population was checked.  All chicks were counted in each colony and their number was compared with counts made in 1961 and aerial photographs from 1982. A skua census was also completed in two separate counts. The feeding ecology of adelie penguins was examined to take the opportunity for making comparisons with results from earlier studies at Cape Hallett.  Stomach samples were collected at the creche stage from 76 adult penguins. The penguins were captured as they returned from feeding at sea and stomach contents were sampled using the wet offloading techniqe. The type, abundance and characteristics of the prey species was determine and compared.",
