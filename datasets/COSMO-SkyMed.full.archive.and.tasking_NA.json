Any geometric correction derived by usage of terrain model isn't applied to this product by default - GTC (Level 1D, Geocoded Terrain Corrected): focused data, fully calibrated with the usage of terrain model, amplitude detected, optionally despeckled by multi-looking approach, geolocated on a DEM and represented in a uniform preselected cartographic presentation. The image scene is located and accurately rectified onto a map projection, through the use of Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM); it differs from GEC for the use of the DEM (instead of reference ellipsoid) for the accurate conversion from slant to ground range and to approximate the real earth surface  The list of available data can be retrieved using the _$$CLEOS COSMO-SkyMed products catalogue$$ https://www.cleos.earth/ .
