    "description": "The data were produced by four separate projects: Coastal Gradients of Flow, Salintiy, and Nutrients; Freshwater Flows to Northeastern Florida Bay; Hydrologic Monitoring in Joe Bay; and Southwest Florida Coastal and Wetland Systems Monitoring. Data are available for 43 separate sites.\n\nThe Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 authorized the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) as a framework for modifications and operational changes to the Central and Southern Florida Project needed to restore the south Florida ecosystem. Provisions within WRDA 2000 provide for specific authorization for an adaptive assessment and monitoring program. A Monitoring and Assessment Plan (MAP) has been developed as the primary tool to assess the system-wide performance of the CERP by the REstoration, COordination and VERification (RECOVER) program. The MAP presents the monitoring and supporting enhancement of scientific information and technology needed to measure the responses of the South Florida ecosystem. Hydrologic information throughout the Everglades ecosystem is key to the development of restoration strategies and for future evaluation of restoration results. There are significant hydrologic information gaps throughout the Everglades wetlands and estuaries that need to be addressed, particularly along Florida\u0092s southwest coast. Among these gaps are flow, water level, and salinity data.",
