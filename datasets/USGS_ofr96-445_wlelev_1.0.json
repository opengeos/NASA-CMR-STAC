    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data set that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis. \n\nThis data set consists of digital water-level elevation contours for the\nalluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron River in northwestern Oklahoma\nduring 1985-86. Ground water in 1,305 square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial\nand terrace deposits along the the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie is an\nimportant source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and\ndomestic supplies. Alluvial and terrace deposits are composed of interfingering\nlenses of clay, sandy clay, and cross-bedded poorly sorted sand and gravel. The\naquifer is composed of hydraulically connected alluvial and terrace deposits\nthat unconformably overlie the Permian-age Formations.\n\nWater-level elevations measured in 1985 and 1986 ranged from 1,650 feet to 950\nfeet above sea level. Regional ground-water flow is generally southeast to\nsouthwest towards the Cimarron River, except where the flow direction is\naffected by perennial tributaries. The water-level elevation contours were\ndigitized from a mylar map at a scale of 1:250,000. The maps were published at\na scale of 1:900,000.",
