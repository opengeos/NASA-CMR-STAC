    "description": "North-central and northeast Nevada contains numerous large plutons and smaller\nstocks but also contains many small, shallowly emplaced intrusive bodies,\nincluding dikes, sills, and intrusive lava dome complexes. Decades of geologic\ninvestigations in the study area demonstrate that many ore deposits,\nrepresenting diverse ore deposit types, are spatially, and probably temporally\nand genetically, associated with these igneous intrusions. However, despite the\nnumber and importance of igneous instrusions in the study area, no synthesis of\ngeochemical data available for these rocks has been completed. This report\npresents a synthesis of composition and age data for these rocks. The product\nrepresents the first phases of an effort to evaluate the\ntime-space-compositional evolution of Mesozoic and Cenozoic magmatism in the\nstudy area and identify genetic associations between magmatism and mineralizing\nprocesses in this region.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
