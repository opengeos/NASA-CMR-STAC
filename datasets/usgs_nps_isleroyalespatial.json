    "description": "The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction with the Biological Resources\nDivision (BRD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has implemented a program\nto \"develop a uniform hierarchical vegetation methodology\" at a national level.\nThe program will also create a geographic information system (GIS) database for\nthe parks under its management. The purpose of the data is to document the\nstate of vegetation within the NPS service area during the 1990's, thereby\nproviding a baseline study for further analysis at the Regional or Service-wide\nlevel. The vegetation units of this map were determined through stereoscopic\ninterpretation of aerial photographs supported by field sampling and ecological\nanalysis. The vegetation boundaries were identified on the photographs by means\nof the photographic signatures and collateral information on slope, hydrology,\ngeography, and vegetation in accordance with the Standardized National\nVegetation Classification System (October 1995). The mapped vegetation reflects\nconditions that existed during the specific year and season that the aerial\nphotographs were taken (spring - 1996 and fall - 1994).  There is an inherent\nmargin of error in the use of aerial photography for vegetation delineation and\nclassification.\n\nThe purpose of this spatial data is to provide the National Park Service the\nnecessary tools to wisely manage the natural resources within this park system.\nSeveral parks, representing different regions, environmental conditions, and\nvegetation types, were chosen by BRD to be part of the prototype phase of the\nprogram. The initial goal of the prototype phase is to \"develop, test, refine,\nand finalize the standards and protocols\" to be used during the production\nphase of the project. This includes the development of a standardized\nvegetation classification system for each park and the establishment of\nphotointerpretation, field, and accuracy assessment procedures. Isle Royale\nNational Park was initially identified as one of the prototypes within the\nNational Park System for the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. Isle Royale\nNational Park was established March 3, 1931 and was also designated as an\nInternational Biosphere Reserve in 1980. The park contains approximately\n571,790 acres of land and water (893 square miles) of which 133,782 acres is\nland and the rest is open water of Lake Superior as well as inland lakes and\nponds. Isle Royale National Park is an archipelago of islands located in the\nnorthwestern region of Lake Superior close to the United States-Canada border.\nThe main island, Isle Royale, consists of a series of ridges and valleys\nrunning the length of the island and is surrounded by approximately 200 smaller\nislands. The primary methods of transportation on the island are hiking and\nboating. Isle Royale National Park was authorized on March 3, 1931; it was\nformally established in 1940, and officially dedicated in 1946. Most of the\npark's land area (98%) was designated as a Wilderness area in October 1976, and\nlater additions increased the total Wilderness to 99% of the park. The park was\ndesignated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980.\n\nIsle Royale National Park is an archipelago of islands located in the\nnorthwestern region of Lake Superior close to the United States-Canada border.\nThe park is located about 60 miles northwest of Michigan.s Keweenaw Peninsula,\nabout 22 miles east of Grand Portage, Minnesota, and about 35 miles southeast\nof Thunder Bay, Ontario.\n\nInformation for this metadata was obtained from the site\n\"http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/isro/metaisrospatial.html\" and converted to\nNASA Directory Interchange Format.",
