    "description": "Samples are from the SRE4 experiment - an in situ experiment to determine fate and effects of different types of oils in the Antarctic marine environment.  For details see: Powell S.M., Snape I., Bowman J.P., Thompson B.A.W., Stark J.S., McCammon S.A., Riddle M.J.  2005.  A comparison of the short term effects of diesel fuel and lubricant oils on Antarctic benthic microbial communities.  Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 322:53-65.\n\nSamples were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with primers specific for the Desulfobacula group.\n\nSamples A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I are all initial samples collected different days\nSamples beginning T0 are predeployment samples, the next number refers to the batch.\nSamples beginning T2 are 1 year samples with:\nC = control     \nS = SAB \nL = lubricant\nU = used lubricant\nB = biodegradable lubricant\n\nPCR conditions were as follows:\nPrimers:  764F:  ACAATGGTAAATGAGGGCA\n1392RC: CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCCACGGGCGG TGTGTAC\n\n50 ul (micro litre) reactions with Advantage II taq (Clontech) following manufacturer's recommendations with 20 pmol (pico mol) each primer and 20 ng (nano gram) template DNA.\n\nCycling: 94C 5 minutes   \n10 cycles of:\n94C 1 minutes   \n65C 1 minutes (-1C per cycle)   \n72C 2 minutes   \n\n\n20 cycles of:\n94C 1 minutes   \n55C 1 minutes   \n72C 2 minutes   \n72C 30 minutes  \n\nDGGE carried out using the D-Code system (BioRad).\nGel: 8% acrylamide 30 - 65% denaturant with 2 cm stacking gel (15% acrylamide)     \n1 x TAE, 60 degrees C, 70V 16 hours     \nThe gels were pre-run for 20 minutes then half reaction volume was loaded and the lanes flushed out after 15 minutes.\nGels were stained with SYBRGold.\nImages were captured using Storm Phosphorimager and ImageQuant v5.2 software(.gel files).\n\nSamples were only compared within a gel. Band pattern results are in the file desulfodgge.xls. For each comparison made there is a separate sheet in this file (see below). The first column in each sheet is the band position (or band name) and the remaining columns are samples with the first row being the sample name. '0' '1' indicate the band was 'absent' or 'present'.\n\nComparison              Image files (.gel and .tif)     results sheets\nBackground variation    140704f; 140704b        140704f and 140704b\npredeployment batches   180604f; 180406b        180604f and 180604b\neffect of setup         150704                   150704\nimmediate effect of oil 250604f; 250604b        250604f and 250604b\n1 year samples (T2)     040804f; 040804b        040804f and 040804b\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 1228 and 2201 (ASAC_1228, ASAC_2201).",
