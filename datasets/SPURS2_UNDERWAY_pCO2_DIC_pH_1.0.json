    "description": "The SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) project is a NASA-funded oceanographic process study and associated field program that aim to elucidate key mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the oceans. The project is comprised of two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes. SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D, SMAP and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales. The SPURS-2 campaign involved two month-long cruises by the R/V Revelle in August 2016 and October 2017 combined with complementary sampling on a more continuous basis over this period by the schooner Lady Amber. Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. During both Revelle cruises, continuous measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and pH at surface (0m) and 5m depths were made on water pumped continuously from the Salinity Snake and the ship's intake port.  In addition to these measurements, observational data from the salinity snake and thermosalinograph also include water temperature and salinity time series at the same depths. The temporal resolution of the observations range from 3 seconds (pH) to 3 minutes (DIC). All pCO2 and associated underway data comprising this dataset are in netCDF file format with standards compliant metadata.  Due to issues with the quality of the 2016 underway data, only the data file for the 2017 cruise is available.",
