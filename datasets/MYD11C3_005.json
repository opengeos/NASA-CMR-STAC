    "description": "The MYD11C3.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \n\nThe MODIS/Aqua LST/E Monthly L3 Global CMG product (Short name: MYD11C3) is a monthly composited average, derived from the MYD11C1 daily global product, and stored as clear-sky LST values during a month\u2019s period in a 0.05\u00ba (5600 meters) geographic CMG. MYD11C3, therefore, inherits all the structural features of its MYD11C1 parent except for the temporal configuration. Please refer to the MYD11C1 product documentation for all algorithm-related details.\n\nThe MYD11C3 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and emissivities for Bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32.\n\nThe V5 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11C3, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\n\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\nThe V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.  Please refer to the LP DAAC MODIS product table at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/myd11c3  for additional detailed product version information.\n\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \nArea: Global \nImage Dimensions: 3600 x 7200 (rows/columns) \nFile Size: ~80 MB Compressed \nResolution: 0.05 degree (~5600 meters at the Equator) \nProjection: Geographic (lat/lon grid)\nData Format: HDF-EOS \nScience Data Sets (HDF SDS Layers): 17\nTemporal Range: 2002-08-01 to 2017-03-01",
