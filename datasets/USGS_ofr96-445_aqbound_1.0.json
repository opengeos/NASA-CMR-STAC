    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data set that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.\n\nThis data set consists of digital aquifer boundaries for the alluvial and\nterrace deposits along the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie in\nnorthwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in 1,305 square miles of Quaternary-age\nalluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron River from Freedom to Guthrie\nis an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock,\nand domestic supplies. Alluvial and terrace deposits are composed of\ninterfingering lenses of clay, sandy clay, and cross-bedded poorly sorted sand\nand gravel. The aquifer is composed of hydraulically connected alluvial and\nterrace deposits that uncomfortably overlie the Permian-age Formations.\n\nThe aquifer boundaries along geological contacts were extracted from published\ndigital geology data sets. Additional boundaries defining the geographic limits\nof the aquifer and areas of less than 5 feet saturated thickness were digitized\nfrom a mylar map, at a scale of 1:250,000. The maps were published at a scale\nof 1:900,000.",
