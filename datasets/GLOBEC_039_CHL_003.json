    "description": "Analysis of the distribution of low oxygen concentrations and\nbiogenic elements associated with the Equatorial Subsurface water\nand characterization of seasonal and inter-annual variability in the\nHumboldt Current System off Chile.\n\nThe Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW), which is characterized by low\ndissolved oxygen content (<2 ml l-1) and high nutrient concentrations,\nis one of the main sources of upwelling water in the area.  It is\nnoticeable that the upper boundary of the oxygen minimum layer (OML)\nis found at shallower depths in the coastal zone (25-50m) than in the\nadjacent oceanic waters (50-100m), both off northern Chile and Peru.\nThis is a special feature of the Humboldt Current Eastern Boundary\nSystem and is associated with an important de-nitrification regime in\nthe water column.  Before this work was completed, information on the\nsources of variability associated with the distribution of the ESSW\nOML, the impact of these changes upon pelagic productivity in the\nregion and biogeochemical cycling was very limited.\n\nThe study was focused on three main areas:\n\n- The distribution of low oxygen concentrations in the HCS\n- Biogeochemical cycling in relation to the OML in the ESSW\n- Biological/ecological effects upon pelagic organisms of the\nOML in the ESSW",
