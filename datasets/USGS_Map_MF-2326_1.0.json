    "description": "This map has been prepared to provide the first detailed view of the Palisade\n1:24,000-scale quadrangle. Previous geologic mapping that encompassed the map\narea was at scales of 1:100,000 and 1: 250,000. The Palisade area is an\nimportant agricultural region of Colorado, fruit orchards were first\nestablished in the area in the late 19th century. In addition, the Palisade\nquadrangle is undergoing rapid growth, as is the rest of the Grand Valley.\nBecause of this rapid growth, the recognition of geologic hazards is important.\nThe map depicts many surficial units associated with geologic hazards. The map\nis accompanied by a separate leaflet containing a section on geologic hazards\n(including landslides, piping, gullying, expansive soils, and flooding). A\ntable indicates what map units are susceptible to a given hazard. The map will\nbe of interest to town and county officials, land- use planners, as well as the\ngeneral public.\n\nThe Palisade 1:24,000 quadrangle is in Mesa County in western Colorado. Because\nthe map area is dominated by various surficial deposits, the map depicts 22\ndifferent Quaternary units. Two prominent river terraces are present in the\nquadrangle containing gravels deposited by the Colorado River.  The map area\ncontains many mass movement deposits. Extensive landslide deposits are present\nalong the eastern part of the quadrangle. These massive landslides originate on\nthe flanks of Grand Mesa, in the Green River and Wasatch Formations, and flow\nwest onto the Palisade quadrangle. In addition, large areas of the eastern and\nsouthern parts of the map are covered by extensive pediment surfaces. These\npediment surfaces are underlain by debris flow deposits also originating from\nGrand Mesa. Material in these deposits consists of mainly subangular basalt\ncobbles and boulders and indicate that these debris flow deposits have traveled\nas much as 10 km from their source area. The pediment surfaces have been\ndivided into 5 age classes based on their height above surrounding drainages. \n\nTwo common bedrock units in the map area are the Mancos Shale and the Mesaverde\nGroup both of Upper Cretaceous age. The Mancos shale is common in low lying\nareas near the western map border. The Mesaverde Group forms prominent\nsandstone cliffs in the north-central map area.\n\nThe map is accompanied by a separate pamphlet containing unit descriptions, a\nsection on geologic hazards (including landslides, piping, gullying, expansive\nsoils, and flooding), and a section on economic geology (including sand and\ngravel, and coal). A table indicates what map units are susceptible to a given\nhazard. Approximately twenty references are cited at the end of the report.\n\nMap political location: Mesa County, Colorado\n\nCompilation scale: 1:24,000\n\nGeology mapped in 1996 and 1997",
