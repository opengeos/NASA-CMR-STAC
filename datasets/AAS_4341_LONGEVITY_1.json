    "description": "Longevity, development and flowering data for Stellaria media plants on Macquarie Island.\n    \nThere are 5 spreadsheets here on the longevity, development and flowering of Stellaria media plants on Macquarie Island. In building a picture of infestations of Stellaria media the first spreadsheet provides density and percent cover of Stellaria media in the densest areas of the weed at 4 sites. The second spreadsheet provides data on the survival of tagged plants over 2 years. The third spreadsheet shows how many seeds are produced by Stellaria media plants of different sizes and whether those plants were growing above or below (ie their dominance towards) other vegetation. The next spreadsheet shows data on 20 plants that were temporarily tagged at several sites and monitored for several months to assess changes in reproductive capacity (buds, flowers, seed pods) over time.  In the final spreadsheet we provide data on the development over a one week period of individual flowers.  More detailed methods are given in each of the files.\n\n20 plants tagged at each of 3 sites (GPS referenced) for long term monitoring, with seedlings also monitored during the summer for their development, size (height and diameter) and time to flowering.",
