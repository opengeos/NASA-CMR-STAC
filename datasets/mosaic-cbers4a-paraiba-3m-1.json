    "description": "CBERS-4A/WFI image mosaic of Brazil Para\u00edba State with 55m of spatial resolution. The mosaic was prepared in order to demonstrate the technological capabilities of the Brazil Data Cube project tools. The false color composition is based on the WFI bands 16, 15 and 14 assigned to RGB channels. The temporal composition encompasses 03-months of images, starting in July 2020 and ending in September 2020, with a best pixel selection approach called Least Cloud Cover First (LCF). More information on LCF can be found at Brazil Data Cube web site (https://brazil-data-cube.github.io/specifications/processing-flow.html#temporal-compositing). This Image Mosaic used more than 50 CBERS-4A scenes and was generated based on an existing CBERS-4A/WFI image collection.",
