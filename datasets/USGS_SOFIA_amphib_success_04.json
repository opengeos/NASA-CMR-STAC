    "description": "We will use established sampling methodologies such as mark-recapture to investigate survival, movement, and density, develop new methods for sampling across hydroperiod gradients (drift fence arrays), and use newly developed statistical techniques to estimate the proportion of area occupied by and to define amphibian communities. Our objectives include: 1. Define amphibian communities appropriate for evaluating restoration success. 2. Develop methods for measuring the area occupancy of amphibian communities across habitats and environmental gradients. 3. Investigate the relationship of occupancy, survival, movement probability, and density with hydroperiod and other environmental factors. 4. Develop restoration targets for the amphibian community of the Everglades. 5. Develop a restoration tool for amphibian communities that measures restoration success and compares restoration alternatives. 6. Develop an index of biological integrity for amphibians that provides a framework for scientifically defensible decisions by restoration managers.\n\nAmphibians are present in all habitats and under all hydrologic regimes in the Everglades. The species present and the occupancy rate of a given species differ greatly across those gradients. These differences are due to hydropattern, vegetation, and other environmental factors. The combination of species composition and proportion of each habitat occupied at a given time form unique communities defined by those environmental factors. Therefore, if these communities can be reliably defined and measured, Everglades restoration success can be evaluated. This project will develop methodologies for defining and measuring the membership and area occupancy and of amphibian communities. Further, we will investigate the relationship of occupancy, survival, movement probability, and density of amphibians with hydroperiod and other environmental factors. Finally, we will provide a method for measuring restoration success based on these communities. The importance of amphibian communities to Everglades restoration has been recognized and listed as critical priority research needs.",
