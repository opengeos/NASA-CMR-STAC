    "description": "In-depth research has been conducted into sea ice thickness in the McMurdo Sound. The subice platelet layer thickness under sea ice was measured in regular intervals at two North-South oriented profiles and four east-west oriented profiles. Holes were drilled at regular intervals into sea ice at measurement sites about 5 km apart. At these holes sea ice thickness and snow depth on top of the sea ice was measured. In between the sites, sea ice thickness was measured using an electromagnetic induction device, and snow on sea ice was measured using a ground penetrating radar system. Ocean temperature and salinity was measured through holes in the sea ice along the ice edge of the McMurdo Ice Shelf within 3 km of the ice shelf front. The response of the sea ice to tidal height was measured at three locations using GPS Stations. At these locations samples of sea ice were taken for geophysical, oceanographic and biological analysis. Water samples were also taken.\n\nSea ice thickness (surface elevation and draft of sea ice) and surface reflectance was measured along ten North-South oriented profiles and eight east-west oriented profiles. This was performed by the HEM bird and the ground measurements validate these results.",
