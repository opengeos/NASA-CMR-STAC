    "description": "From the project summary:\n\nBoth satellite products and climate models have large biases in the energy and water budgets over the Southern Ocean (SO), which is not surprising given this environment's unique nature. The air is free of dust and pollution, and the surface is governed by strong winds, large waves and heavy sea spray. These conditions lead to the greatest fractional cloud cover over any place on the globe. Much of these biases are a direct consequence of a poor understanding of the structure and dynamics of the SO atmospheric boundary layer, which in turn is a consequence of the sparse observations being available due to the harsh conditions. This proposals call for employing unmanned aerial vehicles/systems from Macquarie Island to make unprecedented observations of the boundary layer processes over the SO. These observations will be used to both model the boundary layer dynamics and clouds and evaluate satellite products and numerical simulations of surface fluxes, cloud properties and sea spray.\n    \nThe data was recorded at lat: -54.5, lon:158.935. The observations include measurements of Absolute Humidity, Carbon Concentration, 3D wind, pressure, and ambient temperature.\nThe data is in netcdf4 format with medium compression, and have all available information in the attributes of each variable. The data can be easily previewed with an application like Panoply (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/).\nThe variable names are:\nAh_7500  \nCc_7500  \nDiag_7500\nDiag_CSAT\nTa_HMP   \nTv_CSAT  \nUx_CSAT  \nUy_CSAT  \nUz_CSAT  \ne_HMP    \nps_7500  \ntime",
