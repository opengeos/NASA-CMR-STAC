    "description": "The TES Aura L3 ATD data consist of daily atmospheric temperature and VMR for the atmospheric species. Data are provided at 2 degree latitude X 4 degree longitude spatial grids and at a subset of TES standard pressure levels. The TES Science Data Processing L3 subsystem interpolates the L2 atmospheric profiles collected in a Global Survey onto a global grid uniform in latitude and longitude to provide a 3-D representation of the distribution of atmospheric gasses. Daily and monthly averages of L2 profiles and browse images are available. The L3 standard data products are composed of L3 HDF - EOS-EOS grid data. A separate product file is produced for each different atmospheric species. TES obtains data in two basic observation modes: Limb or Nadir. The product file may contain, in separate folders, limb data, nadir data, or both folders may be present. Specific to L3 processing are the terms 'Daily' and 'Monthly' representing the approximate time coverage of the L3 products. However the input data granules to the L3 process are complete Global Surveys; in other words a Global Survey will not be split in relation to time when input to the L3 processes even if they exceed the usual understood meanings of a day or month. More specifically, Daily L3 products represent a single Global Survey (approximately 26 hours) and Monthly L3 products represent Global Surveys that are initiated within that calendar month. The data granules defined for L3 standard products are 'daily' and 'monthly'. L3 data is provided at uniform grids in latitude and longitude and at selected pressure levels. Details of the format of this product can be found in the TES Data Products Specifications (DPS) which is available from the LaRC ASDC site: https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/tes/DPS",
