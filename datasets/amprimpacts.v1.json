    "description": "The Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) IMPACTS dataset consists of brightness temperature measurements collected by the Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) onboard the NASA ER-2 high-altitude research aircraft. AMPR provides multi-frequency microwave imagery, with high spatial and temporal resolution for deriving cloud, precipitation, water vapor and surface properties. These measurements were taken during the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) campaign. Funded by NASA\u2019s Earth Venture program, IMPACTS is the first comprehensive study of East Coast snowstorms in 30 years. Data files are available from January 18, 2020 through February 28, 2022 in netCDF-4 format.  ",
