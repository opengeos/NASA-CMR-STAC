    "description": "This study describes the development of culturing and aqueous toxicity test procedures for the endemic Antarctic soil nematode Plectus murrayi (Yeates, 1970; Nematoda: Plectidae) and estimates of its sensitivity to aqueous copper (Cu).\n\nNematode collection details\nPlectus murrayi nematodes were isolated from soil and moss samples collected in the austral summer of 2013/14 at Clark Peninsula, Bailey Peninsula and Robinsons Ridge in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica (AAS 4100). P. murrayi nematodes were transferred to agar plates, then transported to AAD laboratories at Kingston where laboratory cultures were established. Cultures were maintained at 15 degrees C.\n\nPlectus murrayi culturing data\nA number of different culturing conditions were trialled to optimise reproductive output in cultures. Data on the abundance of Plectus murrayi nematodes and eggs on agar culture plates. AAS_4100_Pmurrayi_Agar.xlsx\n\nAqueous exposure \nThree solutions were tested to determine the optimum medium for P. murrayi in aqueous exposures. Survival was scored by the numbers of live and dead nematodes counted in each replicate. Hatching success was estimated as percent of eggs that hatched per replicate. Hatched juvenile survival was expressed as percent survival relative to hatching success for each replicate. AAS_4100_Pmurrayi_Aqueous_solution_egg_hatch_juv_adult_surv.xlsx\n\nSensitivity of Plectus murrayi to aqueous copper\nThe sensitivity of hatched juveniles to Cu was estimated after a total of 28 d exposure (egg to hatched J2 juvenile). Two tests. Survival was scored by the numbers of live and dead nematodes counted in each replicate. Hatching success was estimated as percent of eggs that hatched per replicate. Hatched juvenile survival was counted in one test and was expressed as percent survival relative to hatching success for each replicate. AAS_4100_Pmurrayi_Cu_egg hatch_juv_survival.xlsx\nJuvenile survival in aqueous copper. Two tests. Survival was scored by the numbers of live and dead nematodes counted in each replicate. AAS_4100_Pmurrayi_Cu_juv_survival.xlsx\t\nAqueous copper concentrations in tests were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) (Varian 720-ES). The measured dissolved Cu concentrations (\u00b5g/L) used in statistical analyses of sensitivity estimates was the geometric mean of initial and final concentrations for each treatment. Copper concentrations are given in the spreadsheets for tests with copper.",
