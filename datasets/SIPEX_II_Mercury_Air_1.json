    "description": "Instrument description:\nGaseous elemental mercury  (GEM) was measured at five minute intervals. GEM was collected and analysed on two parallel gold traps. While GEM was collected on one gold trap, the mercury on the other traps was simultaneously being thermally desorbed and detected by a cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometer. The Tekran was calibrated approximately every 24 - 48 hours using an internal Hg permeation source. The internal calibration source was checked prior to shipping the instrument to Australia using an external Hg source. The internal calibration source will be verified upon return of the instrument.  \n\nInstrument Setup:\nThis instrument was sampling from a weather protected inlet positioned ~3 m off the front port side of the Monkey Deck of the Aurora Australis, directly above the bridge. The 35m heated Teflon sample line end and filter is contained within the \"Ned Kelly\", a large (~30 cm diameter) stainless steel can which protects against rain, snow, sea spray and major impacts. This sample line ran 25m down to the Tekran instrument which was located in a the Met-Lab. Ar (99.999% purity) was fed into the MetLab via quarter inch Teflon tubing from the oxygen store on the Monkey deck. \nA 2D R.M. Young (model 5305-AQ) anemometer was also deployed at the same elevation on the aft side of the sample inlet. The anemometer was oriented with zero degrees pointed directly forward of the ship. Mean Wind speed and direction were captured using Campbell Scientific CR1000 datalogger at five-minute intervals.\n\nThe files included in this dataset are the raw outputs from the Tekran 2537. They include headers, though not always at the top of the file, because headers are only written when the instrument is started or after recalibration. Also included are scanned log books containing meteorological observations, maintenance notes, and when adjustments were made to the sample line (which alters anemometer data).",
