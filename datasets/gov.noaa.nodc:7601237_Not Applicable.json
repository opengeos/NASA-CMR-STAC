    "description": "The Patuxent River estuary was investigated over a 25-hour tidal cycle from October 17-18, 1972, during the Patuxent River Cooperative Study (conducted by the University of Maryland). These data were collected as part of a joint investigation by the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (Chesapeake Biological Lab) and the Institute for Fluid Dynamics and Applied Mathematics (College Park, Maryland). The resulting chemical, physical, and biological data were assembled into a format that could be utilized by investigators, collectively titled the Patuxent River Data Bank.\n\nThe Patuxent River Data Bank was submitted to NODC on a 9-track, 1600 BPI tape in EBCDIC and contains headers and one data file.\n\nHeat concentration (in kilocalories/liter) and instantaneous flux magnitude (in megacalories/square meter/second) were recorded over the tidal cycle. Other data associated with this study are filed under NODC Reference #'s L01574 and L01576; all data are in the Level-A directory under L01574.001.\n\nData associated with marine chemistry include: Dissolved organic carbon (milligrams/liter), Particulate carbon (milligrams/liter), salts (grams/liter), Dissolved oxygen (milligrams/liter), and total particulates (milligrams/liter). Instantaneous flux magnitudes for carbon were measured in grams/liter; for salts, in kilograms/liter; for oxygen, in milligrams/liter; and for total particulates, milligrams/liter.\n\nParameters associated with primary productivity (L505) include: Nitrate +Nitrite conc., Ammonia Nitrogen conc., Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Organic Phosphate conc., Total Hydrolyzable Phosphate, Active Chlorophyll-a, and Total Chlorophyll. Nutrients were measured in milligrams/liter; chlorophyll concentrations were measured in micrograms/liter. Instantaneous flux magnitudes were measured in milligrams/square meter/second.\n\nAdditional data collected during this investigation are filed under NODC Reference #'s L01575 and one tape of Patuxent River Estuary Hydro data \"OLD STUFF\"",
