    "description": "A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was used to map the relative vulnerability\nof the coast to future sea-level rise within Cape Hatteras National Seashore\n(CAHA) in North Carolina. The CVI ranks the following in terms of their\nphysical contribution to sea-level rise-related coastal change: geomorphology,\nregional coastal slope, rate of relative sea-level rise, historical shoreline\nchange rates, mean tidal range, and mean significant wave height. The rankings\nfor each variable were combined and an index value was calculated for 1-minute\ngrid cells covering the park. The CVI highlights those regions where the\nphysical effects of sea-level rise might be the greatest. This approach\ncombines the coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability\nto adapt to changing environmental conditions, yielding a quantitative,\nalthough relative, measure of the park's natural vulnerability to the effects\nof sea-level rise. The CVI provides an objective technique for evaluation and\nlong-term planning by scientists and park managers. Cape Hatteras National\nSeashore consists of stable and washover dominated segments of barrier beach\nbacked by wetland and marsh. The areas within Cape Hatteras that are likely to\nbe most vulnerable to sea-level rise are those with the highest occurrence of\noverwash and the highest rates of shoreline change.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
