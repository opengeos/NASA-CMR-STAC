    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) World Petroleum Assessment 2000 provides\nestimates of the quantities of conventional oil, gas, and natural gas liquids\noutside the United States that have the potential to be added to reserves in\nthe next 30 years (1995 to 2025). Excluding the U.S., the mean (expected)\nvolumes of undiscovered resources are 649 billion barrels of oil (BBO), 4,669\ntrillion cubic feet of gas (TCFG), and 207 billion barrels of natural gas\nliquids (BBNGL).\n\nThis assessment is based on extensive geologic studies as opposed to\nstatistical analysis. A team of more than 40 geoscientists and additional\nsupporting staff conducted the study over a five-year period from 1995 to 2000.\nThe petroleum assessed occurs in fields exceeding a stated minimum size, which\nvaries between 1 and 20 million barrels of oil equivalent in different areas,\nand in accumulation categories judged to be viable in a 30-year forecast span.\n\nThe critical geologic controls on petroleum distribution are encompassed by the\nTotal Petroleum System (TPS) and were studied using this approach. Assessment\nUnits (AU), within the TPS, were the basic units for assessment. Overall, 159\nTPS and 270 AU were identified in 96 countries and 2 jointly held areas. Of\nthese, 149\nTPS and 246 AU in 128 geologic provinces were quantitatively assessed. The\nassessed areas were those judged to be significant on a world scale in terms of\nknown petroleum volumes, geologic potential for new petroleum discoveries, and\npolitical or societal importance. In the course of our geologic analyses, 24 AU\nwere identified as containing continuous (nonconventional) resources, but these\nwere not quantitatively assessed.\n\nFor each AU, allocations of undiscovered resources were made to the countries,\ngeologic provinces, regions, and offshore areas (if any) involved. From these\nallocated portions, aggregations of estimates were made for higher levels such\nas to countries, geologic provinces, and groups of countries including the\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Organization\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nThe United States was not reassessed in this study; estimates previously made\nby the USGS in 1995 and the Minerals Management Service in 1996 were used for\ncomparative purposes. \n\nTo access the data and assessments, see \"http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-060/\"",
