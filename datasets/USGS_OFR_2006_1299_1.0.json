    "description": "A three-dimensional inversion of gravity data from the Rainier Mesa area and\nsurrounding regions reveals a topographically complex pre-Cenozoic basement\nsurface. This model of the depth to pre-Cenozoic basement rocks is intended for\nuse in a 3D hydrogeologic model being constructed for the Rainier Mesa area.\nPrior to this study, our knowledge of the depth to pre-Cenozoic basement rocks\nwas based on a regional model, applicable to general studies of the greater\nNevada Test Site area but inappropriate for higher resolution modeling of\nground-water flow across the Rainier Mesa area. The new model incorporates\nseveral changes that lead to significant improvements over the previous\nregional view. First, the addition of constraining wells, encountering old\nvolcanic rocks lying above but near pre-Cenozoic basement, prevents modeled\nbasement from being too shallow. Second, an extensive literature and well data\nsearch has led to an increased understanding of the change of rock density with\ndepth in the vicinity of Rainier Mesa. The third, and most important change,\nrelates to the application of several depth-density relationships in the study\narea instead of a single generalized relationship, thereby improving the\noverall model fit. In general, the pre-Cenozoic basement surface deepens in the\nwestern part of the study area, delineating collapses within the Silent Canyon\nand Timber Mountain caldera complexes, and shallows in the east in the Eleana\nRange and Yucca Flat regions, where basement crops out. In the Rainier Mesa\nstudy area, basement is generally shallow (< 1 km). The new model identifies\npreviously unrecognized structures within the pre-Cenozoic basement that may\ninfluence ground-water flow, such as a shallow basement ridge related to an\ninferred fault extending northward from Rainier Mesa into Kawich Valley.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
