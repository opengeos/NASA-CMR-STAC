    "description": "Laboratory studies with algae, aquatic invertebrates, and fish. Short-term\ntoxicity tests showed that both fire-retardant and foam-suppressant chemicals\nwere very toxic to aquatic organisms including algae, aquatic invertebrates,\nand fish. Foam-suppressant are more toxic than fire-retardant chemicals. The\nprimary toxicant in fire-retardants is the ammonia component, whereas the\nnitrite and nitrate components do not seem to contribute much to the toxicity\nof the formulations. In foam suppressants the primary toxicant is the\nsurfactant component. The most sensitive life-stage for fish is the swim-up\nstage.   Accidental spills of fire-fighting chemicals in streams could cause\nsubstantial fish kills depending on the stream size and flow rate. For example,\nthe retardant Fire-Trol GTS-R is prepared for field use by mixing 1.66 pounds\nper gallon of water to produce 1.1 gallons of slurry, which is equivalent to\n198,930 mg/liter. Comparing the concentration of FT GTS-R field mixture to the\nacute toxicity values for the most sensitive life stage for rainbow trout gives\na ratio of 853 in soft water and 1474 in hard water. Applying a safety factor\nof 100 to this ratio suggests a dilution of 85, 300 in soft water and 147,400\nin hard water is needed to lower the chemical concentration in a receiving\nwater to limit adverse effects, i.e., fish kill, in a stream. For rainbow\ntrout, other dilution factors would be 52,100 for Fire-Trol LCG-R, 85,600 for\nPhos-Chek D75-F, 71,400 for Phos-Chek WD-881, and 50,000 for Silv-ex.\nFire-fighting chemicals are very toxic in aquatic environments and fire control\nmanagers need to consider protection of aquatic resources, especially if\nendangered species are present.",
