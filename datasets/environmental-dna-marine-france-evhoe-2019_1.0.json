    "description": "Environmental DNA complements scientific trawling in surveys of marine fish biodiversity (Dataset 2019)  In October 2019 we chose 15 sites from the 2019 EVHOE survey for eDNA sampling. The French international EVHOE bottom trawl survey is carried out annually during autumn in the BoB to monitor demersal fish resources. At each site, we sampled seawater using Niskin bottles deployed with a circular rosette. There were nine bottles on the rosette, each of them able to hold \u223c5 l of water. At each site, we first cleaned the circular rosette and bottles with freshwater, then lowered the rosette (with bottles open) to 5 m above the sea bottom, and finally closed the bottles remotely from the boat. The 45 l of sampled water was transferred to four disposable and sterilized plastic bags of 11.25 l each to perform the filtration on-board in a laboratory dedicated to the processing of eDNA samples. To speed up the filtration process, we used two identical filtration devices, each composed of an Athena\u00ae peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC, Bradenton, Florida, USA; nominal flow of 1.0 l min\u20131 ), a VigiDNA 0.20 \u03bcm filtration capsule (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France), and disposable sterile tubing. Each filtration device filtered the water contained in two plastic bags (22.5 l), which represent two replicates per sampling site. We followed a rigorous protocol to avoid contamination during fieldwork, using disposable gloves and single-use filtration equipment and plastic bags to process each water sample. At the end of each filtration, we emptied the water inside the capsule that we replaced by 80 ml of CL1 conservation buffer and stored the samples at room temperature following the specifications of the manufacturer (SPYGEN, Le Bourget du Lac, France). We processed the eDNA capsules at SPYGEN, following the protocol proposed by Polanco-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., (2020). We performed library preparation and sequencing at Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland). Specifically, we prepared four libraries using the MetaFast protocol (a ligation-based method) and sequenced them separately. We carried out paired-end sequencing using a MiSeq sequencer (2 \u00d7 125 bp, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) on two MiSeq Flow Cell Kits (v3; Illumina), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. We analysed the sequence reads using the OBITools package (http://metabarcoding.org/obitools; Boyer et al., 2016), following the protocol described by Valentini et al. (2016).  Data content:  \t* rawdata/: contains the raw reads for each individual sample. One archive contains the paired-end reads specified by the _R1 or _R2 suffix as well as individually tagged PCR replicates (if available) together with an archive containing all extraction and PCR blank samples of the library. Reads have been demultiplexed using cutadapt but not trimmed, individual demultiplexing tags and primers remain present in the sequences.   \t* taxadata/: contains the table with all detected taxonomy for each sample after bioinformatic processing (see Polanco et al. 2020 for details; https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.140) and associated field metadata.  \t* metadata/: contains two metadata files, one related to the data collected in the field for each filter, and the second related to the sequencing process in the lab (including the tag sequence, library name, and marker information for each sample)",
