    "description": "At the end of life of each satellite, CNES issues a call for ideas for short-team experiments taking place before de-orbiting the satellite. CESBIO took the opportunity to propose the TAKE 5 experiment.The SPOT Take5 experiments consist in using SPOT as a simulator of the image time series that ESA's Sentinel-2 mission will provideOn January 29 2013, the orbit has been lowered from SPOT4's orbit by 3 kilometers to put it on a 5 day repeat cycle orbit, which means that the satellite has field the same place on earth every 5 days.Spot4 has followed this orbit unit the end of june 2013. During this period, 42 sites have been observed every 5 days, as in the case of Sentinel-2 with 2 satellites.  The succes of this experiment, with more than 700 users, pushed CNES and ESA to renew it with SPOT5 satellite.On April the 2nd, 2015, the orbit of SPOT5 was lowered by 3 km, to put in on a 5 day repeat cycle orbit. From that date, and for 5 months until the 15th of September, SPOT5 observed 150 sites every 5 days with constant observation angles. The data were processed and distributed by the MUSCATE prototype ground segment at CNES, within the THEIA ground segment : The data are freely available to all users with open license. \nAt the end of life of each of its satellites, CNES isues a call for ideas for experiments to be held after the end of the routine phase, and before the deorbitation. CESBIO used this opportunity to propose the Take5 experiment, which consisted in changing the orbit of SPOT4 to deliver Sentinel-2 like time series during 5 months. \n[https://www.theia-land.fr/en/products/]",
