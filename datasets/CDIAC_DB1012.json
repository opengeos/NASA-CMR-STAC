    "description": "This database (DB-1012) contains estimates of the net flux of\natmospheric-soil carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by the Amiotte Sucjet\nand Probst model(1993) and the associated bicarbonate river flux\n(HCO3-).  The data are referenced to a 1 degree by 1 degree global\ngrid.\n\nThe work was done at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\n(CNRS) of Strasborg Cedex, France with the support of the Environment\nProgramme of the European Communities to model the spatial\ndistribution of atmospheric-soil CO2 consumption by chemical\nweathering of continental rocks.  The result of the study is the\ndatabase of CO2 consumption and transport of bicarbonate from rivers\nto the ocean in moles per kilometer squared per year (mol km2/yr).\n\nAmiotte Suchet and Probst developed a model that calculates the flux\nof atmospheric-soil CO2 consumed by chemical erosion of continental\nrock (i.e., rock weathering) and the bicarbonate river transfer to the\nocean.  The model is based on a set of empirical relationships between\nFCO2 and the drainage (runoff) on the major rock types outcropping on\nthe continents.  The model assumes that the consumption of atmospheric\nCO2 by continential weathering is primarily influenced by drainage,\nand the different types of rocks outcropping the continents.\n\nThe estimates of flux in the model are the result of four processes:\nthe identification of the empirical relationships between FCO2 and\ndrainage for major rock types;, the development of a model (GEM-CO2)\nto estimate FCO2 and FHCO3-; the validation of GEM-CVO2 using three\ncase studies; and the global application of GEM-CO2.\n\nIn Phase I, rock types used to identify empirical relationships\ninclude: plutonic & metamorphic; sands & snadstones; acid volcanic;\nevaporitic; basalts; shales; and carbonate.\n\nIn Phase III, the GEM-CO2 model results were validated using three\nlarge river basins: the Amazon and Cingo basins in tropical equatorial\nclimates, and the Garonne (France) in temperate climate.\n\nIn Phase IV, the model results were applied to a global grid.  For\neach grid cell, a mean lithology was determined using lithological and\nsoil maps published by the FAO-UNESCO (1971, 1975, 1976, 1978, and\n1981) for each continent.  The drainage intensity was calculated after\nWilmott (1985) using mean monthly precipitation data supplied by NCAR.\n\nThe DB-1012 consists of 4 files: a README file; estimates of CO2 and\nHCO3 flux in a global grid (64,800 cells), an exported ARC/INFO (TM\nVersion 7) map, and a FORTRAN 77 program to read the data.\n\nCDIAC has provided an anonymous FTP area to all data files, retrieval\ncodes, and descriptive files for the DB-1012 dataset.\n\nThe FTP address is\n\n\"ftp://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov\"\n\nand input your email address as the password.\n\nThe DB-1012 data are located in 'ftp://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/pub/db1012'.",
