    "description": "Since the California Gold Rush of 1849, sediment deposition, erosion, and the\nbathymetry of South San Francisco Bay have been altered by both natural\nprocesses and human activities. Historical hydrographic surveys can be used to\nassess how this system has evolved over the past 150 years. The National Ocean\nService (NOS) (formerly the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS),\ncollected five hydrographic surveys of South San Francisco Bay from 1858 to\n1983. Analysis of these surveys enables us to reconstruct the surface of the\nbay floor for each time period and quantify spatial and temporal changes in\ndeposition, erosion, and bathymetry.\n\nThe creation of accurate bathymetric models involves many steps. Sounding data\nwas obtained from the original USCGS and NOS hydrographic sheets and were\nsupplemented with hand drawn depth contours. Shorelines and marsh areas were\nobtained from topographic sheets. The digitized soundings and shorelines were\nentered into a Geographic Information System (GIS), and georeferenced to a\ncommon horizontal datum. Using surface modeling software, bathymetric grids\nwith a horizontal resolution of 50 m were developed for each of the five\nhydrographic surveys. Prior to conducting analyses of sediment deposition and\nerosion, we converted all of the grids to a common vertical datum and made\nadjustments to correct for land subsidence that occurred from 1934 to 1967.\nDeposition and erosion that occurred during consecutive periods was then\ncomputed by differencing the corrected grids. From these maps of deposition and\nerosion, we calculated volumes and rates of net sediment change in the bay. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
