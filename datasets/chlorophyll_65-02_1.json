    "description": "The variation in the phytoplankton biomass over a decadal time scale, and its relationship with the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW) and climate change, has been poorly interpreted because of the limited satellite chlorophylla (chl a) data compared with the physical parameters from satellite.  We analysed a long-term chl a dataset along the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) cruise tracks since 1965 to investigate inter-annual variation of phytoplankton biomass.  In the Southern Ocean, increasing trends of chl a and the spreading of higher chl a area to the north with 3-7 year cycles were found.  Although relationships between the decadal change in chl a and climate change such as variation of sea ice extent and the El Nino are still obscure, large variation of primary production in proportion to the chl a is implied.\n\nThe chl a concentration of sea surface water has been measured routinely on board the icebreakers Fuji and Shirase during almost every cruise of the JARE.\n\nThe download file contains chlorophyll a data collected from ship tracks on JARE voyages between 1965 and 2002.\n\nThe field in this dataset are:\n\nDate (local time)\nYear\nLatitude\nLongitude\nCorrected Chlorophyll a\n\nSee the attached paper for more details.\n\nThe publications on the data collected during the 1965-1976 and 1988-1993 cruises are listed in Fukuchi [1980] and Suzuki and Fukuchi [1997], respectively.  For data on the 1977-1985 and 1994-1997 cruises, see [Kanda and Fukuchi, 1979; Fukuchi and Tamura, 1982; Tanimura, 1981; Watanabe and Nakajima, 1983; Ino and Fukuchi, 1984; Sasaki, 1984; Hamada et al., 1985; Fukuda et al., 1986; Hattori and Fukuchi, 1988; Midorikawa et al., 2000]. Data post 1998-2002 cruises is in Hirawake and Fukuchi [2004].  Data from the 1986-1987 will be published in the JARE data report of digital media, including all cruise data.\n\nAuxiliary Material for paper 2004GL021394 Long-term variation of surface phytoplankton chlorophyll a in the Southern Ocean during 1965-2002.
