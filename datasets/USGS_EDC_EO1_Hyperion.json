    "description": "The Earth-Observing One (EO-1) satellite was decommissioned March 2017. The EO-1 satellite was launched on November 21, 2000 with the NASA's New Millennium Program (NMP). The NMP was an advanced-technology development program created a new generation of technologies and mission concepts into future Earth and space science missions. Information of the EO-1 mission can be found on the EOPortal.\u00a0All EO-1 ALI and Hyperion historical data will continue to be available through\u00a0EarthExplorer\u00a0for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\r\nEO-1 Product Description\r\n\r\nThe Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite was launched November 21, 2000 as a one-year technology demonstration/validation mission. After the initial technology mission was completed, NASA and the USGS agreed to the continuation of the EO-1 program as an Extended Mission. The EO-1 Extended Mission is chartered to collect and distribute Hyperion hyperspectral and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) multispectral products according to customer tasking requests.\r\nHyperion Instrument on board the EO-1 spacecraft\r\n\r\nHyperion\u00a0collects 220 unique spectral channels ranging from 0.357 to 2.576 micrometers with a 10-nm bandwidth. The instrument operates in a pushbroom fashion, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for all bands. The standard scene width is 7.7 kilometers. Standard scene length is 42 kilometers, with an optional increased scene length of 185 kilometers (additional information).\r\n\r\nAll Hyperion and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) data in the archive will be attempted to be processed to the Level 1Gst level of correction. If the scene fails the Level 1Gst processing level, it will be removed from the archive and will become unavailable. As of June 15th, 2009, not all of the EO-1 data has been processed; please continue to check back if the scene of your interest is not available. We will be making attempts to process the failed scene as time and workload permits; however there are no guarantees that all of the EO-1 scenes will be able to be processed.",
