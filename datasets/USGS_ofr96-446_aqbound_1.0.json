    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data sets that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.\n\nThis data set consists of digital aquifer boundaries for the alluvial and\nterrace deposits along the Beaver-North Canadian River from the panhandle to\nCanton Lake in northwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in 830 square miles of the\nQuaternary-age alluvial and terrace aquifer is an important source of water for\nirrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The aquifer\nconsists of poorly sorted, fine to coarse, unconsolidated quartz sand with\nminor amounts of clay, silt, and basal gravel. The hydraulically connected\nalluvial and terrace deposits unconformably overlie the Tertiary-age Ogallala\nFormation and Permian-age formations.\n\nThe aquifer boundaries established in a ground-water flow model for the aquifer\ninclude areas: 1) where the terrace deposits pinch out against relatively\nimpermeable Permian-age formations; 2) where the alluvium has been deposited\nagainst relatively impermeable Permian-age formations; 3) where the alluvial\nand terrace deposits have been eroded and underlying Permian-age formations are\nexposed at the surface; 4) where the aquifer extends beyond the geographic\nlimit of the study area; and 5) where the aquifer has little or no saturated\nthickness.\n\nThe lines in the data set representing aquifer boundaries along geological\ncontacts were extracted from a published digital surficial geology data set\nbased on a scale of 1:250,000. The geographic limits of the aquifer and areas\nof little or no saturated thickness were digitized from a folded paper map, at\na scale of 1:250,000 from a ground-water modeling report.",
