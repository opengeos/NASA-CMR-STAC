    "description": "High-resolution measurements of currents, temperature, salinity and turbidity\nwere made over the course of three months off West Maui in the summer and early\nfall of 2003 to better understand coastal dynamics in coral reef habitats.\nMeasurements were made through the emplacement of a series of bottom-mounted\ninstruments in water depths less than 11 m. The studies were conducted in\nsupport of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology\nProgram's Coral Reef Project. The purpose of these measurements was to collect\nhydrographic data to better constrain the variability in currents and water\ncolumn properties such as water temperature, salinity and turbidity in the\nvicinity of nearshore coral reef systems over the course of a summer and early\nfall when coral larvae spawn. These measurements support the ongoing process\nstudies being conducted under the Coral Reef Project; the ultimate goal is to\nbetter understand the transport mechanisms of sediment, larvae, pollutants and\nother particles in coral reef settings. This report, the third in a series of\nthree, describes data acquisition, processing and analysis. Previous reports\nprovided data and results on: Long-term measurements of currents, temperature,\nsalinity and turbidity off Kahana (PART I), and The spatial structure of\ncurrents, temperature, salinity and suspended sediment along West Maui (PART\nII).\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
