    "description": "This dataset provides distribution data of fungi in Switzerland of the National Data and Information Centre, called  [SwissFungi](https://swissfungi.wsl.ch/en/index.html). SwissFungi is a partner of [InfoSpecies](https://www.infospecies.ch/de/), the network of Swiss data and information centres for [fauna](http://www.cscf.ch/cscf/de/home.html), [flora](https://www.infoflora.ch/en/) and [fungi](https://swissfungi.wsl.ch/en/index.html). One of its main objectives is to document the spatial and temporal distribution of species in Switzerland.    The SwissFungi database currently contains more than 670'000 geo-referenced fungi observations, distributed throughout Switzerland. The oldest observations date back to 1770. A large portion of the records are from the last two decades of the last century to the present day. The database is continuously updated with new fungi records. The data have been validated and originate from national inventories, from research projects, from floristic observations by volunteers as well as from private and public herbaria and from the literature.    The data from the distribution atlas of fungi in Switzerland are available for research and practice (nature conservation projects, environmental impact assessments etc.) and can be obtained via an [application form](https://www.infospecies.ch/de/assets/content/documents/Formular_Datenanfrage20190625.pdf). Please note the tariffs for data requests and submit your request directly to the [InfoSpecies](https://www.infospecies.ch/de/) office. Applications are usually answered within two working weeks. Details on the use of data are regulated in the current guidelines of the national data centers. Please note that the data center SwissFungi is not able to verify all incoming fungal records completely for a correct identification or coordinate errors and therefore cannot guarantee the correctness of the information.    License under [InfoSpecies](https://www.infospecies.ch/de/). Data is free of charge for research projects and available on request.",
