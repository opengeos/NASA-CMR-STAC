    "description": "The daily NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Burned Area (VJ164A1) Version 2 data product is a monthly, global gridded 500-meter (m) product containing per-pixel burned area and quality information. The VJ164 burned area mapping approach employs 750 m VIIRS imagery coupled with 750 m VIIRS active fire observations. The hybrid algorithm applies dynamic thresholds to composite imagery generated from a burn-sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) derived from VIIRS shortwave infrared channels M8 and M11, and a measure of temporal texture. VIIRS bands that are both sensitive and insensitive to biomass burning are used to detect changes caused by fire and to differentiate them from other types of change. The mapping algorithm ultimately identifies the date of burn, to the nearest day, for 500 m grid cells within the individual sinusoidal tile being processed. The date is encoded in a single data layer of the output product as the ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred (range 1\u2013366), with a value of 0 for unburned land pixels and additional values reserved for missing data and water grid cells. The VJ164A1 data product is designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua combined burned area product to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. \r\n\r\nVJ164A1 has been released on a limited basis due to concerns over the quality of the data along the edges of inland water bodies and at high latitudes. These regions contain grid cells falsely identified as burned as a result of coarse resolution inputs to the cloud mask used in the generation of the 750 m VIIRS active fire observations. Users are urged to exercise caution when using this provisional (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/NPP_QA/NPPpage.cgi?fileName=maturity&subdir=forPage) data in research. The Version 2 burned area product generated with an improved cloud mask is scheduled for release in the summer of 2020.\r\n\r\nThe data layers provided in the VJ164A1 product include Burn Date, Burn Date Uncertainty, and Quality Assurance (QA), along with First Day and Last Day of reliable change detection of the year. A low resolution browse is also provided showing the burned date layer with a color map applied in JPEG format.\r\n\r\nNotification:  VIIRS/NPP Burned Area Monthly L4 Global 500 m SIN Grid data product has been released on a limited basis due to falsely identified burned areas.\r\n\r\n",
