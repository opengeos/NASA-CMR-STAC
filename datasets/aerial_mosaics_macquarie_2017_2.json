    "description": "One vertical and two oblique mosaics of The Isthmus at Macquarie Island were created from aerial photographs taken with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) during the course of Australian Antarctic Science Project 4340 in January and February 2017. The oblique mosaics include Wireless Hill and the northern end of the island's plateau. One oblique mosaic is a view from the eastern side of The Isthmus and the other is a view from the western side of The Isthmus. \nThe photographs were taken by Murray Hamilton of the University of Adelaide using a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced UAV (under Monash University's Operators Certificate) which he was using to make temperature and humidity observations. They were taken when the UAV was waiting to descend and measure a temperature profile. The measuring instrument needed some time for the temperature to equilibrate after a rapid ascent. The photographs were taken by rotating the craft, taking snapshots every few tens of degrees.\nHugin software was used to create the mosaics.\nThe photographs for the vertical mosaic were taken on 15 January 2017 and the photographs for the oblique mosaics were taken on 7 February 2017 (view from east) and 15 February 2017 (view from west).\nThe vertical mosaic was produced at the request of the Building Services Supervisor at the station.",
