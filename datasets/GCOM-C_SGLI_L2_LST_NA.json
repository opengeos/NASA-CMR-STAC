    "description": "GCOM-C/SGLI L2 Land surface temperature dataset is obtained from the SGLI sensor onboard GCOM-C and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GCOM-C is Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent Orbit sattelite launched on December 23, 2017, which mounts SGLI and conducts long-term global observations of geophysical variables related to the global climate system across 28 items including aerosol and vegetation over 4 areas of atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere. The data will be used to contribute to higher accuracy of global warming prediction. The SGLI has swath of 1150 km in the visible band and 1400 km in the infrared band. Level 2 products are defined to be products composed of physical quantity data that is calculated based on Level 1B products and meteorological data, as well as various additional data related to the physical quantity data.This dataset includes Land Surface Emissivity at TI01 (E01), Land Surface Emissivity at TI02 (E02), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and quality flag (QA_flag). E01 is land surface emissivity at TI01 estimated using the geometric corrected TOA radiance data as input. The physical quantiy unit is None. E02 is land surface emissivity at TI02 estimated using the geometric corrected TOA radiance data as input. The physical quantiy unit is None. LST is the temperature of terrestrial land surface estimated using the geometric corrected TOA radiance data as input by semi-analytical approach based on the radiative transfer simulation at two thermal infrared bands and the Split-Window method. The physical quantiy units is Kelvin.The QA_flag shows flag of quality and observation condition.The provided format is HDF5. The spatial resolution is 250m. The projection method is EQA. The generation unit is Tile. The current version of the product is Version 3. The Version 2 is also available, but please note that the \"QA_Flag\" data has been changed.",
