    "description": "Field evaluations of existing habitat suitability index (HSI) models\nfor spawning adults, eggs, and larvae of American shad (Alosa\nsapidissima) were conducted in 1990-1992; initial models for juveniles\nin nursery habitats were developed.  Fish abundance in various\nhabitats of the upper Delaware River was quantified by (1) observation\nof adult spawning activity, (2) collection of eggs and larvae with\nmetered plankton and drift nets, and (3) enumeration of juveniles by\nunderwater observation and seining techniques.  Regression analysis,\nprincipal component analysis, and range analysis were used to relate\nabundance to an array of physical habitat variables potentially\ninfluencing fish distributions.\n\nNo HSI model was previously developed for juvenile American shad in\nriverine habitats.  Four physical habitat variables were correlated\nwith juvenile abundance: water temperature, dissolved oxygen\n(covariates), river depth, and turbidity.  Regression analysis,\nprincipal component analysis, and range analysis were used to relate\nabundance to an array of physical habitat variables potentially\ninfluencing fish distributions.\n\n\nThe Research and Development Laboratory-Wellsboro (RDL-W) is located\non 55 acres near Wellsboro, Pennsylvania (Tioga County). Laboratory\nfacilities include 3 modern buildings, 8x200-foot concrete raceways, 3\nproduction wells, and support equipment.\n\nCore Capabilities\n\nThe RDL-W conducts research for restoration of depleted fisheries and\nother aquatic biological resources. A diversified research program in\necology, conservation technology, genetics, and physiology emphases\nthe integration of laboratory and field studies to develop\nscientifically sound approaches to the management of aquatic\necosystems. Research is directed primarily towards development of\ninformation and technology to increase understanding of aquatic\necosystems in the northeastern United States and to assist client\nagencies to better manage these ecosystems and their biota. Technical\nassistance is provided to clients throughout the nation.",
