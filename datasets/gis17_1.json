    "description": "The Australian Antarctic Data Centre's Casey Station GIS data were originally mapped from Aerial photography (January 4 1994). Refer to the metadata record 'Casey Station GIS Dataset'. Since then various features have been added to these data as structures have been removed, moved or established. Some of these features have been surveyed. These surveys have metadata records from which the report describing the survey can be downloaded. \nHowever, the locations of other features have been obtained from a variety of sources. \nThe data are included in the data available for download from the provided URLs. \nThe data conforms to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See the provided URL. \nData described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 17. \nEach feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets and quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature.",
