    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 227\n      Photosynthetic Response of Antarctic and Subantarctic Plants to Light and UV Stress in Undisturbed/Disturbed Habitats including Recommendation for the Promotion of Recolonisation of Damaged Sites. See the link below for public details on this project.\n\nFrom the abstract of the referenced paper:\n\nVegetation downwind of a concrete batching platform at Casey, East Antarctica, has been severely contaminated by cement dust. This paper draws attention to the resilience of the byrophyte Ceratodon compared to lichens in the area.  Plant and soil samples collected along a 90 m transect passing directly through the most damaged area and running parallel to the predominantly strong easterly winds indicate a strong positive correlation between chlorophyll and carotenoid concentration and high soil pH.  The results suggest that elevated pigment levels in plants close to the batching platform are due to enhanced thylakoid production rather than a disproportionate loss of dry matter.  Variable (Fv/Fm) fluorescence measurements and growth cabinet experiments indicate that Ceratodon from even the most heavily contaminated sites is photosynthetically competent and capable of rapid growth under favourable conditions.",
