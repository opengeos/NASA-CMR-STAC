    "description": "Landfast sea ice (also known as fast ice) is sea ice which is mechanically fastened against the coast and/or grounded icebergs. Its extent is highly variable on a range of time-scales, but it tends to recur in certain locations based upon the location of grounded icebergs. In Antarctica, it tends to form between the coast and the ~400 m isobath (which approximately defines the depth in which icebergs can ground).\nThis dataset (in NetCDF format) contains a time series of 336 consecutive 15-day 'composite' images of landfast sea ice extent along the Mawson Coast to Cape Darnley, East Antarctica. The data period is from March 2000 (when Terra MODIS was commissioned) to March 2014, i.e., a span of 14 years. Fast ice data were retrieved from MODIS satellite imagery, based on a semi-automated fast ice edge retrieval algorithm.\nAlso included in the NetCDF file are projection parameters, latitude/longitude arrays and timestamps.",
