    "description": "The MYD11A1.041 dataset was decommissioned as of March 1, 2018. Users are encouraged to use Version 6 of MODIS/Aqua Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid SIN (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11a1.006). \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua version-041 (V41) products use a modified version-4 (V4) LST algorithm and version-5 (V5) data inputs. The V41 products primarily address underestimation problems in the V5 Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) products. Recent validation activities reveal that the V5 CMG products underestimate LSTs up to 6K especially in desert and semi-arid regions. The production date for this collection starts from MODIS/Aqua data acquisition date 2007-001. This beginning date is driven by the availability of the MODIS V5 data inputs (level-1B radiance data, geolocation data, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, and land and snow cover data).\r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua V41 LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 Km Grid (Short name: MYD11A1) products incorporate 1-km pixels, which are produced daily using the generalized split-window LST algorithm. This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of atmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into tractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in bands 31 and 32 are estimated from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe V41 Aqua/MYD11A1 products are projected in a Sinusoidal grid by mapping the level-2 LST product (MYD11_L2) on 1-kilometer (precisely 0.928-km) grids. The MYD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and bands 31 and 32 emissivities from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe V41 MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11A1, are validated to Stage-1. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/background.html\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications. Subsequent and improved versions of this product also exist.\r\n\r\nThe V41 MYD11A1 product\u2019s acquisition range started January 1, 2007 (2007-001) and  continued through March 30, 2017. The V41 LST products from 2007-001 will remain consistent with similar products from V4, and hence are amenable to combine them in a time series analysis. Users should exercise caution, and not mix the V4.x (i.e., V4 and V41) and V5 LST products in their analysis.\r\n\r\nV041 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: 24 MB \r\nResolution: ~1 kilometer (actual: 0.93km) \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 12",
