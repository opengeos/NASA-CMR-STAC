    "description": "The exclusive fishing zone or fishery zone refers to an area beyond the outer limit of the territorial sea (12 nautical miles from the coast) in which the coastal State has the right to fish, subject to any concessions which may be granted to foreign fishermen. Some countries have made no claim beyond the territorial sea. Some States have claimed an exclusive fishing zone instead of the more encompassing 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is an international agreement that sets conditions and limits on the use and exploitation of the oceans. This Convention also sets the rules for the maritime jurisdictional boundaries of the different member states.  The UNCLOS was opened for signature on 10 December 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica, and it entered into force on 16 November 1994. As of January 2000, there are 132 countries that have ratified UNCLOS.  Under UNCLOS, coastal States can claim sovereign rights in a 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This allows for sovereign rights over the EEZ in terms of exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of all natural resources in the seabed, its subsoil, and overlaying waters. UNCLOS allows other states to navigate and fly over the EEZ, as well as to lay submarine cables and pipelines. The inner limit of the EEZ starts at the outer boundary of the Territorial Sea (i.e., 12 nautical miles from the low-water line along the coast).  Some States have not ratified UNCLOS and many have not yet claimed their EEZ.  Given the uncertainties surrounding much of the delimitation of the fishing zones, these figures should be used with caution.
