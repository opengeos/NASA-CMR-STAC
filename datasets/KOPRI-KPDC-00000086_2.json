    "description": "In order to investigate the structure of phytoplankton communities, this study was carried out at 20 stations from September 2 to 30, 2009 in the Bering strait, Chukchi Sea and Canadian Basin. Phytoplankton communities were composed of 59 taxa representing Dinophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Dictyochophyceae, rasinophyceae, Prymneosiophyceae and unidentified phytoplankton(< 20\u339b) in the study area. Phytoplankton standing crops ranged from minimum 5.27\u00d7105cells \u2113-1 at station LS3 to maximum 7.82\u00d7106cells \u2113-1 at station BS2 in the study area. The most abundant species was nano-pico sized phytoplankton in almost station, but the second was variable. Phytoplankton dominant species were Thalassiosira sp., Chaetoceros sp. and nano-picophytoplankton such as Dinobryon belgica and Cryptomonas sp.. From Bering strait to Canadian Basin, the biomass was more lower along latitude to the arctic.\r\n1) To investigate on species composition, abundance and dominant species of phytoplankton communities in Chukchi Sea and Canadian Basin\r\n2) To study on taxonomic research and dominant species of phytoplankton communities for investigate on indicator species",
