    "description": "Introduction\n\nThis group of maps shows relative susceptibility of hill slopes to the\ninitiation sites of rainfall-triggered soil slip-debris flows in southwestern\nCalifornia. As such, the maps offer a partial answer to one part of the three\nparts necessary to predict the soil-slip/debris-flow process. A complete\nprediction of the process would include assessments of \"where\", \"when\", and\n\"how big\". These maps empirically show part of the \"where\" of prediction (i.e.,\nrelative susceptibility to sites of initiation of the soil slips) but do not\nattempt to show the extent of run out of the resultant debris flows. Some\ninformation pertinent to \"when\" the process might begin is developed. \"When\" is\ndetermined mostly by dynamic factors such as rainfall rate and duration, for\nwhich local variations are not amenable to long-term prediction. \"When\"\ninformation is not provided on the maps but is described later in this\nnarrative. The prediction of \"how big\" is addressed indirectly by restricting\nthe maps to a single type of landslide process soil slip-debris flows.\n\nThe susceptibility maps were created through an iterative process from two\nkinds of information. First, locations of sites of past soil slips were\nobtained from inventory maps of past events. Aerial photographs, taken during\nsix rainy seasons that produced abundant soil slips, were used as the basis for\nsoil slip-debris flow inventory. Second, digital elevation models (DEM) of the\nareas that were inventoried were used to analyze the spatial characteristics of\nsoil slip locations. These data were supplemented by observations made on the\nground. Certain physical attributes of the locations of the soil-slip debris\nflows were found to be important and others were not. The most important\nattribute was the mapped bedrock formation at the site of initiation of the\nsoil slip. However, because the soil slips occur in surficial materials\noverlying the bedrocks units, the bedrock formation can only serve as a\nsurrogate for the susceptibility of the overlying surficial materials.\n\nThe maps of susceptibility were created from those physical attributes learned\nto be important from the inventories. The multiple inventories allow a model to\nbe created from one set of inventory data and evaluated with others. The\nresultant maps of relative susceptibility represent the best estimate generated\nfrom available inventory and DEM data.\n\nSlope and aspect values used in the susceptibility analysis were 10-meter DEM\ncells at a scale of 1:24,000. For most of the area 10-meter DEMs were\navailable; for those quadrangles that have only 30-meter DEMs, the 30-meter\nDEMS were resampled to 10-meters to maintain resolution of 10-meter cells.\nGeologic unit values used in the susceptibility analysis were five-meter cells.\nFor convenience, the soil slip susceptibility values are assembled on\n1:100,000-scale bases. Any area of the 1:100,000-scale maps can be transferred\nto 1:24,000-scale base without any loss of accuracy. Figure 32 is an example of\npart of a 1:100,000-scale susceptibility map transferred back to a\n1:24,000-scale quadrangle.",
