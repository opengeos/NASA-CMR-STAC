    "description": "\nAn ecotoxicological risk assessment of groundwater from two Macquarie Island fuel spill sites was conducted to assess the level of risk posed by the sites to the adjacent marine receiving environment. Experiments were conducted on Macquarie Island during the summer season of 2017/18. \n\nThe two fuel spill sites (known as: Fuel Farm and Power House, see file: Map-macquarie_building_and_structures_14676.pdf) within the vicinity of the Macquarie Island research station had undergone intensive in situ remediation by the Australian Antarctic Division over the previous decade. Despite remediation efforts, groundwater leaching from the sites continued to contain some residual fuel contamination, with sheen observed at several shoreline seeps and chemical analysis of groundwater samples confirmed some hydrocarbon contamination remained. This study aimed to assess the level of residual risk posed by groundwater from these sites as it enters the adjacent marine environment.\n\nWe ran a series of toxicity tests using composited samples of salinity-adjusted groundwater discharge, as an exposure medium to test the sensitivity of 11 locally collected marine invertebrate species to the groundwater. \n\nGroundwater sampling was conducted over two periods: 23-29/11/17 and 18-20/12/17, for use in two rounds of toxicity testing (referred to as test round 1 (A and B) and test round 2). Groundwater samples were collected from 22 groundwater monitoring points; 12 surface seeps and 7 previously installed piezometers. These monitoring points were located along the coastal margin of the of the fuel spill sites, at their boundary with the adjacent marine environment (see: Locations-Fuel Farm-groundwater monitoring.pdf and Locations-Powerhouse-groundwater monitoring.pdf). The 22 groundwater samples were used to prepare seven salinity-adjusted composite test solutions (TS), each composed of equal volumes of up to nine groundwater samples. Salinity adjustment was to approximately that of ambient seawater (34 ppt), using hypersaline brine (prepared from locally collected clean seawater, which was frozen, then partially defrosted to collect concentrated brine). A total of approximately 6 L of was prepared for each of the seven TSs. See file: MI Ecotox-2017-18_TestSolutions_v03.xlsx for TS details (including: collection, preparation and physicochemical analysis results).\n\nEleven locally collected marine invertebrate species were used in the tests. Biota were collected from two sites on Macquarie Island, both within the vicinity of the research station but away from areas of known fuel contamination: 1). Garden Bay on the East Coast (54\u00b0 29' 56.9\" S, 158\u00b0 56' 28.8\" E) and 2). Hasselborough Bay on the West Coast (54\u00b0 29' 45.6\" S, 158\u00b0 55' 55.8\" E). See: Map-macquarie_building_and_structures_14676.pdf. Dates of collection of test biota were 1/12/2017 (for test round 1A), 6/12/2017 (for test round 1B) and 20 and 22/12/17 (for test round 2). The 11 test taxa were from six broad taxonomic groups: 2 amphipods (Paramoera sp., Parawaldeckia kidderi), 2 flatworms (Obrimoposthia wandeli, Obrimoposthia ohlini), 2 copepods (Tigriopus angulatus, Harpacticus sp.), 2 gastropods (Laevilitorina caliginosa, Macquariella hamiltoni), 2 bivalves (Gaimardia trapesina, Lasaea hinemoa) and 1 isopod (Exosphaeroma gigas).\n\nTest biota were observed for 14 or 21 days and survival observed periodically. Full details of toxicity test conditions are provided in the file: MI Ecotox-2017-18_RawTestObs v02.xlsx (worksheets: TestSummary, Species and Endpoints). This file also contains, on subsequent worksheets, the raw toxicity test observations for each text taxa. These raw result data are compiled in the file: MI Ecotox-2017-18_Test-DATA.xlsx, worksheet: Survival-ALL contains survival data for all tests and taxa. Subsequent worksheets provide data for each test taxa separately and also include any sublethal observations that were made.
