    "description": "This proposal identifies work elements that are logical extensions, and which build off, our previous work. Our overall scientific objective is to provide a complete understanding of the external factors (such as atmospheric mercury and sulfate runoff loads) and internal factors (such as hydroperiod maintenance and water chemistry) that result in the formation and bioaccumulation of MeHg in south Florida ecosystems, and to conduct this research is such a way that it will be directly useable by land and water resource managers. More specifically, we will seek to achieve the following subobjectives (1) Extend our mesocosms studies to provide a more omprehensive examination of the newly discovered 'new versus old' mercury effect by conducting studies under differing hydrologic conditions and sub-ecosystem settings so that our experimental results will be more generally applicable to the greater south Florida ecosystem including the STA\u2019s that have been recently constructed and are yielding very high levels of methylmercury but the cause is currently unknown; (2) Seek to further identify the mechanisms that result in extremely high levels of MeHg after natural drying and rewetting cycles in the Everglades and which have major implications for the Restoration Plan; (3) Further our studies on the production of methylmercury in south Florida estuaries and tidal marshes by conducting mass-balance studies of tidal marshes; (4) Begin to partner with wildlife toxicologists funded by the State of Florida to unravel the complexities surrounding methylmercury exposure and effects to higher order wildlife in south Florida; and , (5) Continue to participate with mercury ecosystem modelers who are funded by the State of Florida and the USEPA to evaluate the overall ecological effects of reducing mercury emissions and the risks associated with methylmercury exposure.",
