    "description": "This resource is known as Bird Checklists of the United States.  Bird\nChecklists of the United States. For years, people and groups have developed\nlistings or checklists of birds that occur in a particular region. Information\non the distribution or seasonal occurrence of birds in an area, however, can\nchange over time. Bird checklists often are outdated in only a few years after\nprinting, but budget and time constraints prohibit regular updates.  The\nInternet provides new opportunities for the compilation and dissemination of\ncurrent information on bird distribution. Here we offer bird checklists\ndeveloped by others that indicate the seasonal occurrence of birds in state,\nfederal, and private management areas, nature preserves, and other areas of\nspecial interest in the United States.\n\nBird checklists exist for Great Plains States: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas,\nMinnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,\nSouth Dakota, Texas, Wyoming; East of Great Plains states: Alabama, Arkansas,\nConnecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,\nLouisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New\nHampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode\nIsland, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin;\nand West of Great Plains: Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah,\nWashington.\n\nIt is hoped that these checklists will serve several purposes. First, we hope\nthe checklists will help bird enthusiasts decide where to visit. A visit to\nthese unique areas can be a rewarding experience for both the amateur and\nexpert birdwatcher. Second, we hope that these checklists will provide\npotential visitors with a guide to birds that might occur in a region during a\nparticular season. The checklists were kept simple to facilitate printing so\nthey can be easily carried into the field. And third, we hope that these\nchecklists will stimulate and encourage visitors to these areas to help improve\nthe accuracy and completeness of the checklists. The information in some\nchecklists already has been updated; these checklists contain more current\ninformation than the printed versions.\n\nSightings of birds and other wildlife are an important part of monitoring\nwildlife use. Visitors are encouraged to share their observations of rare,\naberrant, or occasional birds with the staff at these areas. With each\nchecklist, we have included an address for visitors to send information on rare\nbirds so that checklists can be updated. To assist in establishing standards in\nobservation and reporting, we also provide a Record Documentation Form to\ndocument supporting details of rare bird observations.\n\nThe efforts and dedication of the many birders, birding groups, biologists, and\nresource managers who developed these checklists are acknowledged.\n\nThe information for this metadata was partially taken from the\nNorthern Prairie Wildlife Research Center website at\nhttp://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/chekbird/index.htm",
