    "description": "NARSTO_EPA_SS_LOS_ANGELES_AETHALOMETER_EC_DATA is the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Supersite (SS) Los Angeles Aethalometer Elemental Carbon Data. Data was collected between September 2000 to October 2003 at Claremont, Downey, Riverside, Rubidoux, and the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles County, California. The Magee Scientific AE-2 series dual beam aethalometer was used in a mobile trailer to collect mass concentrations of optically absorbing black carbon particles in the submicron size range during September 15, 2000 to October 16, 2003. The Aethalometer collected aerosol continuously on quartz fiber paper and determined the increment of optically absorbing black carbon per unit volume of sampled air every 5 minutes. The overall objective of the Los Angeles Supersite in Southern California Particle Center and Supersite (SCPCS) was to conduct monitoring and research that contributes to a better understanding of the measurement, sources, size distribution, chemical composition and physical state, spatial and temporal variability, and linkages to health effects of airborne particulate matter in the Los Angeles Basin (LAB ). The EPA Particulate Matter (PM) Supersites Program was an ambient air monitoring research program designed to provide information of value to the atmospheric sciences, and human health and exposure research communities. \r\n\r\nEight geographically diverse projects were chosen to specifically address these EPA research priorities: (1) to characterize PM, its constituents, precursors, co-pollutants, atmospheric transport, and its source categories that affect the PM in any region; (2) to address the research questions and scientific uncertainties about PM source-receptor and exposure-health effects relationships; and (3) to compare and evaluate different methods of characterizing PM including testing new and emerging measurement methods.\r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
