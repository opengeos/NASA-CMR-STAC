    "description": "These photos consist of 581 scanned 35mm colour slides (each approximately 2.2 MB) taken on Heard Island by Dr Jenny Scott (JJS) between December 1986 and February 2004.  Areas covered are Gilchrist Beach in the northeast, to Spit Bay in the east, to Long Beach in the south, to Cape Gazert in the west, to Atlas Cove and Laurens Peninsula in the northwest. An equivalent set of 35mm photos for the remaining areas along the north coast is included in metadata record HI_VEG_NON_ORTHO_VEGMAP. Photos are either oblique aerial (taken from helicopter), terrestrial or ship-based.  Although they were taken specifically to use for interpretation when finalising the vegetation mapping (HI_VEG_ORTHO_VEGMAP), they can also be useful for fieldwork planning of any sort, as they give an overview of terrain and topography covering most of the coastal and near-coastal areas of the island.\n\nShapefile - photo locations\nOne shapefile shows the approximate location and direction of the camera for each image.  The location pointers were digitised as vectors with the start of the line being the approximate location of the camera and the end of the line providing the direction (hint: convert to arrows for ease of reference). Attributes include image name and file source, location, date of capture, where photo was taken from (aerial, ground, ship offshore), ID of original JJS slide, and comments (re quality of image, whether location approximate, etc).",
