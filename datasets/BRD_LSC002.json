    "description": "Two years of field work have been completed in the development of an\nindex of biotic integrity (IBI) for fish communities in the\nmiddle-to-upper Delaware River basin (Delaware Water Gap to Callicoon,\nNew York).  Fish were collected in riffles and pools on 200 m segments\nof eight tributaries.  Collections were made concurrently in the\nDelaware River mainstem within 0.5 mile (downstream) of the same\ntributary mouths, in three habitat types: riffles, deep pools, and\ninshore submerged vegetation zones.  Quality control on species\nidentity, as well as length/weight/disease determination, has been\ncompleted on all specimens.  A total of 15,673 fish were collected\n(7,655 in tributaries and 8,018 in mainstem habitats) representing 44\nspecies (36 in tributaries and 36 in mainstem habitats).\n\nFish community data (species richness, trophic composition, and\npopulation/health data) will be related to both water quality and land\nuse data to develop IBIs.  Water quality data, including a dozen or\nmore physical, chemical, and biological parameters taken during the\nsame seasons/years by Delaware River Basin Commission personnel, are\ncurrently being indexed for use in the models.  Land use data in four\ncategories (22 subcategories), obtained from the Anderson Level 2\ndatabase using GIS techniques, have been summarized for use in the\nmodels.  Current work involves examination of the variance associated\nwith traditional fish metrics and the identification of alternative\nmetrics that may better explain the covariance with water quality and\nland use.\n\nThe Research and Development Laboratory-Wellsboro (RDL-W) is located\non 55 acres near Wellsboro, Pennsylvania (Tioga County). Laboratory\nfacilities include 3 modern buildings, 8x200-foot concrete raceways, 3\nproduction wells, and support equipment.\n\nThe RDL-W conducts research for restoration of depleted fisheries and\nother aquatic biological resources. A diversified research program in\necology, conservation technology, genetics, and physiology emphases\nthe integration of laboratory and field studies to develop\nscientifically sound approaches to the management of aquatic\necosystems. Research is directed primarily towards development of\ninformation and technology to increase understanding of aquatic\necosystems in the northeastern United States and to assist client\nagencies to better manage these ecosystems and their biota. Technical\nassistance is provided to clients throughout the nation.",
