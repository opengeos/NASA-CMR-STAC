    "description": "The original aims of this project were:\n\nTo obtain publication standard line drawings of all stages of the thirty three species of Pterygote insect and spider which occur on Macquarie Island to illustrate the text of a comprehensive publication on the fauna which includes keys and biological information on each species.\n\nThe research that was carried out was:\n\nSpecimens of invertebrates which had been collected in previous years from Macquarie Island were selected from the collection in the Australian National Insect Collection for illustration.  The artist, Karina McInnes spent two months at the University of Queensland's Department of Entomology drawing both whole animals and key characters for all the species under the supervision of R. van Klinken.  Sixty four drawings of a very high quality were completed. All species of insect, terrestrial Crustacea and spider on the island were illustrated to a highly professional publishable standard.  Because the artist worked faster than anticipated, more drawings were able to be completed than planned.\n\nFrom the Summary of the referenced book:\n\nSubantarctic Macquarie Island, lying nearly 1500km south-south-east of Tasmania, is uniformly cool, wet and windy.  Its isolation means both the flora and fauna are depauperate in species and disjunct in composition.   However, the invertebrate fauna is relatively well studied compared to other areas of Australia of similar size.  In this book, I summarise the biological information available on the terrestrial and fresh water invertebrates that reside there, and provide illustrated keys to identify many of the species.\n\nAltogether there are over 350 terrestrial, fresh and brackish water species recorded from the island but a few are not residents.  Of the permanent residents, approximately 12% are considered endemic and 25% are cosmopolitan in distribution.  A number of transient, synanthropic and species of unknown status are known.  Insects are in a minority with only 20 native resident species while the most diverse taxon is the Acarina (mites) with nearly 120 species.  An approximately equal number of species have affinities with faunas of New Zealand and its cool temperate islands (10%) to the northeast or with subantarctic islands to the west (11%) but the highest number of species are of unknown distribution as they have not yet been described (30%).  The remainder are varied in origin.\n\nCopies of the illustrations and the book are available for download at the provided URLs.",
