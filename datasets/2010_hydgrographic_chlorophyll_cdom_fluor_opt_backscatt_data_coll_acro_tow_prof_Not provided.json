    "description": "This data set contains the Acrobat files from data underway along transects conducted near Barrow, AK from August 21  - September 8, 2010.  Details of the latitude, longitude, date, and time are listed in the event log that is archived at this site.  Date /time (UTC day, decimal time), time, position, bottom depth, and measured variables are listed as separate columns in each file.  Each Acrobat file is named according to the transect line sampled, the year, and the year day of data collection (e.g., line_2_2010_233.dat).  Because of a leaky motor can, data could not be collected from all transects sampled during the AON work using the Acrobat.    Data were collected from the R/V Annika Marie using an Acrobat (Sea Sciences Inc.) towed undulating vehicle equipped with a SeaBird SBE49 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor, a Wetlabs EcoTriplet with chlorophyll and CDOM fluorescence and optical backscatter sensors, and a Wetlabs data logger system.  Data were acquired in real time from near-surface (1-m) to a few meters off of the bottom or to a maximum depth of 60 m.  The inter-profile distance was usually ~150 m over the shelf and ~1 km seaward of the shelf break.  The CTD was calibrated pre-cruise.  No correction of chlorophyll fluorescence was done as comparison with the extracted chlorophyll from accompanying Niskin bottle samples indicated that the factory calibration was very good.  The WetLabs software that calculates density from the observed temperature and conductivity cannot do so at temperatures below 0\u00b0C and a value of -999.999 is returned.  Therefore users of these data should re-calculate density.   Units of chlorophyll and CDOM are \u00b5g/L.  For optical backscattering, the particulate volume scattering coefficient at 117 degrees and 660 nm with the scattering of water at 117 degrees subtracted out is shown.",
