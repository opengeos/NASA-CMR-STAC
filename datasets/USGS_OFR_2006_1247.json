    "description": "This report consists of high-resolution chirp seismic reflection profiledata\nfrom the northern Gulf of Lions, Spain. These data were acquired in2004 using\nthe Research Vessel Oceanus (USGS Cruise ID: O-1-04-MS). Thedata are available\nin binary and JPEG image formats. Binary data arein Society of Exploration\nGeologists (SEG) SEG-Y format and may bedownloaded for further processing or\ndisplay. Reference maps andJPEG images of the profiles may be viewed with your\nWeb browser.\n\nMarine seismic reflection data are used to image and mapsedimentary and\nstructural features of the seafloor and subsurface.These data were acquired\nacross the shelf and canyon area of the Gulfof Lions, Spain as part of a\nmultinational effort to characterize thegeologic framework and sedimentary\nenvironment of the region.The specific objective of this seismic survey is to\nprovide seismicreflection images of the depositional geometry of the upper 50\nmeters ofsubbottom stratigraphy in order to better understand the mechanisms\nofsediment transport and deposition. These chirp seismic profiles\nprovidehigh-quality images with approximately 20 cm of verticalresolution and\nup to 80 m of subbottom penetration.\n\nChirp seismic reflection profiles are acquired by means of anacoustic source\nand a hydrophone array, both contained in a single unittowed in the water\nbehind a survey vessel. The sound source emits ashort (30 ms) swept-frequency\n(500 to 7200 Hz)acoustic pulse,which propagates through the water and sediment\ncolumns. The acousticenergy is reflected at density boundaries (such as the\nseafloor orsediment layers beneath the seafloor), and detected by the\nhydrophonearray, and digitally recorded by the onboard PC-based acquisition\nsystem.As the vessel moves, this process is repeated multiple times per\nsecond,producing a two-dimensional image of the shallow geologic\nstructurebeneath the ship track.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
