    "description": "We completed a field season in Antarctica in 2010-11 with a 5-person field party. Ten sampling sites along the Transantarctic Mountains from the Convoy Range to Hatcher Bluffs were visited by helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft, where rock samples were collected. All samples were returned to the University of Minnesota-Duluth, where they were prepared for laboratory study. Laboratory work includes examination of polished thin sections by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope to determine textures, mineral assemblages, and mineral compositions. Samples of igneous and metamorphic rock clasts were crushed in order to isolate the mineral zircon; zircon from these samples was analyzed by U-Pb, O and Hf isotopic analysis in order to determine their ages and isotopic character. Monazite was identified in selected samples for U-Pb age dating in polished thin section. A suite of Ross Orogen granitoids was also prepared for zircon separation and for whole-rock geochemical analysis.\n\nPetrographic study is complete for over 300 samples of igneous and metamorphic rock clasts collected from glacial moraines on the \u2018backside\u2019 of the Transantarctic Mountains, mainly between the inlets to the Byrd through Shackleton Glaciers. We U-Pb, O and Hf analyses of zircon and monazite in igneous and metamorphic clasts, and in samples of TAM granitoids.",
