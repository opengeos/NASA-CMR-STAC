    "description": "Background to Measurements\nThe figures provided here are derived from the associated GIS spatial layers from AAS4565 of the medium and heavy disturbance footprint surrounding Casey Research Station at the years 2002, 2008, 2015 and 2018. The footprint mapping used a consistent methodology for digitisation for the years 2002, 2015, and 2018, whereas the year 2008 included ground-truther field measurements. Some variation in the footprint is due to snow cover hiding areas of disturbance. The sources and date of the data used is as follows:\n\u2022\t2018 Casey Heavy Disturbance \u2013 digitised by S. Brooks from Worldview-3 imagery, captured 27/1/2018.\n\u2022\t2018 Casey Medium Disturbance \u2013 digitised by S. Brooks from Worldview-3 imagery, captured 27/1/2018.\n\u2022\t2015 Casey Heavy Disturbance \u2013 digitised by S. Brooks from AAS 5024 UAV-imagery.\n\u2022\t2015 Casey Medium Disturbance \u2013 digitised by S.
