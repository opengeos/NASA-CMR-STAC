    "description": "Refer to antFOCE report section 2.3 for deployment, sampling and analysis details.\n\nhttps://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/AAS_4127_antFOCE_Project4127\n\nThe download file contains an Excel workbook with a series of data spreadsheets - one for each of the Onset Hoboware Tidbit  v2 (UTBI-001) temperature loggers that were attached to the outside of various pieces of the underwater experimental infrastructure across the antFOCE site. A Notes spreadsheet is also included with information relevant to the data.  \n\nBackground \n\nThe antFOCE experimental system was deployed in O'Brien Bay, approximately 5 kilometres south of Casey station, East Antarctica, in the austral summer of 2014/15. Surface and sub-surface (in water below the sea ice) infrastructure allowed controlled manipulation of seawater pH levels (reduced by 0.4 pH units below ambient) in 2 chambers placed on the sea floor over natural benthic communities. Two control chambers (no pH manipulation) and two open plots (no chambers, no pH manipulation) were also sampled to compare to the pH manipulated (acidified) treatment chambers.  \n\nDetails of the antFOCE experiment can be found in the report \u2013 \"antFOCE 2014/15 \u2013 Experimental System, Deployment, Sampling and Analysis\". This report and a diagram indicating how the various antFOCE data sets relate to each other are available at:\n\nhttps://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/AAS_4127_antFOCE_Project4127\n",
