    "description": "WELDAKWK.015 was decommissioned on December 2, 2019. Users are encouraged to use the improved monthly Global Web-Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) Version 3, 3.1, and 3.2 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GWELD/GWELDMO.003, https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GWELD/GWELDMO.031, and https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GWELD/GWELDMO.032).\n\nNASA\u2019s Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) are generated from composited 30 meter (m) Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) mosaics of the United States and Alaska from 2003 to 2012. These mosaics provide consistent data to derive land cover, geophysical, and biophysical products for regional assessments of surface dynamics for effective study of Earth system function. This product includes Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance and Brightness Temperature, along with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) generated from Band 3 and Band 4 TOA Reflectance. WELDAKWK is distributed in Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4).\n\nThe WELD weekly products are defined with respect to each calendar year and as consecutive 7 day products with the following examples defined for the weeks:\n\tWeek01: January 1 to January 7\n\tWeek02: January 8 to January 14\n\tWeek52: December 24 to December 30 (non-leap years)\n\tWeek52: December 23 to December 29 (leap years)\n\tWeek53: December 31 (non-leap years)\n\tWeek53: December 30 to December 31 (leap years) \n\nThe WELD project is funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and is a collaboration between the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center and the South Dakota State University (SDSU) Geospatial Sciences Center of Excellence (GSCE). \n\nKnown Issues\n\n* WELD Version 1.5 known issues can be found in the WELD Version 1.5 User Guide.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Version\n\n* Version 1.5 is the original version.",
