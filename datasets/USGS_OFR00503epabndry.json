    "description": "The purpose of this project is to map the surficial geology of the sea\nfloor of Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS) and changes in\nsurficial characteristics over time.  This GIS project presents\nmultibeam and other data in a digital format for analysis and display\nby scientists, policy makers, managers and the general public.\n\nThis project presents maps of the sea floor in GIS format of the\nHistoric Area Remedition Site (HARS), located offshore of New York and\nNew Jersey. The data were collected with a multibeam sea floor mapping\nsystem on surveys conducted November 23 - December 3, 1996, October 26\n- November 11, 1998, and April 6 - 30, 2000.  The maps show sea floor\ntopography, shaded relief, and backscatter intensity (a measure of sea\nfloor texture and roughness) at a spatial resolution of 3 m/pixel, and\nlocations of dredged material placed on the sea floor.  The sea floor\nof the HARS, approximately 9 square nautical miles in area, is being\nremediated by placing at least a one-meter of clean dredged material\non top of the existing surface sediments that exhibit varying degrees\ndegradation resulting from previous disposal of dredged and other\nmaterial.  Comparison of the topography and backscatter intensity from\nthe three surveys show changes in topography and surficial sediment\nproperties resulting from placement of dredged material in 1996 and\n1997 prior to designation of the HARS, as well as placement of\nmaterial for remediation of the HARS.  This study is carried out\ncooperatively by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers.",
