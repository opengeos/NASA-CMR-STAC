    "description": "In-situ chemical oxidation (ICO) is a remediation technology that involves the addition of chemicals to the substrate that degrade contaminants through oxidation processes.  This series of field experiments conducted at the Old Casey Powerhouse/Workshop investigate the potential for the use of ICO technology in Antarctica on petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sediments.\n\nSurface application was made using 12.5% sodium hyperchlorite, 6.25% sodium hydrechlorite, 30% hydrogen peroxide and Fentons Reagent (sodium hypchlorite with an iron catalyst) on five separate areas of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sediments.  Sampling was conducted before and after chemical application from the top soil section (0 - 5 cm) and at depth (10 - 15 cm).\n\nThe data are stored in an excel file.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 1163 (ASAC_1163).\n\nThe spreadsheet is divided up as follows:\n\nThe first  51 sheets are the raw GC-FID data for the 99/00 field season, labelled by sample name. These sheets use the same format as the radiometric GC-FID spreadsheet in the metadata record entitled 'Mineralisation results using 14C octadecane at a range of temperatures'. Sample name format consists of a location or experiment indicator (CW=Casey Workshop, BR= Small-scale field trial), the year the sample was collected (00=2000), the sample type (S=Soil) and a sequence number.\n\nSUMMARY and PRINTABLE VERSION are the same data in different formats, PRINTABLE VERSION is printer friendly. This summary data includes the hydrocarbon concentrations corrected for dry weight of soil and biodegradation and weathering indices.\n\nGRAPHS are graphs.\n \nFIELD MEASUREMENTS show the results of the measurements taken in the field and include PID (ppm), Soil temperature (C), Air temperature (C), Ph and MC (moisture content) (%).\n\nNOTES shows the chemicals added to each trial, and a short summary of the samples.\n\nThe next 21 sheets show the raw GC-FID data for the 00/01 field season, labelled to previously explained method. PRINTABLE (0001) is a summary of the raw GC-FID data.\n\nThe next 3 sheets show the raw GC-FID data for the 01/02 field season, labelled to previously explained method. PRINTABLE (0102) is a summary of the raw GC-FID data.\n\nMPN-NOTES shows lab book references and set up summary for the Most Probable Number (MPN) analysis.\n\nMPN-DETAILS shows the set up details, calculations and results for each MPN analysis.\n\nMPN-RESULTS shows the raw MPN data.\n\nMPN-Calculations show the results from the MPN Calculator.\n\nThe fields in the dataset are:\nRetention Time\nArea\n% Area\nHeight of peak\nAmount\nInt Type\nUnits\nPeak Type\nCodes",
