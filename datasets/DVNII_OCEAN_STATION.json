In\n      addition, currents are available from some stations. These\n      observations go back to 1957. Russian data prevail; data from\n      international expeditions (IIOE) are also  available. Data\n      access is restricted.\n      \n      FILE:   Deep-sea oceanographic data; East Tropical Pacific\n      (20S-20N, 180W-90W)\n      This data holding consists of about 20,000 stations (bathometer and\n      STD) of salinity, temperature (including sea surface), and\n      oxygen. In addition, currents are available from some\n      stations. These observations go back to 1964. Russian data\n      prevail; a good deal of US data from published sources  (Passat\n      Experiment and Shuttle) is also available. Data access is\n      restricted.\n      \n      FILE: Deep-sea oceanographic data; Sea of Japan, Bering Sea, Sea of\n      Okhotsk\n      Physical and chemical data is available from about 80,000 stations\n      (the Sea of Japan), about 60,000 stations (the Sea of Okhotsk), and\n      about 37,500 stations (the Bering Sea). Temperature and Salinity,\n      as well as alkalinity. Oxygen, pH, PO4, Si, and NO2 (hydrochemical\n      elements have not been measured at every station).  Data taken with\n      bathometer and STD. Russian data prevail; US and Japanese data\n      taken from published sources are  also\n      available. Data access is restricted.\n      \n      FILE: Deep-sea oceanographic data; Northwest Pacific (18N-44N,\n      127E-156E)\n      Over 42,000 oceanographic stations of temperature and salinity,\n      dating back to 1930. Data taken with bathometer and STD. Russian\n      data prevail; a great deal of Japanese data for the SIK and KER\n      programmes (taken from published sources) is also available. Data\n      access is restricted.\n      \n      FILE:   Mean-monthly sea-surface temperature; North of 20N in the\n      Pacific\n      Finally, this data set consists of mean-monthly sea-surface\n      temperature and its anomalies in the North Pacific over two and a\n      half degree squares (7,500) values, from 1966 to 1986. Weather data\n      are used to compile  this data set.  Data access is restricted.",
