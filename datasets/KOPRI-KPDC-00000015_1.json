    "description": "Korean Antarctic survey carried out as part of step 2 project in year 3 of 'The Antarctic Undersea Geological Survey' in 1999 was conducted in the periphery of the continent near Anvers Island in the northwestern part of the Antarctic Peninsula. The research period was from 27 Dec. in 1999 to 3 Jan. in 2000 (8 days). After a geophysical survey was conducted to obtain data such as seismic, submarine topography, gravity, terrestrial magnetism, drilling investigation was conducted in the coring point was decided from combined geophysics data. 13 researchers from \u2018Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute\u2019 and an out-of-the-way researcher participated for field investigation members. We used a 'Onnuri', of 'the Korea Ocean Research Institute' to be used for Antarctic research since 1993.",
