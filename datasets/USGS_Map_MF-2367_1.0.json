    "description": "The digital map database, compiled from previously published and unpublished\ndata, and new mapping by the authors, represents the general distribution of\nbedrock and surficial deposits in the House Rock Spring area.  Together with\nthe accompanying text, it provides current information on the geologic\nstructure and stratigraphy of the area covered.  The database delineates map\nunits that are identified by general age, lithology, and geomorphology\nfollowing the spatial resolution (scale) of the database to 1:24,000.  The\ncontent and character of the database, as well as three methods of obtaining\nthe database, are described below.\n\nThis digital map database is compiled from unpublished data and new mapping by\nthe authors, represents the general distribution of surficial and bedrock\ngeology in the mapped area.  Together with the accompanying pamphlet, it\nprovides current information on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the\narea.  The database delineate map units that are identified by age and\nlithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution of the\ndatabase to 1:24,000 or smaller.\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (ARC/ INFO\ncoverages) and supporting text and plot files.  In addition, the report\nincludes two sets of plot files(Post Script and PDF format) that will generate\nmap sheets and pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field\nStudies Report.  These files are described in the explanatory pamphlets\n(hrsgeo.doc, hrsgeo. pdf, or hrsgeo.txt).  The base layer used in the\npreparation of the geologic map plot files was derived from a Digital Raster\nGraphic version of a standard USGS 7.5' quadrangle.  This raster image was\nconverted to Grid format in ARC/INFO, trimmed and converted to a GeoTIFF image.\n The resultant TIFF image was combined with geologic data to produce the final\nmap image in Illustrator 8.0.",
