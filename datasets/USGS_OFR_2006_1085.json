    "description": "High-resolution measurements of waves, currents, water levels, temperature,\nsalinity and turbidity were made in Hanalei Bay, northern Kauai, Hawaii, during\nthe summer of 2005 to better understand coastal circulation and sediment\ndynamics in coral reef habitats. A series of bottom-mounted instrument packages\nwere deployed in water depths of 10 m or less to collect long-term,\nhigh-resolution measurements of waves, currents, water levels, temperature,\nsalinity and turbidity. These data were supplemented with a series of vertical\ninstrument casts to characterize the vertical and spatial variability in water\ncolumn properties within the bay. The purpose of these measurements was to\ncollect hydrographic data to learn how waves, currents and water column\nproperties vary spatially and temporally in an embayment that hosts a nearshore\ncoral reef ecosystem adjacent to a major river drainage. These measurements\nsupport the ongoing process studies being conducted as part of the U.S.\nGeological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program's Coral Reef\nProject; the ultimate goal is to better understand the transport mechanisms of\nsediment, larvae, pollutants and other particles in coral reef settings. This\nreport, the first part in a series, describes data acquisition, processing and\nanalysis.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
