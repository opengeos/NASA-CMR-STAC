    "description": "This metadata record has been created to describe a commercial CD product of the Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification. This CD has in no way been produced by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), and the metadata record is only intended as a reference for AAD employees.\n\nFrom the CD booklet:\n\nThis CD-ROM title covers Marine Mammals of the World and is based on the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Species Identification Guide, supplemented with updated information and full colour pictures.  This product comprises a detailed and up-to-date overview of all species in this group.  Many people contributed to this CD-ROM; an extensive list is provided in the program itself.  Dr T.A. Jefferson, Dr S. Leatherwood and Dr M.A. Webber are the authors of the book and reviewed the CD-ROM contents; Dr P.A. Folkens kindly provided his original drawings.  Drs M. Brugman, A. van Hertum and Ing. G. Gijswijt served as technical editors.  Dr P. van Bree of the Zoological Museum Amsterdam updated the distribution data. Dr R.  Leewis of Thalassa Picture Services contacted numerous authors for high-quality photographic, video, and audio materials.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Species Identification and Data Program is to provide basic tools necessary for the management of fishery resources.  In order to manage a fishery resource, either through a biological population or community approach, information such as growth parameters, habitat preference, reproduction, and feeding types is required for each species.  A problem for data collection occurs because a wide diversity of species are encountered in fisheries, especially in the tropics.  If a species is not identified correctly, then biological information attributed to it can be meaningless or, worse, misleading.  This program produces documents that allow proper identification and provide biological and fisheries information for each species.  Furthermore, the Species Identification and Data Program is the only program of its kind that provides this vital service for fisheries on a global basis.  This service is provided mostly through the production of three types of documents, each with identification tools and with different levels of coverage of biological and fisheries information: 1) Global Soecies Catalogues for specific resource groups (for example, shrimps, sharks, and snappers) with extensive information, 2) Identification Guides with intermediate level information for larger regions (for example, the western Indian Ocean or FAO Fishing Area 51), and 3) Field Guides with abbreviated information for a country or group of countries (for example, Mozambique and the northern coast of South America).\n\nThis is a worldwide guide to the identification of marine mammals and those cetaceans, seals, and sireneans also found in fresh water.  The 119 species include a variety of taxa: baleen whales, toothed whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, sireneans, marine otters, and the polar bear.  In total, 121 distribution maps and more than 1000 illustrations were included to fully describe the species and identification characters.  Where available, videos and sounds were added as well.\n\nThe Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification (ETI) is a Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) in operational relation with UNESCO, dedicated to the production of scientific and educational computer software for the preservation of knowledge concerning the worlds plants and animals.  ETI is supported by The Netherlands Government, the University of Amsterdam, UNESCO, and other international organisations.  It cooperates with major scientific institutes around the world.",
