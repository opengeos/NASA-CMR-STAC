    "description": "Flavescence dor\u00e9e (FD) is a grapevine disease caused by associated phytoplasmas (FDp), which are epidemically spread by their main vector Scaphoideus titanus. The possible roles of alternative and secondary FDp plant hosts and vectors have gained interest to better understand the FDp ecology and epidemiology. A survey conducted in the surroundings of a vineyard in the Swiss Southern Alps aimed at studying the possible epidemiological role of the FDp secondary vector Orientus ishidae and the FDp host plant Alnus glutinosa is reported.     Data used for the publication.  Insects were captured by using a sweeping net (on common alder trees) and yellow sticky traps (Rebell Giallo, Andermatt Biocontrol AG, Switzerland) placed in the vineyard canopy. Insects were later determined and selected for molecular analyses.  Grapevines and common alder samples were collected using the standard techniques. The molecular analyses were conducted in order to identify samples infected by the Flavescence dor\u00e9e phytoplasma (16SrV-p) and the Bois Noir phytoplasma (16SrXII-p). A selection of the infected sampled were further characterized by map genotype and sequenced in order to compare the genotypes in insects, grapevines and common alder trees.",
