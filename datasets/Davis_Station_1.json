    "description": "This dataset represents topographic features of Davis Station, Antarctica.\nThe mapped features include coastline, contours, spot heights, high water mark (the 0.4 m contour was used as the high water mark) and station infrastructure (buildings, masts, aerials, tanks, pipes and other structures).\n\nThe data are included in the data available for download from the provided URL.\n\nThe data conform to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See a Related URL below.\nData described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 16.\nEach feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets and quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature.\n\nChanges have occurred at the station since this dataset was produced. For example some buildings and other structures have been removed and some added.\nAs a result the data available for download from the provided URL is updated with new data having different Dataset_id(s).",
