    "description": "Refer to antFOCE report section 4.4.5 for deployment, sampling and analysis details.\n\nhttps://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/AAS_4127_antFOCE_Project4127\n\nOne camera and flash unit was mounted on the top middle section of each chamber to take one photo of the sediment every 30 minutes. \n\nThe download file contains two folders with the photos taken from the 28th of January to the 23rd of February 2015 \u2013 one for Chamber A and one for Chamber C. A video time-lapse compilation of the Chamber A images is also included. Malfunctioning cameras deployed on Chamber A and C and on B and D during this same period and at other times, meant that no useful images were obtained. \n\nBackground \n\nThe antFOCE experimental system was deployed in O'Brien Bay, approximately 5 kilometres south of Casey station, East Antarctica, in the austral summer of 2014/15. Surface and sub-surface (in water below the sea ice) infrastructure allowed controlled manipulation of seawater pH levels (reduced by 0.4 pH units below ambient) in 2 chambers placed on the sea floor over natural benthic communities. Two control chambers (no pH manipulation) and two open plots (no chambers, no pH manipulation) were also sampled to compare to the pH manipulated (acidified) treatment chambers.  \n\nDetails of the antFOCE experiment can be found in the report \u2013 \"antFOCE 2014/15 \u2013 Experimental System, Deployment, Sampling and Analysis\". This report and a diagram indicating how the various antFOCE data sets relate to each other are available at:\n\nhttps://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/AAS_4127_antFOCE_Project4127",
