    "description": "GCOM-C/SGLI L2 Statistics-Land Surface Reflectance (GEOI) (8-Days, 250m) is obtained from the SGLI sensor onboard GCOM-C and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).  Using the Level2 atmospheric corrected land surface reflectance tile product as input, BRDF correction is performed for the land surface in clear region using data of multiple days, and the reflectance equivalent to that at nadir view direction is stored in the output product. The region definition and spatial resolutions of the output product are kept the input data. In 8-days processing, the land surface reflectance data of the past 24 days, respectively are fitted to generate appropriate BRDF models with the correction coefficients. GCOM-C is Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent Orbit satellite launched on December 23, 2017, which mounts SGLI and conducts long-term global observations of geophysical variables related to the global climate system across 28 items including aerosol and vegetation over 4 areas of atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere. The data will be used to contribute to higher accuracy of global warming prediction. The SGLI has swath of 1150 km in the visible band and 1400 km in the infrared band. The Geometry data of IRS sensor is stored. This dataset includes of following SDs: GEOI_Date is Date identification of RSRF/GEOI [unit:none]GEOI_Ninput is Input data number of RSRF/GEOI [unit:none]GEOI_Nused is Used data number of RSRF/GEOI [unit:none]GEOI_QA_flag is Level-3 8-bit flag of RSRF/GEOI [unit:none]Relative_azimuth_AVE is Normal of Relative azimuth angle [degree]Relative_azimuth_MAX is Maximum of Relative azimuth angle [degree]Relative_azimuth_MIN is Minimum of Relative azimuth angle [degree]Sensor_zenith_AVE is Normal of Sensor zenith angle [degree]Sensor_zenith_MAX is Maximum of Sensor zenith angle [degree]Sensor_zenith_MIN is Minimum of Sensor zenith angle [degree]Solar_zenith_AVE is Normal of Solar zenith angle [degree]Solar_zenith_MAX is Maximum of Sensor zenith angle [degree]Solar_zenith_MIN is Minimum of Solar zenith angle [degree]The provided format is HDF5. The spatial resolution is 250 m. The statistical period is 8 days also 1 month statistics is available. The projection method is EQA. The generation unit is \"Tile\". The current version of the product is Version 3. The Version 2 is also available.",
