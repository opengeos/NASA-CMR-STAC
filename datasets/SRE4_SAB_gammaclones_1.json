    "description": "A clone library was created from DNA extracted from an SAB-treated sample from the SRE4 in situ biodegradation experiment. The clone libary was created using one universal primer and one primer designed to be specific for the gammaproteobacteria. Sequences of approximately 600 bp were obtained.\n\nThe samples used in this experiment were collected from O'Brien Bay, near Casey Station in the Windmill Islands.\n\nGammaproteobacteria clone library\n\nClone library created from SRE4 T2 SAB sample using primers 10F (GAG TTT GAT CCT GGC TCA G ) and GAMR (GGT AAG GTT CTT CGC GTT GCA T).\n\nClones sequenced on a CEQ8000 Genetic Analysis system (Beckman-Coulter) and alignments were done in BioEdit v 5.0.9.\n\nText file SRE4gammaclonesalign is a text version of BioEdit file SRE4gammaclones.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 2672 (ASAC_2672).",
