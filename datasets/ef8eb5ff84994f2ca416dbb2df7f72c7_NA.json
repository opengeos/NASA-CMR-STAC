    "description": "This dataset contains Daily Snow Cover Fraction of viewable snow from the MODIS satellite instruments, produced by the Snow project of the ESA Climate Change Initiative programme.  Snow cover fraction viewable (SCFV) indicates the area of snow viewable from space over all land surfaces. In forested areas this refers to snow viewable on top of the forest canopy. The SCFV is given in percentage (%) per pixel. The global SCFV product is available at about 1 km pixel size for all land areas, excluding Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets. The coastal zones of Greenland are included. The SCFV time series provides daily products for the period 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2019. The SCFV product is based on Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data on-board the Terra satellite. The retrieval method of the snow_cci SCFV product from MODIS data has been further developed and improved based on the ESA GlobSnow approach described by Mets\u00c3\u00a4m\u00c3\u00a4ki et al. (2015) and complemented with a pre-classification module developed by ENVEO. For the SCFV product generation from MODIS, multiple reflective and emissive spectral bands are used. In a first step, clouds are masked using an adapted version of the Simple Cloud Detection Algorithm version 2.0 (SCDA2.0) (Mets\u00c3\u00a4m\u00c3\u00a4ki et al., 2015). All cloud free pixels are then used for the snow extent mapping, using spectral bands centred at about 550 nm and 1.6 \u00c2\u00b5m, and an emissive band centred at about 11 \u00c2\u00b5m. The snow_cci snow cover mapping algorithm is a two-step approach: first, a strict pre-classification is applied to identify all cloud free pixels which are certainly snow free. For all remaining pixels, the snow_cci SCFV retrieval method is applied. Improvements to the GlobSnow algorithm implemented for snow_cci version 1 include (i) the utilisation of a background reflectance map derived from statistical analyses of MODIS time series replacing the constant values for snow free ground used in the GlobSnow approach, and (ii) the adaptation of the retrieval method for mapping in forested areas the SCFV. Permanent snow and ice, and water areas are masked based on the Land Cover CCI data set of the year 2000. Both classes were separately aggregated to the pixel spacing of the SCFV product. Water areas are masked if more than 30 percent of the pixel is classified as water, permanent snow and ice areas are masked if more than 50 percent are identified as such areas in the aggregated map. The product uncertainty for observed land pixels is provided as unbiased root mean square error (RMSE) per pixel in the ancillary variable.The SCFV product is aimed to serve the needs for users working in the cryosphere and climate research and monitoring activities, including the detection of variability and trends, climate modelling and aspects of hydrology, meteorology, and biology.ENVEO is responsible for the SCFV product development and generation from MODIS data, SYKE supported the development.There are a few days without any MODIS acquisitions in the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2008, 2016 and 2018. On several days in the years 2000 to 2006, and on a few days in the years 2012, 2015 and 2016, the acquired MODIS data have either only limited coverage, or some of the MODIS data were corrupted during the download process. For these days, the SCFV products are available but have data gaps.",
