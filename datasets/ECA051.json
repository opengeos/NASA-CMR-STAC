    "description": "The aim of the present work is to characterize the local atmospheric emissions levels and compare them to the component derived from global pollution in a remote site at South Hemisphere (Admiralty Bay located at King George Island in Antarctic Peninsula). Airborne particles, snow and soil/sediments samples were analyzed. Local-produced atmospheric aerosol dispersion was estimated for metals originated by fossil fuel burning from the permanent scientific stations using a simplified Gaussian model. Validation of atmospheric dispersion was established by in situ measurements. Soluble and insoluble particles deposited in freshly snow and airborne particles were analyzed by PIXE (Particle Induced X-Ray Emission) for the determination of the elemental mass concentration and to obtain the Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD). The results showed significant correlation between the concentration of atmospheric aerosol and the freshly deposited particles in the snow, and permitted an estimate of the atmospheric snow deposition factor for K, Cu, Zn, Fe, Pb, and Ti. Results of long-term aerosol data compilation suggest that besides the local aerosol sources, the continental atmospheric transport of airborne particles is not significantly affected by the airborne particles produced by local human impacts at King George Island.",
