    "description": "Multispectral imagery of the state of Alabama is available from the\n            Geological Survey of Alabama for the time period of 1972-1984.\n            Imagery from the Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) is available as\n            prints or transparencies for all bands (with selected color composites\n            avaliable) at an approximate scale of 1:1,000,000.  MSS data is\n            collected in four spectral bands ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 micrometer\n            with a ground resolution of about 80m.\n            \n            Images available from Skylab 3 and 4 include 9 x 9 prints and\n            transparencies at 1:750,000 (skylab 3) and 1:500,000 (skylab 4).\n            These images were taken in 1973 and are along three tracks; northeast\n            from New Orleans, LA to South Carolina, northeast from Pensacola, FL\n            to Columbus, GA, and from Pearl River, Jackson MI to Pensacola, FL.\n            The multispectral photographic facility onboard Skylab provided\n            imagery in several wavelength bands ranging from 0.5 to 0.9\n            Micrometers.  This camera system provided ground resolution of\n            approximately 40 m in visible wavelengths to 75 m in the infrared.\n            \n            A variety of high and low altitude aircraft imagery of Alabama is also\n            available from the Geological Survey of Alabama.  Microfiche images of\n            MSS/TM imagery of North America since 1986 (landsat browse imagery)\n            are also available.  Similar imagery for other locations and time\n            periods is available from the Eros Data Center.",
