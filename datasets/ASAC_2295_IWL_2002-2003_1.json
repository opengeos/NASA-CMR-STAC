    "description": "This research was a manipulative experiment on autoline ling vessels in the New Zealand ling fishery. The vessels were the Janas and the Avro Chieftain. The experiment examined both seabird bycatch data and fish catch data, as well as operational aspects of fishing with integrated weight longline. The data is a little bit complicated and it is essential that any users be familiar with the methodologies in the scientific paper that was published from the work. That will provide a lot of necessary guidance as well as a context for the research. The data covers 2002 and 2003, as indicated on the files.\n\nThe data submitted includes relevant information of i) seabird by-catch; ii) catch rates of target fish; iii) catch rates on non-target fish. There is replication in some of the data sheets provided. There are headers in each data file that are explanatory.",
