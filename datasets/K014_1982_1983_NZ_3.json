    "description": "Specially Protected area No.7 is located at the base of Seabee Spit and comprises two major habitat types: a large flat area interrupted by small hummocks and depressions, and adjoining steep scree slopes which form part of the western side of Cape Hallett. In order to provide some up to date information on the current status of the SPA, the distribution of vegetation was surveyed and an environmental assessment carried out to identify any damage caused by previous occupation of the area by man. The adequacy of the present boundaries (1983) was also examined. The algae, mosses and lichens of Cape Hallett were surveyed in two ways: a) A series of photographs was taken to provide overlapping coverage of the SPA and surrounding areas at a small scale. This will allow a sketch map to be made showing broad vegetation distribution patterns, extent of penguin colonies, nature of the topography, occurrence of permanent snow patches and areas of melt water accumulation. b) Three vertical transects were laid across the SPA running west to east over the flat and up the scree slopes. At 5m intervals along each transect the area within a 25 x 25 cm quadrat was examined to provide data on species distribution and cover, the nature of the substrate, slope, aspect, and relative abundance and moisture. The presence/absence of collembola and mites was also recorded as was evidence of the presence of skuas, seals and penguins. A total of 600 quadrats were sampled.",
