    "description": "This database was developed to improve upon previous mapping in the central\nMarysvale volcanic field and compile older mapping at a consistent scale.  This\narea is an important mining district, and a regional understanding of the\ngeology and mineral deposits will assist in understanding genesis of deposits\nand in exploration for new deposits.  The area is also an important part of the\ntransition zone between the Colorado Plateau to the east and the Great Basin to\nthe west.  This tectonically significant province may hold keys to the style\nand mechanisms of continent-scale deformation in the Western United States.\n\nThe geologic map of the central Marysvale volcanic field, southwestern Utah,\nshows the geology at 1:100,000 scale of the heart of one of the largest\nCenozoic volcanic fields in the Western United States.  The map shows the area\nof 38 degrees 15' to 38 degrees 42'30\" N., and 112 degrees to 112 degrees\n37'30\" W.  The Marysvale field occurs mostly in the High Plateaus, a\nsubprovince of the Colorado Plateau and structurally a transition zone between\nthe complexly deformed Great Basin to the west and the stable, little-deformed\nmain part of the Colorado Plateau to the east.  The western part of the field\nis in the Great Basin proper.  The volcanic rocks and their source intrusions\nin the volcanic field range in age from about 31 Ma (Oligocene) to about 0.5 Ma\n(Pleistocene).  These rocks overlie sedimentary rocks exposed in the mapped\narea that range in age from Ordovician to early Cenozoic.  The area has been\ndeformed by thrust faults and folds formed during the late Mesozoic to early\nCenozoic Sevier deformational event, and later by mostly normal faults and\nfolds of the Miocene to Quaternary basin-range episode.  The map revises and\nupdates knowledge gained during a long-term U.S. Geological Survey\ninvestigation of the volcanic field, done in part because of its extensive\nhistory of mining.  The investigation also was done to provide framework\ngeologic knowledge suitable for defining geologic and hydrologic hazards, for\nlocating hydrologic and mineral resources, and for an understanding of geologic\nprocesses in the area.  A previous geologic map (Cunningham and others, 1983,\nU.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Investigations Series I-1430-A) covered\nthe same area as this map but was published at 1:50,000 scale and is obsolete\ndue to new data.  This new geologic map of the central Marysvale field, here\npublished as U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Investigations Series I-2645-A, is\naccompanied by gravity and aeromagnetic maps of the same area and the same\nscale (Campbell and others, 1999, U.S. Geological Survey Geologic\nInvestigations Series I-2645-B).",
