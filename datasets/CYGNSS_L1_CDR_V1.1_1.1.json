    "description": "This Level 1 (L1) dataset contains the Version 1.1 Climate Data Record (CDR) of the geo-located Delay Doppler Maps (DDMs) calibrated into Power Received (Watts) and Bistatic Radar Cross Section (BRCS) expressed in units of m2 from the Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument aboard the CYGNSS satellite constellation. Other useful scientific and engineering measurement parameters include the DDM of Normalized Bistatic Radar Cross Section (NBRCS), the Delay Doppler Map Average (DDMA) of the NBRCS near the specular reflection point, and the Leading Edge Slope (LES) of the integrated delay waveform. The L1 dataset contains a number of other engineering and science measurement parameters, including sets of quality flags/indicators, error estimates, and bias estimates as well as a variety of orbital, spacecraft/sensor health, timekeeping, and geolocation parameters. At most, 8 netCDF data files (each file corresponding to a unique spacecraft in the CYGNSS constellation) are provided each day; under nominal conditions, there are typically 6-8 spacecraft retrieving data each day, but this can be maximized to 8 spacecraft under special circumstances in which higher than normal retrieval frequency is needed (i.e., during tropical storms and or hurricanes). Latency is approximately 1 month, depending on the availability of the MERRA wind speed reanalysis. The Version 1.1 CDR is a collection of reanalysis products derived from the SDR v3.0 Level 1 data (https://doi.org/10.5067/CYGNS-L1X30 ). Calibration accuracy and long term stability are improved relative to SDR v3.0 using the same trackwise correction algorithm as was used by CDR v1.0 (https://doi.org/10.5067/CYGNS-L1C10 ), which was derived from SDR v2.1 Level 1 data (https://doi.org/10.5067/CYGNS-L1X21 ). Details of the algorithm are provided in the Trackwise Corrected CDR Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document.  Trackwise correction is applied to the two primary CYGNSS L1 science data products, the normalized bistatic radar cross section (NBRCS) and the LES. The correction compensates for small errors in the Level 1 calibration, due e.g. to uncertainties in the GPS transmitting antenna gain patterns and the CYGNSS receiving antenna gain patterns. It should be noted that the trackwise correction algorithm cannot be successfully applied to all v3.0 SDR L1 data, so there is also some loss of samples that were present in v3.0.",
