    "description": "Seven colonies with breeding Adelie colonies were mapped this season in the Kista Island group between the 17th and 27th of November 2015. Subcolonies were mapped by circumnavigating the perimeter on foot while carrying a Garmin GPS (Etrex30) to record the track.\n\nWhen mapping the perimeter of the subcolonies, generally an average buffer distance of 2.5 meters was maintained between the mapper and breeding birds. However on Klung Island one of the mappers was mapping at a distance between 3 and 5m. Buffer distances were reduced accordingly for the varying tracks to produce a combined average buffer distance of 2m in the final layer. Given this the boundary mapping for these two islands may vary in accuracy. \n\nNote when mapping was undertaken at Peterson Island (74507) two subcolonies were not mapped when compared to mapping in the 13/14 season. The larger of these colonies was missed but the smaller colony did not exist in the 15/16 season.  ",
