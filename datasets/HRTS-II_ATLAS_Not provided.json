    "description": "An ultraviolet spectral Atlas of a sunspot with high spectral and\nspatial resolution in the wavelength region 1190 - 1730 A is\npresented. The sunspot was observed with the High Resolution Telescope\nand Spectrograph (HRTS).  The HRTS instrument was built at the U.S.\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, D.C. (Bartoe and\nBrueckner, 1975). The instrument combines high spatial, spectral, and\ntime resolution with an extensive wavelength and angular\ncoverage. This makes HRTS particularly well suited for studies of fine\nstructure and mass flows in the upper solar atmosphere.  HRTS has\nflown six times on rockets between 1975 and 1989 and as a part of\nSpacelab 2 in 1985.\n\nThe spectrograms used for the Atlas are from the second HRTS rocket\nflight, known as HRTS II, flown on 13 February 1978 aboard a Black\nBrant VC rocket (NASA Flight 21.042) at White Sands, New Mexico.\nDuring the rocket flight the slit was oriented radially from the solar\ndisc center through the active region McMath 15139, including a\nsunspot, and across the solar limb. The Solar Pointing Aerobee Rocket\nControl System (SPARCS) kept the spectrograph slit positioned on the\nsolar surface during the observing time of 4.2 minutes. The spatial\nresolution on this flight was 2 arcsec with a time resolution from 0.2\n- 20.2 sec.\n\nThe HRTS spectra were recorded on Eastman Kodak 101-01 photographic\nfilm.  Microphotometry of the spectrograms has been carried out at the\nInstitute of Theoretical Astrophysics in Oslo.  The data reduction\nincludes correcting the spectral images for geometrical distortion,\nFourier filtering to remove high frequency noise, transformation to\nabsolute calibrated solar intensity and calibration of the wavelength\nscale.\n\nThe absolute intensity calibration was obtained by comparing relative\nintensity scans of a quiet solar region with absolute intensities from\nthe Skylab S082B calibration rocket, CALROC The resulting absolute\nintensities are accurate to within 30% (rms).\n\nThe wavelength scale was established using solar lines from neutral\nand singly ionized atoms as reference lines.  From this wavelength\nscale velocities accurate to 2 km/s can be measured over the entire\nwavelength range.  The measured velocities are, however, relative to\nthe average velocity in the chromosphere where the reference lines are\nformed.\n\nThe Atlas contains spectra of three different areas in the sunspot and\nalso of an active region and a quiet region. The selected areas are\naveraged over several arcsec, ranging from 3.5 arcsec in the sunspot\nto 18 arcsec in the quiet region. The transition region lines in the\nAtlas show the most extreme example known of downflowing gas above a\nsunspot, a phenomenon which seems to be commonly occurring in sunspots.\n\nOne of the selected areas in the sunspot is a light bridge crossing\nthe spot.  This is the most interesting sunspot region where the\ncontinuum radiation is enhanced and measurable throughout the HRTS\nspectral range.  A number of lines appear which do not occur in the\nregular sunspot spectrum.\n\nThe Atlas is available in a machine readable form together with an IDL\nprogram to interactively measure linewidths, total intensities and\nsolar wavelengths.
