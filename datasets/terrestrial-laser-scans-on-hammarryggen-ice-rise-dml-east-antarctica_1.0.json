    "description": "Surface topography maps (spatial extent: 400 m x 400 m) obtained at approximately 300 m from the top of the Hammarryggen Ice Rise in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, using a Riegl VZ-6000 Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). Scans were obtained on 5 days in the 2018-2019 Austral summer: on December 21 and 27, and January 2, 4 and 11. By using reflectors installed on bamboo poles, scans were registered with respect to the reflectors, such that the difference between two successive scans reveals the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition of snow. On each scan day, we used multiple scan positions to create one combined point cloud. After applying an octree filter on the point cloud, a 3D surface was obtained. For each day, the dataset contains a 1 mm and a 10 cm octree filter resolution file, only including points in a 400 m x 400 m area centered around the scan positions.    Notes:    * All files in the dataset are in the same coordinate system. However, this coordinate system is arbitrary (i.e., not related to any global coordinate system).    * From the installed reflectors, 4 reflectors could be used over the full period. The scan accuracy is generally higher within the area enclosed by the reflectors.    * The scans from January 2 were found to have exhibited small tilt during the scan and are of lesser accuracy.    * By walking along fixed corridors, disturbance of the snow was limited.",
