    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data set that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.\n\nThis data set consists of digitized polygons of a constant hydraulic\nconductivity value for the Antlers aquifer in southeastern Oklahoma. The Early\nCretaceous-age Antlers Sandstone is an important source of water in an area\nthat underlies about 4,400-square miles of all or part of Atoka, Bryan, Carter,\nChoctaw, Johnston, Love, Marshall, McCurtain, and Pushmataha Counties. The\nAntlers aquifer consists of sand, clay, conglomerate, and limestone in the\noutcrop area. The upper part of the Antlers aquifer consists of beds of sand,\npoorly cemented sandstone, sandy shale, silt, and clay. The Antlers aquifer is\nunconfined where it outcrops in about an 1,800-square-mile area. \n\nThe hydraulic conductivity polygons were developed from the hydraulic\nconductivity value used as input into a ground-water flow model and from\npublished digital data sets of the surficial geology of the Antlers Sandstone\nexcept in areas overlain by alluvial and terrace deposits near streams. Some of\nthe lines were interpolated where the Antlers aquifer is overlain by alluvial\nand terrace deposits. The interpolated lines are very similar to the aquifer\nboundaries shown on maps published in a ground-water modeling report for the\nAntlers aquifer. The constant hydraulic conductivity value used as input to the\nground-water flow model was estimated as 5.74 feet per day.\n\nGround-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and\naggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of\naquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of\nhydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented in this data set are not\nprecise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently\ncollected data.",
