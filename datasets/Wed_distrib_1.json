    "description": "The information in the dataset is the location of Weddell seals with pups at the Vestfold Hills. Resolution of locations is 0.63 sq. kilometres because the data are recorded as x-y coordinates of a grid-square map (see metadata record 'Weddell seal reporting grid of the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica', Data Set ID 'Wed-map'). The source of the data are the Australian Antarctic Division TAGS database, Report No. 11 (pups per annum/season - sorted by X and Y). The data consists of counts of tagged pups per grid square summed over 24 years, and also counts of years that each grid square was occupied by one or more pup. The data are expressed as number, percentage of total number, and ratio of number of pups to number of years occupied for each grid square. The total number of pups is 3 795 pups. The total number of years is 24 years. Temporal coverage is 1973-1999 excluding years 1975, 1976, and 1997 because seals were recorded in few grid squares in those years (2, 6, and 0 grid squares respectively). For the other 24 years, the average (+/- standard deviation) number of grid squares occupied per year is 21.5 +/- 6.5 grid squares per year. The average (+/- standard deviation) number of pups born and tagged per year is 158.1 +/- 31.0 pups per year. This and other spatial data for Weddell seals at the Vestfold Hills has been published in ANARE Research Notes 19 (Green et al. 1995) and also in Sam Lake's masters thesis (1995). \n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nGridsquare\nCount\nTotal\nCount/Year\nCount%\nTotal%",
