    "description": "A hydrologic analysis was made at three canal sites and four tidal sites along\nthe St. Lucie River Estuary in southeastern Florida from 1998 to 2001. The data\nincluded for analysis are stage, 15-minute flow, salinity, water temperature,\nturbidity, and suspended-solids concentration. During the period of record, the\nestuary experienced a drought, major storm events, and high-water discharge\nfrom Lake Okeechobee.\n\nFlow mainly occurred through the South Fork of the St. Lucie River; however,\nwhen flow increased through control structures along the C-23 and C-24 Canals,\nthe North Fork was a larger than usual contributor of total freshwater inflow\nto the estuary. At one tidal site (Steele Point), the majority of flow was\nsouthward toward the St. Lucie Inlet; at a second tidal site (Indian River\nBridge), the majority of flow was northward into the Indian River Lagoon.\n\nLarge-volume stormwater discharge events greatly affected the St. Lucie River\nEstuary. Increased discharge typically was accompanied by salinity decreases\nthat resulted in water becoming and remaining fresh throughout the estuary\nuntil the discharge events ended. Salinity in the estuary usually returned to\nprestorm levels within a few days after the events. Turbidity decreased and\nsalinity began to increase almost immediately when the gates at the control\nstructures closed. Salinity ranged from less than 1 to greater than 35 parts\nper thousand during the period of record (1998-2001), and typically varied by\nseveral parts per thousand during a tidal cycle.\n\nSuspended-solids concentrations were observed at one canal site (S-80) and two\ntidal sites (Speedy Point and Steele Point) during a discharge event in April\nand May 2000. Results suggest that most deposition of suspended-solids\nconcentration occurs between S-80 and Speedy Point. The turbidity data\ncollected also support this interpretation. The ratio of inorganic to organic\nsuspended-solids concentration observed at S-80, Speedy Point, and Steele Point\nduring the discharge event indicates that most flocculation of suspended-solids\nconcentration occurs between Speedy Point and Steele Point. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
