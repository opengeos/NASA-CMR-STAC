    "description": "The GPM Ground Validation CHILL Radar MC3E dataset was collected during the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E), which was held in Oklahoma were collected while the NASA ER-2 aircraft conducted a series of four legs along the 090 and 120 degree CHILL azimuths on May 24, 2011. Dual linear polarization variables as well as Doppler velocity, radial velocity, and normalized coherent power are contained in this dataset. In an effort to expand the MC3E sampling to a wider geographical area, the NASA ER-2 aircraft was directed to Northeastern Colorado while widespread rain was in progress on May 24, 2011. The aircraft flew a series of pre-defined ground tracks that coincided with radials from the CSU-CHILL radar. This aided in keeping the aircraft in the plane of a series of RHI scans done by CSU-CHILL. The single polarization CSU-Pawnee radar maintained volume coverage of the echo system while the radial flight legs were in progress. During aircraft course reversals at the ends of the radial legs, the CHILL and Pawnee radars started volume scans in synchronization to support dual Doppler wind syntheses. The Pawnee radar data are available as a seperate dataset.",
