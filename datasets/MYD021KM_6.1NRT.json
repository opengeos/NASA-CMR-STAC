    "description": "The MODIS Level 1B Near Real Time (NRT) data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 discrete bands located in the 0.4 to 14.4 micron region of electromagentic spectrum. These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). In addition, the Earth Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for the solar reflective bands (1-19, 26) through knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry).  Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.               Visible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime, while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.                                    Channel locations for MODIS are as follows:                                         Band   Center Wavelength (um)    Primary Use----   ----------------------    -----------1          0.620  - 0.670        Land/Cloud Boundaries2          0.841  - 0.876        Land/Cloud Boundaries3          0.459  - 0.479        Land/Cloud Properties4          0.545  - 0.565        Land/Cloud Properties5          1.230  - 1.250        Land/Cloud Properties6          1.628  - 1.652        Land/Cloud Properties7          2.105  - 2.155        Land/Cloud Properties8          0.405  - 0.420        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton9          0.438  - 0.448        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton10         0.483  - 0.493        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton11         0.526  - 0.536        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton12         0.546  - 0.556        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton13         0.662  - 0.672        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton14         0.673  - 0.683        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton15         0.743  - 0.753        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton16         0.862  - 0.877        Ocean Color/Phytoplankton17         0.890  - 0.920        Atmospheric Water Vapor18         0.931  - 0.941        Atmospheric Water Vapor19         0.915  - 0.965        Atmospheric Water Vapor20         3.660  - 3.840        Surface/Cloud Temperature21         3.929  - 3.989        Surface/Cloud Temperature22         3.929  - 3.989        Surface/Cloud Temperature23         4.020  - 4.080        Surface/Cloud Temperature24         4.433  - 4.498        Atmospheric Temperature25         4.482  - 4.549        Atmospheric Temperature26         1.360  - 1.390        Cirrus Clouds27         6.535  - 6.895        Water Vapor Profile28         7.175  - 7.475        Water Vapor Profile29         8.400  - 8.700        Water Vapor Profile30         9.580  - 9.880        Ozone Overburden31         10.780 - 11.280       Surface/Cloud Temperature32         11.770 - 12.270       Surface/Cloud Temperature33         13.185 - 13.485       Cloud Top Altitude34         13.485 - 13.785       Cloud Top Altitude35         13.785 - 14.085       Cloud Top Altitude36         14.085 - 14.385       Cloud Top Altitude                                         Channels 1 and 2 have 250 m resolution, channels 3 through 7 have 500m resolution, and the rest have 1 km resolution. However, for the MODIS L1B 1 km product, the 250 m and 500 m band radiance data and their associated uncertainties have been aggregated to 1km resolution. Thus the entire channel data set is referenced to the same spatial and geolocation scales. Separate L1B products are available for the 250 m channels (MYD02QKM) and 500 m channels (MYD02HKM) that preserve the original resolution of the data.                                         Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 1 km, degrading to 4.8 km in the along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution at the scan extremes is about 2km.  A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B granule will nominally contain a scene built from 203 scans (or swaths) sampled 1354 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data. Since an individual MODIS scan (or swath) will contain 10 along-track spatial elements, the scene will be composed of (1354 x 2030) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2030 km). Due to the  MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing overlap occurring beyond about 25 degrees scan angle.                                         To summarize, the MODIS L1B 1 km data product consists of:                                          1. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 1km resolution                                          2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 1 km resolution                                          3. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (13) 1 km reflected solar bands and (16) infrared emissive bands                                          4. Geolocation subsampled at every 5th pixel across and along track                                          5. Satellite and solar angles subsampled at the above frequency                                          6. Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument status and data quality characterization.                                         The MODIS L1B data are stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS) which is an extension of HDF as developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. A typical file size will be approximately 260 MB.                                         Environmental information derived from MODIS L1B measurements will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout the world.
