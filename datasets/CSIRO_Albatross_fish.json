    "description": "7, four- to five-day cruises were undertaken using the vessel\n      \"Jacqueline D\" in Albatross Bay, Gulf of Carpentaria between August\n      1986 and November 1988, using a random stratified trawl survey to\n      measure fish species composition and abundance. Four depth zones\n      between 7 and 45 m were sampled during both day and\n      night. Approximately 890,000 fish of 237 species were collected, of\n      which the bulk were made up of 25 species. The dominant families were\n      Leignathidae, Haemulidae and Clupeidae, with Sciaenidae and Dasyatidae\n      important at night. Leiognathus bindus was the most abundant species,\n      while Caranx bucculentus was the most frequently caught (96% of all\n      trawls). The suite of fishes was separately analysed for occurrence of\n      prawn predators.  This metadata record is sourced from 'MarLIN', the\n      CSIRO Marine Laboratories Information Network.\n      \n      Information was obtained from\n      http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/edd_search.Browse_Citation?txtSession=1621 .\n      The originating project was the Tropical Fish Ecology Project: Gulf of\n      Carpenteria studies.  The Tropical Fish Ecology project over this time\n      period carried out work on fish as peneid prawn predators in\n      Albatross Bay and the Embley Estuary, and as tiger prawn predators at\n      Groote Eylandt; fish surveys of the Gulf of Carpentaria; and the\n      biology of tuna baitfish in the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and the\n      Maldives (work commissioned by ACIAR).",
