    "description": "INPE's only receiving station for Landsat MSS was located in Cuiaba,\n            MT (geographic coordinates approx. 15.5S/56.0W). Data were acquired\n            routinely over the entire range from 1973 until 1986, some time after\n            TM data began being received. MSS data recordings were then reduced to\n            Brazilian territory only. Also, many gaps exist, some of them several\n            months long, related mostly to station downtimes caused by lightning.\n            \n            The MSS tapes recorded at Cuiaba were air shipped to the processing\n            and distribution center in Cachoeira Paulista, SP, where they are\n            kept. The holdings are estimated to be around 75,000 scenes (or\n            300,000 images, counting individually each of the four spectral\n            bands), not all of them processed. The fifth band (thermal infrared)\n            available on Landsat 3 is not counted for practical purposes. Very few\n            were processed at INPE with disappointing results and it was soon\n            dropped as a product.\n            \n            Demand for MSS products decreased sharply after TM products started\n            being distributed. This determined the reduction and eventually the\n            discontinuing of MSS recordings in 1987. The original processing\n            system, based on 16-bit minicomputers, was dismantled in early\n            1991. An alternative ingestion system is being developed to allow\n            limited processing of MSS data by the TM system, with a forecast to be\n            ready in late 1998.\n            \n            Meanwhile, available products are limited to reproduction of existing\n            photographic originals (about 150,000 black-and-white and color\n            images). No digital products can be delivered, since no copies were\n            kept from produced CCTs. Requests for products and for image search\n            listings are handled directly by the processing center (listed at the\n            Data Center entry), through contacts by mail, phone or fax. No online\n            remote access is available to the moment, although plans exist to\n            implement it, including the International Directory protocols. No firm\n            date is speculated for that, but hopes are that it can be made before\n            1998. Information about costs, delivery time and available formats can\n            be requested at the same address.",
