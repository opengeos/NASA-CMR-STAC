    "description": "CER_BDS_Aqua-FM3_Edition1-CV is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Bidirectional Scans (BDS) Aqua Flight Model 3 (FM3) Edition1-CV data product, which was collected using the CERES-FM3 instrument on the Aqua platform. This data product is intended only to be used for instrument validation purposes and is, therefore, not suited for science publications. Data collection for this product is ongoing. \r\n\r\nNote: Edition 1-CV data are only for instrument validation and not suited for science publications.\r\n\r\nEach CERES BDS data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1B data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft. BDS includes samples of normal and short Earth scan elevation profiles in fixed and rotating azimuth modes (including space, internal calibration, and solar calibration views). BDS contains Level-0 raw (unconverted) and the geolocated converted science and instrument data. BDS has additional data not found in the Level-0 input file, including converted satellite position and velocity data, celestial data converted digital status data, and parameters used in the radiance count conversion equations. CERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. \r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions follow the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, the protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
