    "description": "Recent construction for Interstate Highway 99 (I?99) exposed pyrite and\nassociated Zn-Pb sulfide minerals beneath a >10-m thick gossan to oxidative\nweathering along a 40-60-m deep roadcut through a 270-m long section of the\nOrdovician Bald Eagle Formation at Skytop, near State College, Centre County,\nPennsylvania. Nearby Zn-Pb deposits hosted in associated sandstone and\nlimestone in Blair and Centre Counties were prospected in the past; however,\nthese deposits generally were not viable as commercial mines. The pyritic\nsandstone from the roadcut was crushed and used locally as road base and fill\nfor adjoining segments of I?99. Within months, acidic (pH<3), metal-laden seeps\nand runoff from the exposed cut and crushed sandstone raised concerns about\nsurface- and ground-water contamination and prompted a halt in road\nconstruction and the beginning of costly remediation. Mineralized sandstones\nfrom the cut contain as much as 34 wt. % Fe, 28 wt. % S, 3.5 wt. % Zn, 1% wt.\nPb, 88 ppm As, and 32 ppm Cd. A composite of <2 mm material sampled from the\ncut face contains 8.1 wt. % total sulfide S, 0.6 wt. % sulfate S, and is net\nacidic by acid-base accounting (net neutralization potential ?234 kg CaCO3/t).\nPrimary sulfide minerals include pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite (2 to 12 wt. %\nFe) and traces of chalcopyrite and galena. Pyrite occurs in mm- to cm-scale\nveinlets and disseminated grains in sandstone, as needles, and in a locally\nmassive pyrite-cemented breccia along a fault. Inclusions (<10 ?m) of CdS and\nNi-Co-As minerals in pyrite and minor amounts of Cd in sphalerite (0.1 wt. % or\nless) explain the primary source of trace metals in the rock and in associated\nsecondary minerals and seepage. Wet/dry cycles associated with intermittent\nrainfall promoted oxidative weathering and dissolution of primary sulfides and\ntheir oxidation products. Resulting sulfate solutions evaporated during dry\nperiods to form intermittent ?blooms? of soluble, yellow and white efflorescent\nsulfate salts (copiapite, melanterite, and halotrichite) on exposed rock and\nother surfaces. Salts coating the cut face incorporated Fe, Al, S, and minor\nZn. They readily dissolved in deionized water in the laboratory to form\nsolutions with pH <2.5, consistent with field observations. In addition to\nelevated dissolved Fe and sulfate concentrations (>1,000 mg/L), seep waters at\nthe base of the cut contain >100 mg/L dissolved Zn and >1 mg/L As, Co, Cu, and\nNi. Lead is relatively immobile (<10 ?g/L in seep waters). The salts sequester\nmetals and acidity between rainfall events. Episodic salt dissolution then\ncontributes pulses of contamination including acid to surface runoff and ground\nwater. The Skytop experience highlights the need to understand dynamic\ninteractions of mineralogy and hydrology in order to avoid potentially negative\nenvironmental impacts associated with excavation in sulfidic rocks.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
