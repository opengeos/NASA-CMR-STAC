    "description": "Chemical, physical, profile and laboratory analysis oceanographic data were collected aboard the OCEAN VERITAS in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-06-13 to 2010-06-17 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include Attenuation/Transmission, CDOM fluorescence, Semivolatile Organic Compounds, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH), Volatile Organic Compounds, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, hydrostatic pressure, salinity, sound velocity, suspended solids, temperature and water density. The instruments used to collect these data included CTD, Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometer (LISST), Transmissometer, bottle, fluorometer and oxygen meter along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. The CTD data underwent preliminary quality assurance and control procedures at the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC). This data set also contains products created for use in real time analysis and decision support. These products may include charts, graphs, maps, plots, and GIS formatted data files. The analytical chemistry data are provisional and provide results of onshore laboratory analysis of water and sediment samples. Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers.
