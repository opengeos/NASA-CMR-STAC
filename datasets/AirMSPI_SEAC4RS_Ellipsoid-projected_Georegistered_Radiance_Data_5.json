    "description": "AirMSPI_SEAC4RS_Ellipsoid-projected_Georegistered_Radiance_Data are AirMSPI ellipsoid-projected georegistered radiance product acquired during the NASA SEAC4RS flight campaign.\nAirMSPI Level 1B2 products contain radiometric and polarimetric images of clouds, aerosols, and the surface of the Earth. In particular, products contain map-projected data at 8 wavelengths: 355, 380, 445, 470, 555, 660, 865, and 935 nm. The data products include radiance, time, solar zenith, solar azimuth, view zenith, and view azimuth for all spectral bands. Wavelengths for which polarization information is available (470, 660, and 865 nm) also include the Stokes parameters Q and U, as well as degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and angle of linear polarization (AOLP). Q, U, and AOLP are reported relative to both the scattering- and view meridian planes. Files are distributed in HDF-EOS-5 format.\nThis release of AirMSPI data contains all targets acquired during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) flight campaign. SEAC4RS was primarily based out of Ellington Field in Houston, Texas (initial flights were based out of Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, CA), and focused on clouds and aerosols in the United States. AirMSPI data were acquired from August 1 through September 23, 2013.",
