    "description": "The NARSTO_SOS_SC_UPSTATE_PM25_COMPOSITION data were collected during July 2001 and January of 2002 to elucidate the seasonal variability of the aerosols. Samples were collected at a rural location in South Carolina, beginning and ending at midnight in order to associate each sampling event with a calendar day. In all, 40 samples per month were collected (including blanks).The purpose of the study was to determine experimentally the concentration and chemical composition of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles with a diameter less than 2.5 um) in South Carolina. The collection of PM2.5 samples on Teflon filters was carried out using a cyclone-based system. Ion chromatography analysis for anions and cations was performed, as well as x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis for crustal metals. PM2.5 samples on quartz filters were also collected in order to determine the organic and elemental carbon (EC/OC) particle concentration.The average concentration for PM2.5 during July of 2001 was 20.85 mg/m3. The major components of the aerosol were organic compounds (38.5%) and sulfates (34.7%). During January of 2002, the average concentration for PM2.5 was 9.4 mg/m3. Again, the major components of the aerosol were organic compounds (64.1%) and sulfates (21.9%).NARSTO (formerly North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone) is a public/private partnership, whose membership spans government, the utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission is to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are available.",
