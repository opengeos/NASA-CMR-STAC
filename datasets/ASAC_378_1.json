    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 378\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\nFrom the abstract of the referenced paper:\n\nObservations on five groups of crabeater seals were conducted between 29 October and 17 November 1985 in the Antarctic pack ice near 66 degrees S 50 degrees E, off Enderby Land. The pups studied were born in the last half of October. Two of them increased in weight at a rate of approximately 4.2kg per day. The lactation period was 2-3 weeks and thus is one of the breifest among pinnipeds. Pups decreased in weight after weaning. The only pup visited after it left the natal floe must have been feeding, as it had only lost 2kg in a 10-day period during which it moved 13 km. Molt of lanugo appeared to be influenced by more a pups weight than by whether or not it was weaned.",
