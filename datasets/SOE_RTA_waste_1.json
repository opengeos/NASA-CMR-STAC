    "description": "INDICATOR DEFINITION\nThis indicator records the composition and weight of waste returned to Australia from Macquarie Island, Casey, Davis and Mawson stations. For the purposes of this indicator, waste is defined as materials that are no longer wanted, needed or used and which require treatment or disposal.\n\nTYPE OF INDICATOR\nThere are three types of indicators used in this report:\n1.Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system;\n2.Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system;\n3.Determine RESPONSES to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.\n\nThis indicator is one of: PRESSURE\n\nRATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION\nThe data will assist Australia in meeting Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, namely, to report annually on the steps taken to implement the Protocol. This indicator will also assist in monitoring the extent to which waste minimisation is occurring, and furthering planning and policy measures appropriate to efficient and effective waste management practices. The data may be a valuable tool in evaluating the environmental impacts of operational and scientific activities, and the extent of the community adoption and economics of recycling.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial scale: Australian Antarctic continental stations and Macquarie Island station.\n\nFrequency: Annual report.\n\nMeasurement technique: Data (waste weight and composition) are compiled from station cargo manifests and information supplied by the AAD's waste management contractor.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nAmount of incinerated waste,\nStation person days,\nField trips",
