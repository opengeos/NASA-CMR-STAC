    "description": "These data are the results of a series of laboratory-based toxicity tests in which earthworms were exposed soils that were spiked with a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds to mimic the existing contamination on Macquarie Island. Two series of experiments were done. The first used the earthworm Microscolex macquariensis which is native to Macquarie Island and soils from Macquarie Island. The second used the model test species Eisenia fetida and an artificial spiked soil. Eisenia fetida was further exposed to individual hydrocarbon compounds.\n\nThe effects of the hydrocarbons on worm survival, body mass, cocoon production, cocoon hatching success, aggregation behaviour and preference were recorded.",
