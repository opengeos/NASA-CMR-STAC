    "description": "This data set was created to display the topographic and administrative\nhydrographic area boundaries for the Humboldt River Basin at 1:24,000-scale.\n\nThis data set contains the topographic and administrative hydrographic area\nboundaries for the Humboldt River Basin at 1:24,000-scale.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe hydrographic area (HA) boundaries for the State of Nevada were delineated\non 1:250,000-scale maps, in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),\nand then redrawn and published at 1:500,000-scale (Cardinalli and others,\n1968). This 1:500,000-scale map is the current reference for HAs in Nevada and\nis used as a guide in delineating the HAs at 1:24,000-scale.\n\nThis data set contains the topographic and administrative HA boundaries for the\nHumboldt River Basin. The Humboldt River Basin HAs were delineated and\ndigitized from 1993 to 1998 using 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic maps.\n\nReviews\n\nThe digital data in this data base has gone through a rigorous, multi-level,\nquality-control process that ensures the data set is a fair representation of\nthe source map. If errors are encountered in this data set, it will be\nappreciated if the user would pass this information to the Metadata_Contact.\n\nTwo reviews were done. The reviewers were asked to check metadata and other\ndocumentation files for completeness and accuracy. Reviewers were asked to\ncheck the topological consistency, tolerances, projections, and geographic\nextent.\n\nNotes\n\nIt should be noted that, although the boundary lines between hydrographic areas\ngenerally coincide with true topographic basin divides, some of the lines are\narbitrary divisions that have no basis in topography, but are administrative\nand specified by Nevada Division of Water Resources.\n\nAny use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and\ndoes not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.\n\nAlthough this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata file is\nintended to document the data set in non-proprietary form, as well as in\nARC/INFO format, this metadata file may include some ARC/INFO-specific\nterminology.",
