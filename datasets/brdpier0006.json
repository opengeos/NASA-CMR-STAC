    "description": "Populations of the endangered Akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus) and Hawaii\nCreeper (Oreomystis mana) at four sites on the island of Hawaii.  Mean monthly\ndensity (+/-) of Akepa was 5.74 +/- 0.87, 1.35 +/-0.41, 0.96 +/- 0.13, and 0.76\n+/- 0.12 Akepa/ha at Kau Forest, Hamakua, Keauhou Ranch, and Kilauea Forest\nstudy areas, respectively. Hawaii creepers were found at densities of 1.68 +/-\n0.53, 1.79 +/- 0.42, 0.48 +/- 0.06, and 0.54 +/- 0.08 birds /ha, respectively ,\nat the four study areas.  Highest capture rates and numbers of birds counted\nfrom stations occurred from August through November and February through March.\n Hatching-year birds were captured from May through December for Akepa and\nApril through December for Hawaii Creeper.  Annual survival for adults at\nKeauhou Ranch was 0.70 +/- 0.27 SE fro 61 Akepa and 0.73 +/- 0.12 SE for 49\nHawaii Creepers. Lowest rates of mortality and emigration occurred between May\nand August.  Both species appeared to defend Type-B territories typical of\ncardueline finches, retained mates for more than one year, and showed strong\nphilopatry.  Home ranges for Hawaii Creepers ( x = 7.48 ha) were larger than\nthose for Akepa (x = 3.94 ha).  No difference was found between home range\nsizes of males and females for either species.\n\n   Geographic Description:\n   Hawaii Creepers and Akepa were studied at four sites on the island of\nHawaii.  The Keauhou Ranch study area (19.50, 155.33; 1800 m elevation) had a\ndiscontinuous canopy dominated by ohia and naio (Myoporum sandwicense) and had\na long history of grazing by cattle and logging for koa and ohia.  A 16-ha grid\nmarked at 50-m intervals was established at this wet (ca 2000 mm annual\nrainfall) forest site.  The 16-ha Kilauea Forest study area (19 .52, 155.32;\n1600-1650 m) was in a relatively pristine, closed-canopy, wet forest dominated\nby 20-30m tall koa and 15-25 m tall ohia trees, and was approximately 1.8 km NW\nof the Keauhou Ranch study area.  This site was described in detail by\nMueller-Dombois et al. (1981)..  The 50-ha Hamakua study area near mor\ncontinuous canopy and an almost complete lack of native understory plants\nbecause of intensive grazing by cattle The 50-ha Kau Forest study area (19.22,\n155.65; 1750 m) had a closed canopy of ohia and a largely ungrazed understory\nof kolea (Myrsine lessertiana), olapa (Cheirodendron trigynum), kawau (Ilex\nanomala), and native ferns. 1.5.2 Bounding Rectangle Coordinates\n\n   Methodology:\n   Estimated densities of Hawaii Creepers and Akepa at each of the four study\nareas by the variable circular-plot method (Reynolds et al. 1980, Ramsey and\nScott 1979) during eight min count periods as described in Ralph (1981).",
