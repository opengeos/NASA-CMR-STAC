    "description": "Fire in the south Florida landscape has historically been influential in shaping the ecosystem. The link between hydrology, soil formation, and fire is a critical complex component in the persistence of the biotic components of the Everglades (Smith et al 2003, Beckage 2005). As a result, Everglades National Park has been at the forefront of NPS fire policy development since the inception of the park. It was the first to allow prescribed burns and one of the first to develop a fire management plan (Taylor 1981). \nThe occurrence of invasive exotic plants has confounded the fire regime in Everglades National Park by changing the dynamics of how the vegetation burns. This phenomenon has been observed in mangrove forests especially along ecotones with upland vegetation communities. By examining the association between fire, soil, water and vegetation we can begin to understand the ecology and dynamics of these areas.",
