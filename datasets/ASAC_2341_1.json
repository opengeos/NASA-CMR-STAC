    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 2341.  See the link below for\npublic details on this project.\n\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nThis project aims to determine bacterial diversity in Antarctica, including non-culturable strains, by the use of various techniques. Soil, sediment and water samples will be collected from different sites e.g. relatively pristine sites, sites impacted by human activities, penguin rookeries. Isolation of bacteria from these samples will be carried out and isolates will be screened for special traits such as biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants (POP) or synthesis of biopolymers. Positive isolates will be compared with tropical bacteria isolates having similar abilities.\n\nSamples were collected from two Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the Casey area.  These were SSSI 16 and SSSI 17.  Samples were also collected from around Casey Station.  SSSI 16 and SSSI 17 are now known as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.  The new designation for SSSI 16 and 17 respectively is ASPA 135 and ASPA 136.\n\nThe following work was completed as part of this project:\n\n1) Obtained some bacteria isolates from antarctic soil and sediment, using common and selective microbiological media.\n2) From the micropore membranes, we extracted genomic DNA, PCR the 16S rRNA gene, cloned and sequence the gene to determine bacterial species.\n\nWater samples were filtered through micropore membranes to concentrate bacteria.\n\nThe download file contains data on bacterial diversity in meltlake water and sediment from two sites around Casey station, ASPA 135 and ASPA 136.\n\nASPA 135 meltlake (66.28251 degrees S, 110.54192 degrees E)\nTemperature 5.8 degrees C, pH 6.06, salinity 0\nSample collection date 27 December 2002\n\nASPA 136 meltlake (66.25131 degrees S, 110.53978 degrees E)\npH 7.35, salinity 2.8\nSample collection date 28 December 2002\n\nThe download files contain a series of accession numbers for the Genbank Database.  The actual data can be obtained from Genbank.",
