    "description": "Oceanographic measurements were collected aboard Aurora Australis cruise au1121, voyage \"Marine Science\" (i.e. voyage 2.1) 2010/2011, from 4th January to 6th February 2011.\n\nThe cruise commenced with a full north to south occupation of the CLIVAR/WOCE meridional repeat section SR3, followed by work around the Antarctic continental margin in the region of the Adelie Depression and the former Mertz Glacier ice tongue.\n\nA total of 149 CTD vertical profile stations were taken on the cruise, most to within 15 metres of the bottom. Over 2000 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate+nitrite and silicate), oxygen-18, dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. TCO2), alkalinity, pH, helium, tritium, and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Upper water column current profile data were collected by a ship mounted ADCP. Meteorological and water property data were collected by the array of ship's underway sensors. An array of 3 bottom mounted ADCP moorings were deployed near the Adelie Depression, for recovery in the 2012/13 season.\n\nUnderway data were also collected on this voyage, and are linked to this metadata record at the provided URL.  A detailed readme is available as part of the download.\n\nFinally, ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) data are also linked, and are in Matlab format.",
