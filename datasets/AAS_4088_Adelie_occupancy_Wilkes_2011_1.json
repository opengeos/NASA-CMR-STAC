    "description": "An occupancy survey on 21 January 2011 found a total of 7 islands along the Wilkes Land coastline had populations of breeding Adelie penguins. The survey was conducted from a fixed wing aircraft and oblique aerial photographs were taken of each occupied site except Haswell Island. The aerial photographs were geo-referenced to a satellite image and the boundaries of penguin colonies were digitised from the geo-referenced photos. Details for each island are:\n\nAdams:  Photographs taken on 21 January 2011 and geo-referenced to a Quickbird satellite image taken on 30 January 2009\nFulmar:  Photographs taken on 21 January 2011 and geo-referenced to a WorldView2 satellite image taken on 6 February 2011\nZykov: Photographs taken on 21 January 2011 and geo-referenced to a WorldView2 satellite image taken on 6 February 2011\nBuromskiy: Photographs taken on 21 January 2011 and geo-referenced to a WorldView2 satellite image taken on 6 February 2011\nStroitley: Photographs taken on 21 January 2011 and geo-referenced to a WorldView2 satellite image taken on 6 February 2011\nTokarev: Photographs taken on 21 January 2011 and geo-referenced to a WorldView2 satellite image taken on 6 February 2011\nHaswell:  No photographs taken, no penguin colonies were digitised\n\n\nNote there are two colony boundary layers in each folder except Adams. One is the original layer mapped as above. The second is an adjusted layer that was created so that the mapped boundaries would land on the exposed rock layer. Mapping of some of the islands contained within the coast layer had been coarsely done using imagery available at the time. Now with more accurate satellite imagery the island mapping could potentially be updated which would more accurately locate these islands. If this occurred, the original colony boundary mapping may be a more appropriate fit.    \n",
