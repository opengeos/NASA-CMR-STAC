    "description": "This research attempts to determine the role - CO2 source or sink - of the\nSouthern Ocean on a regional and seasonal scale by implementing an\nintegrated multidisciplinary approach which combines in situ\nmeasurements, studies of process in laboratory controlled conditions\nand numerical computation. It approaches the whole of the processes\nwhich govern the cycle of carbon in the Southern Ocean, from exchanges\nof CO2 at the air/sea interface until to accumulation of carbon in the\nsediments. It is based on a mechanistic scientific approach which aims\nat improving comprehension of the production process and of\nmineralisation of carbonated biomass in surface water as well as\nexport towards the deep ocean. In particular, the roles of light and the\navailability in nutrients (major and minor) in the determination of the\ndominant phytoplanktonic community, and thus of the dynamics of the\nassociated food chain and the carbon exportation, will be studied in\nareas dominated by various phytoplanktonic communities, namely the\ndiatoms, the colonies of Phaeocystis and the nanophytoplankton. The\nrole of aggregates as carbon conveyors, from surface to the deep water\nand the sediments, will be investigated with special attention to the\nfollowing processes : the bacterial mineralisation of aggregates and\nthe production and fate of the barite proxy.\n\nThe use of the barite as tracer of the exported carbon flux will be evaluated\nin order to improve the existing transfer functions. Acquired knowledge will\nthen be integrated in a 1D physical and biogeochemical model able to\nsimulate the cycle of carbon as well associated biogenic elements (N, Si,\nFe, Mn, Ba) in the whole water column of the Southern Ocean over a\nseasonal cycle. All together, this study will contribute to establish a\ndiagnostic and predictive model which will be used to evaluate the role\nof the Southern Ocean in a global perspective.",
