    "description": "The Antarctic Meteorological Research and Data Center (AMRDC) project will create an Antarctic meteorological observational data repository and archive system based on an open source platform to manage data from submission to end-user retrieval. The new archival system will host both currently available datasets and campaign meteorological datasets deposited by other Antarctic investigators. Both real-time meteorological data and archive data from the repository (e.g. Antarctic composite satellite imagery, AWS observations, etc.) will be accessible on a newly constructed website. The project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in order to provide them with meaningful experiences that can translate to any science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career path. Project participants and students will be involved in case studies, climatology reporting and development of whitepapers on related topics. The outcomes of this project revolve around data, and the students, researchers, and decision makers who all use and rely on Antarctic meteorological data. The AMRDC will not only be a resource for users, but it will also provide investigators a repository to place campaign datasets and meet NSF standards and requirements. This project also aims to give students Antarctic field experiences who are considering a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).",
