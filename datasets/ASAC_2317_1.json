    "description": "The project is a longterm monitoring program which commenced in 1980.  The aim was to monitor vegetation and erosion changes on Macquarie Island (tall tussock vegetation on the steep coastal slopes, erosion on the coastal slopes (landslips) and mid-altitude plateau) and document changes as a result of changing impacts from feral rabbits and, if possible, as a result of climate change.\n\nData sets consist of the following: 1. 27 vegetation monitoring sites set up in 1980 on steep coastal slopes around Macquarie Island, disturbed by landslipping and/or rabbit grazing, containing 200 permanent vegetation plots including 30 undisturbed control plots. 2. 48 erosion monitoring sites with varied origins and erosion histories set up in 1980 on mid-altitude plateau sites around Macquarie Island. 3. Two 5 x 5m rabbit exclusion plots set up in 1990 to monitor vegetation changes. 4. Series of photopoints along two sections of west coast set up to monitor large scale vegetation change resulting from changes in rabbit populations since 1980 (Mawson Point to Aurora Point, 7 km) and since 1990 (Davis Point to Cape Toutcher, 4 km). 5. Over 100 photopoints documenting changes in vegetation, erosion and landscape around Macquarie Island since 1980.\n\nThe download file consists of 12 excel spreadsheets and 2 word documents detailing the contents of the excel files.  These files are associated with part 1, detailed above '27 vegetation monitoring sites...'.\n\nThis project is an updated version of ASAC_76, 'Effects of Feral Rabbits, Native Fauna and Humans on Vegetation and Soil Stability, Macquarie Island'.  The project was continued in 2002-2003 under a new project number - 2317 (ASAC_2317) and new title - 'Longterm Changes in Vegetation and Soil Stability, Macquarie Island'. \n\nTaken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:\nProject objectives:\nThis project aims to resurvey long-term monitoring sites on Macquarie Island and ultimately document the recovery of ecosystems post-eradication of rabbits and rodents. The specific objectives of the project are:\n\n(1) Re-survey of steep coastal slopes. Re-measure sites established on Macquarie Island in 1980-81 to monitor changes in vegetation in 2008-09 (pre-eradication) and then in 2013-14 and 2018-19 (post-eradication).\n(2) Re-photograph two stretches of steep coastal slopes on the west coast, between Mawson Point and Aurora Point (7 km) and between Davis Point and Cape Toutcher (4 km) in 2008-09 (pre-eradication) and then in 2013-14 and 2018-19 (post-eradication).\n(3) Resurvey the known populations of the rare plant Poa litorosa at the south end of the island in 2008-09 (pre-eradication) and then in 2013-14 and 2018-19 (post-eradication). This objective is linked with the Poa litorosa monitoring objective of Project 1015.\n(4) Re-photograph over 100 fixed photo-points documenting the extent of vegetation, erosion and landscape change since 1980 in 2008-09 (pre-eradication) and then in 2013-14 and 2018-19 (post-eradication).\n\nProgress against objectives:\n(1) Fieldwork undertaken as proposed.\n(2) Fieldwork undertaken as proposed.\n(3) Fieldwork not undertaken.\n(4) Fieldwork undertaken as proposed.",
