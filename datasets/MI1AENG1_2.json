    "description": "MI1AENG1_2 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level 1A Engineering Data file Type 1 version 2. It is the Reformatted Annotated Level 1A product for the camera Engineering data, which represents indicators of sampled measurements for that MISR instrument. This product provides all of the data needed to describe the state of the instrument for Level 1 processing and analysis at a later date. These data are composed primarily of temperatures, voltages and currents of each camera, the optical bench, calibration diodes, and system electronics. Verification and reporting flags for latches and limit-switches on the cover/goniometer and the calibration diffuser panels are also incorporated into these data. The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.",
