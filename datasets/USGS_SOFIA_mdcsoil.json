    "description": "The data sets consist of two files, an ARC/INFO shape file with associated files and an export file, of a composite of soil maps for  Miami-Dade County, Florida issued by the Soil Conservation Service in April, 1958.  The data is at 1:40,000 scale.\n      \n      Getting geographic information into a form that can be analyzed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) has always been a labor-intensive process.  Graphic information was historically captured using variations of manual digitizing techniques.  Users either digitized directly from printed materials on digitizing tablets or tables or by a variation of heads-up digitizing from scanned graphics displayed on computer monitors. Data collection involves considerable interaction between the user and a computer to capture and manipulate graphical data into a GIS layers.  By using inexpensive image processing software to process and manipulate scanned images before processing these images in the GIS, features can be semi-automatically extracted from the scanned graphics, virtually eliminating the process of manual delineation.  Common photo editing techniques combined with GIS expertise can dramatically decrease the time required to collect GIS data layers.\n      \n      The mentioning of specific software brands or registered trademarks does not constitute a commercial endorsement; their mention is done for clarity only.  Mention of software products in the description of graphic processing techniques should be viewed as a use of available tools and not a recommendation for a software product.",
