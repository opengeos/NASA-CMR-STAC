This fuel is used for the main engines, and in some cases the generators.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial scale: Southern Ocean.\n\nFrequency: Monthly reports\n\nMeasurement technique: The figures are obtained by sounding the fuel tanks on the ship and/or a reading from the fuel usage meter.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nDepending on the vessels used by the Antarctic division, future collection of this data may be automated.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nSOE Indicator 1 - Monthly mean air temperatures at Australian Antarctic stations.\nSOE Indicator 2 - Highest monthly air temperatures at Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 3 - Lowest monthly air temperatures at Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 4 - Monthly mean lower stratospheric temperatures above Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 7 - Monthly mean of three-hourly wind speeds (m/s)\nSOE Indicator 48 - Station and ship person days\nSOE Indicator 57 - Monthly total of fuel used by station incinerators\nSOE Indicator 58 - Monthly total of fuel used by station vehicles\nSOE Indicator 59 - Monthly electricity usage\nSOE Indicator 60 - Total helicopter hours\nSOE Indicator 61 - Total potable water consumption\nSOE Indicator 65 - Station footprint for Australian Antarctic stations",
