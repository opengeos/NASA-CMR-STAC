    "description": "The purpose of the cell map is to display the exploration maturity,\ntype of production, and distribution of production in quarter-mile\ncells in each of the oil and gas plays and each of the provinces\ndefined for the 1995 U.S. National Oil and Gas Assessment.\n\n\nCell maps for each oil and gas play were created by the USGS as a\nmethod for illustrating the degree of exploration, type of production,\nand distribution of production in a play or province. Each cell\nrepresents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells\nare coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are\npredominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and\ngas-producing, or dry. The well information was initially retrieved\nfrom the Petroleum Information (PI) Well History Control System\n(WHCS), which is a proprietary, commercial database containing\ninformation for most oil and gas wells in the U.S.  Cells were\ndeveloped as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying\nproprietary WHCS data. No proprietary data are displayed or included\nin the cell maps. The data from WHCS were current as of December 1990\nwhen the cell maps were created in 1994.\n\n\nOil and gas plays within province 2 (Central Alaska) are listed here\nby play number, type, and name:\n\n   Number   Type           Name\n     201  conventional   Central Alaska Cenozoic Gas\n     202  conventional   Central Alaska Mesozoic Gas\n     203  conventional   Central Alaska Paleozoic Oil\n     204  conventional   Kandik Pre-Mid-Cretaceous Strata\n     205  conventional   Kandik Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary Non-Marine Stata",
