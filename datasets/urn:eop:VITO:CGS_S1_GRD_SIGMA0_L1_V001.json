    "description": "The Sigma0 product describes how much of the radar signal that was sent out by Sentinel-1 is reflected back to the sensor, and depends on the characteristics of the surface. This product is derived from the L1-GRD product. Typical SAR data processing, which produces level 1 images such as L1-GRD product, does not include radiometric corrections and significant radiometric bias remains. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the radiometric correction to SAR images so that the pixel values of the SAR images truly represent the radar backscatter of the reflecting surface. The radiometric correction is also necessary for the comparison of SAR images acquired with different sensors, or acquired from the same sensor but at different times, in different modes, or processed by different processors. For this Sigma0 product, radiometric calibration was performed using a specific Look Up Table (LUT) that is provided with each original GRD product. This LUT applies a range-dependent gain including the absolute calibration constant, in addition to a constant offset. Next to calibration, also orbit correction, border noise removal, thermal noise removal, and range doppler terrain correction steps were applied during production of Sigma0. The terrain correction step is intended to compensate for distortions due to topographical variations of the scene and the tilt of the satellite sensor, so that the geometric representation of the image will be as close as possible to the real world.",
