    "description": "The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general circulation models (GCMs). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud data. To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 - July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992). Each mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical processes of the cloud systems.These data were collected by the University of Utrecht (The Netherlands) during ASTEX experimental campaign, June 1992, at the surface site of Santa Maria (36.99 N; 25.17W; ASL=50M).Every file contains the following variables:-time (UTC): Universal Time Coordinated time.Data were taken every 2 minutes.-T6(C): Temperature at 6 meters.Accuracy of the temperature sensor 0.2 C-T2(C): Temperature at 2 meters.Accuracy of the temperature sensor 0.2 C-rh6(%): Relative humidity at 6 meters.Accuracy of the relative humidity sensor 2 %.Above 90% the measurements are less accurate.Highest value measured by the sensor: 95%.-rh2(%): Relative humidity at 2 meters. Accuracy of the relative humidity sensor 2 %.Above 90% the measurements lose accuracy.Highest value measured by the sensor: 99%.-ff6(m/s) Wind speed at 6 meters.Accuracy of the sensor 0.2 m/s.-dd(deg) Wind direction at 6 meters.Accuracy of the sensor 4 deg.-fsin(W/m2) Incoming shortwave radiation at 1.5 meters.Pyranometer measures the irradiance between 305 to 2800 nm with a precision 2 W/m2.-fsou(W/m2) Outcoming shortwave radiation at 1.5 meters.Pyranometer measures the irradiance between 305 to 2800 nm with a precision 2 W/m2.",
