Close to the coast in some regions (e.g. near Mawson and Davis stations) this ice remains fastened to the land throughout the winter and is called fast ice.\n\nThe thickness and growth rate of fast ice are determined purely by energy exchanges at the air-ice and ice-water interfaces.  This contrasts with moving pack ice where deformational processes of rafting and ridging also determine the ice thickness.  The maximum thickness that the fast ice reaches, and the date on which it reaches that maximum, represent an integration of the atmospheric and oceanic conditions.\n\nChanges in ice thickness represent changes in either oceanic or atmospheric heat transfer. Thicker fast ice reflects either a decrease in air temperature or decreasing oceanic heat flux. These effects can be extrapolated to encompass large-scale ocean-atmosphere processes and potentially, global climate change.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial Scale: At sites near Australian Antarctic continental stations: Davis; Mawson.\n\nFrequency: at least weekly, reported annually\n\nMeasurement Technique:  Tape measurements through freshly drilled 5 cm diameter holes in the ice at marked sites.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nTo more effectively analyse the changes in Antarctic fast ice a detailed long-term dataset of sea ice conditions needs to be established. This would provide a baseline for future comparisons and contribute important data for climate modelling and aid the detection of changes that may occur due to climate or environmental change.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nSOE Indicator 1 - Monthly mean air temperatures at Australian Antarctic stations\nSOE Indicator 40 - Average sea surface temperatures in latitude bands 40-50oS, 50-60oS, 60oS-continent\nSOE Indicator 41 - Average sea surface salinity in latitude bands: 40-50oS, 50-60oS, 60oS-continent\nSOE Indicator 42 - Antarctic sea ice extent and concentration\n\nThe fast ice data are also available as a direct download via the url given below.  The data are in word documents, and are divided up by year and site (there are three sites (a,b,c) at each station).  Snow thickness data have also been included.  A pdf document detailing how the observations are collected is also available for download.",
