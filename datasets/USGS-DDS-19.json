    "description": "PROJECT OVERVIEW\n\nConversion of the information from the original folio to a computerized \ndigital format was undertaken to facilitate the presentation and analysis of\nearth-science data.  Digital maps can be displayed at any scale or \nprojection, whereas a paper map has a fixed scale and projection.  However, \nmost of the maps on this disc are not intended to be used at any scale more \ndetailed than 1:500,000.  \n\nA geographic information system (GIS) allows combining and overlaying of \nlayers for analysis of spatial relations not readily apparent in the \nstandard paper publication.  Digital information on geology, geophysics, and\ngeochemistry can be combined to create useful derivative products.\n\nHISTORY OF THE MAPS\n\nIn 1986 and 1987, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Direcci&oacuten \nGeneral de Geolog&iacutea, Minas e Hidrocarburos, and the Universidad de Costa \nRica conducted a mineral-resource assessment of the Republic of Costa Rica. \nThe results were published as a large 80- by 50-cm color folio (U.S.\nGeological Survey and others, 1987).  The 75-page document consists of maps \nas well as descriptive and interpretive text in English and Spanish covering\nphysiographic, geologic, geochemical, geophysical, and mineral site themes\nas well as a mineral-resource assessment.  The following maps are present in\nthe original folio:\n\n   1) Physiographic base map at a scale of 1:500,000 with hypsography, \n           place names, and drainage.\n   2) Geologic map at a scale of 1:500,000.\n   3) Regional geophysical maps, including gravity, aeromagnetic, and \n           seismicity maps at various scales.\n   4) Mineral sites map at a scale of 1:500,000 showing mines, prospects, \n           and occurrences.\n   5) Volcanological framework of the Tilar&aacuten region important for \n           epithermal gold deposits at a scale of 1:100,000.\n   6) Rock sample locations, mining areas, and vein locations for several \n           parts of the country.\n   7) Permissive areas delineated for selected mineral deposit types.\n   8) Digital elevation model.\n\nThis CD-ROM contains most of the above maps; it lacks items 1 and 8 and \nthe seismicity and aeromagnetic maps of item 3.  The linework was digitized \nfrom preliminary and printed maps with GSMAP (Selner and Taylor, 1987), a \nUSGS-authored program for map editing and publishing.  Conversion from GSMAP\nto ARC/INFO was accomplished through the use of the GSMARC program (Green \nand Selner, 1988).  The arcs and polygons were tagged using Alacarte \n(Wentworth and Fitzgibbon, 1991).  \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
