PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDS\n(sets to be made available to AAD multimedia centre for permanent record)\n\n1a Glacier margin positions\nAerial oblique and some ground-based photographs\n\n1b Summit crater of Big Ben\nAerial oblique photographs\n\n1c Environmental impacts of research\nGround-based photographs of research excavation sites (before excavation, during excavation, after rehabilitation, GPS locations) \n\n2. TOPOGRAPHIC PROFILES\n\n2a Intended long term coastal monitoring sites\nSimple profiles from permanent markers (with GPS) compiled from compas and clinometer traverses (amply detailed to capture changes at the scales being observed and simple to repeat)\n\n2b Beach profiles\nSimple profiles compiled from clinometer and tape traverses to characterise selected beaches as part of geomorphological survey; GPS locations\n\n2c. Dovers Moraine profiles\nSimple profiles compiled from clinometer, compass and tape traverses to characterise ridge sequence and establish approximate altitude of palaeolake shorelines; some GPS locations.\n\nDetails are given in the spreadsheet at the url below.\n\n3. GLACIAL LANDFORMS AND RELATIVE DATING\n\n3a Reconnaissance-level landform survey\nMorphostratigraphic relationships between landforms recorded in note form, photographically, or directly onto field maps; by estimation with some GPS control.\n\n3b Criteria for relative dating\nSemiquantitative data on moraine morphology; descriptive data on subsurface weathering status; GPS locations\n\n3c Sampling\nSamples obtained for laboratory analysis (mechanical and chemical analysis and some radiometric dating - processing will be dependent upon obtaining adequate financial resources; GPS locations; samples, sampling sites and desired use as indicated in the spreadsheet at the url below.\n\nThe downloadable dataset contains:\n\n1. Photographic record of glacier margins and summit of Big Ben as at December 2000\n2. Simple topographic profiles of eroding coastlines for long term monitoring processes, selected beach profiles and profiles over Dovers Moraine\n3. Data on glacial geomorphology and glacial geology including postdepositional modification of moraines and glacial sediments and samples for weathering studies and possible radiometric dating.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nnorthing\neasting\nheight (ASL)\nlocation\nsample number\nsample type\nsample date\nlongitude\nlatitude\nlandform\ngeneral profile\nweathering and sediment stratigraphy\nsampling\nphotographs",
