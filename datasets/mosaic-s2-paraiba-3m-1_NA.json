    "description": "Sentinel-2 image mosaic of Brazilian Para\u00edba State with 10m of spatial resolution. The mosaic was prepared to support the partnership between the INPE's Health Information Investigation Laboratory (LiSS) and the Federal University of Para\u00edba's Public Policy Studies Program for Early Childhood Education (NEPPS) by supporting the development of the COVID 19/PB Platform: Relations between Health, Territory and Social Protection in times of sanitary crisis, which created the Platform Covid-19/Para\u00edba: Social and Health Indicator Observatory for SUS and SUAS management. The false color composition is based on the MSI bands 8, 4 and 3 assigned to RGB channels. The temporal composition encompasses 03-months of images, starting in November 2019 and ending in January 2020, with a best pixel selection approach called Least Cloud Cover First (LCF). More information on LCF can be found at Brazil Data Cube web site (https://brazil-data-cube.github.io/specifications/processing-flow.html#temporal-compositing). This Image Mosaic used more than 800 Sentinel-2 scenes and was generated based on an existing Sentinel-2 image collection.",
