    "description": "Preliminary Metadata record for data expected from ASAC Project 999\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nLarge numbers of insects, mites, spiders and other biological material are transported southwards from source areas across southern Australia on warm prefrontal airflows moving at 100 km/h or more which develop ahead of eastward moving cold fronts centred over the Southern Oceans. Migrating invertebrates need to remain airborne for only 18-24 hours to be transported from Australia to Macquarie Island.  This project involves the use of invertebrate traps (mainly wind traps and light traps) to  monitor transfers of biological material between continental land masses and sub-Antarctic Macquarie and Heard Islands, and theoretical consideration and modelling of meteorological parameters governing these transfers. The project extends to monitoring of dispersal on, and colonisation of, sub-Antarctic Macquarie and Heard islands by invertebrate animals, including those introduced by human activities.\n\nSome data are available for this project.  Such data are attached to this metadata record via the related URL section.  The data that is available was compiled for archival by Penny Greenslade.  Some of the collected invertebrate samples from the island are available in the Queen Victoria Museum in Launceston, Tasmania.\n\nThe following datasets (and their fields) are currently available.\n\nLocation of nematode sampling sites\n\nLocation\nSampled in 1951\nSample Number\nEast\nWest\n\nNote - this dataset also refers to work completed by Bunt in 1951 (see metadata record 'The Soil Inhabiting Nematodes of Macquarie Island'). Furthermore, the nematode dataset has become 'confused' with time, and the meaning of some of the columns is not clear.\n\nLocation of oligochaete sampling sites\n\nDate\nTime\nSite\nLocation\nLatitude\nLongitude\nVegetation\nSample\nComments",
