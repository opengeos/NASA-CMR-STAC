    "description": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a cooperative program of the U.S.\nGeological Survey, the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska\nFairbanks, and the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, has\nmaintained seismic monitoring networks at historically active volcanoes in\nAlaska since 1988 (Power and others, 1993; Jolly and others, 1996; Jolly and\nothers, 2001; Dixon and others, 2002). The primary objectives of this program\nare the seismic monitoring of active, potentially hazardous, Alaskan volcanoes\nand the investigation of seismic processes associated with active volcanism.\nThis catalog presents the basic seismic data and changes in the seismic\nmonitoring program for the period January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002.\nAppendix G contains a list of publications pertaining to seismicity of Alaskan\nvolcanoes based on these and previously recorded data. The AVO seismic network\nwas used to monitor twenty-four volcanoes in real time in 2002. These include\nMount Wrangell, Mount Spurr, Redoubt Volcano, Iliamna Volcano, Augustine\nVolcano, Katmai Volcanic Group (Snowy Mountain, Mount Griggs, Mount Katmai,\nNovarupta, Trident Volcano, Mount Mageik, Mount Martin), Aniakchak Crater,\nMount Veniaminof, Pavlof Volcano, Mount Dutton, Isanotski Peaks, Shishaldin\nVolcano, Fisher Caldera, Westdahl Peak, Akutan Peak, Makushin Volcano, Great\nSitkin Volcano, and Kanaga Volcano (Figure 1). Monitoring highlights in 2002\ninclude an earthquake swarm at Great Sitkin Volcano in May-June; an earthquake\nswarm near Snowy Mountain in July-September; low frequency (1-3 Hz) tremor and\nlong-period events at Mount Veniaminof in September-October and in December;\nand continuing volcanogenic seismic swarms at Shishaldin Volcano throughout the\nyear. Instrumentation and data acquisition highlights in 2002 were the\ninstallation of a subnetwork on Okmok Volcano, the establishment of telemetry\nfor the Mount Veniaminof subnetwork, and the change in the data acquisition\nsystem to an EARTHWORM detection system. AVO located 7430 earthquakes during\n2002 in the vicinity of the monitored volcanoes. This catalog includes: (1) a\ndescription of instruments deployed in the field and their locations; (2) a\ndescription of earthquake detection, recording, analysis, and data archival\nsystems; (3) a description of velocity models used for earthquake locations;\n(4) a summary of earthquakes located in 2002; and (5) an accompanying UNIX\ntar-file with a summary of earthquake origin times, hypocenters, magnitudes,\nand location quality statistics; daily station usage statistics; and all\nHYPOELLIPSE files used to determine the earthquake locations in 2002.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
