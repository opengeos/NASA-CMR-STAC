    "description": "We present stated preference data based on a national representative Swiss online panel survey for the preference of renewable energy infrastructure in landscapes. The data was collected between November 2018 to March 2019 using an online questionnaire and resulted on 1026 responses. The online questionnaire consisted of two main parts \u2013 (1) questions covering meanings related to landscapes, nature and renewable energy infrastructure, including the \u201cfit\u201d of landscape/REI combinations and (2) online choice experiment. While in the first part of the questionnaire we asked respondents about their personal connection to certain landscapes, to nature and to specific renewable energy infrastructures, we also asked them to evaluate the fitting of seven different Swiss landscapes (near natural alpine areas, northern alps, touristic alpine areas, agricultural plateau, urban plateau, jura ridges, urban alpine valley) with five different REI (wind, PV ground, PV roof, power lines) combinations. In the second part of the questionnaire, the stated choice experiment confronted respondents with 15 consecutive choice tasks, with each task involving a choice between two \u201cenergy system transformation\u201d options and an opt-out option (none). Each choice option (beside the opt-out option) included four unlabeled attributes (landscape, wind energy infrastructure, photovoltaic energy infrastructure, high voltage overhead power line infrastructure) with varying levels. Due to data cleaning procedures (item nonresponse) the number of responses used within hybrid choice modelling and analysis was n=844 (12660 choice observations). An analysis of the hybrid choice model and further insights are presented in the article \u201cHow landscape-technology fit affects public evaluations of renewable energy infrastructure scenarios. A hybrid choice model.\u201d",
