    "description": "This data set contains all of the elevation points used to model the ground\nsurface in Pool 2A at the Ottawa National\nWildlife Refuge.\n\nOver 95% of the original wetland habitats along the U.S. shoreline of western\nLake Erie have been lost since the 1860s.  Most of the remaining coastal\nwetlands have been isolated by earthen dikes and no longer provide many of the\nfunctions of coastal wetlands (e.g., fish habitat).  Unfortunately, most of the\nfew remaining undiked wetlands are severely degraded.  They remain\nhydrologically connected to the lake, but the wetland vegetation that provides\nvital fish habitat is sufficiently degraded to negatively impact the\napproximately 43 species of Great Lakes fish that use wetland habitats.  The\n2003 EPA project initiated the restoration of the drowned-river mouth wetlands\nat Crane Creek, a small stream flowing into western Lake Erie.  Since\nhistorical descriptions of the study site suggest a much broader expanse of\nwetlands than just the 345 ha (852 ac) in and near the Crane Creek channel, the\ndiked wetlands bordering the creek were examined to evaluate options for\nlong-term ecological restoration.  The research focused on both reestablishing\nwetland vegetation near Crane Creek and exploring whether diked wetlands can be\nfunctionally restored by hydrologically reconnecting them to Lake Erie,\neffectively adding habitat to the lake.  This work addressed many of the high\npriority research areas identified by the 1998 EPA Science Advisory Board\nreport on marsh management and restored critical coastal wetland habitat,\nidentified as a special focus area in the Great Lakes Strategy and recently\nidentified as a priority by the Council of Great Lakes Governors.  One aspect\nof this research was to characterize the bathymetry and topography throughout\nthe wetland complex. \n\nThis data set was used to generate a topographic/bathymetric surface that will\nallow modelling of different biotic and abiotic conditions.",
