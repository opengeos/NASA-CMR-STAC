    "description": "The Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Level 1 Precision Terrain Corrected Registered At-Sensor Radiance (AST_L1T) data contains calibrated at-sensor radiance, which corresponds with the ASTER Level 1B ([AST_L1B](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1B.004)) that has been geometrically corrected and rotated to a north-up UTM projection. The AST_L1T is created from a single resampling of the corresponding ASTER L1A ([AST_L1A](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.004)) product. The bands available in the AST_L1T depend on the bands in the AST_L1A and can include up to three Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) bands, six Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands, and five Thermal Infrared (TIR) bands. The AST_L1T dataset does not include the aft-looking VNIR band 3. The AST_L1T product has a spatial resolution of 15 meters (m) for the VNIR bands, 30 m for the SWIR bands, and 90 m for the TIR bands.\n\nThe precision terrain correction process incorporates GLS2000 digital elevation data with derived ground control points (GCPs) to achieve topographic accuracy for all daytime scenes where correlation statistics reach a minimum threshold. Alternate levels of correction are possible (systematic terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that otherwise represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g., cloud cover).\n\nFor daytime images, if the VNIR or SWIR telescope collected data and precision correction was attempted, each precision terrain corrected image will have an accompanying independent quality assessment. It will include the geometric correction available for distribution as both a text file and single band browse images with the valid GCPs overlaid.\n\nThis multi-file product also includes georeferenced full resolution browse images. The number of browse images and the band combinations of the images depends on the bands available in the corresponding [AST_L1A](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.004) dataset.\n\nKnown Issues\n* TIR bands: Acquisitions for TIR bands ended on January 16, 2026, at 05:10:45 UTC, when the ASTER TIR instrument was permanently turned off due to power limitations on the Terra spacecraft. More information is available in this [NASA Science News Brief](https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/science-news/2026/02/12/terra-adjusts-instrument-operations-to-extend-mission-life/).\n* Data acquisition gaps: On November 28, 2024, one of Terra's power-transmitting shunt units failed. As a result, there was insufficient power to maintain functionality of the ASTER instrument. ASTER resumed acquisitions for the VNIR bands on January 18, 2025, and for the TIR bands on April 15, 2025. Users should note the data gap in ASTER acquisitions from November 28, 2024, through January 16, 2025, for VNIR observations, and a gap from November 28, 2024, through April 15, 2025, for TIR acquisitions.\n* Zero values: Since October 1, 2017, a correction addresses zero-filled scans in low-latitude, ascending orbit (nighttime) TIR data. Additional details are available in the [ASTER L1T User Advisory](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/191/ASTER_L1T_User_Advisory_May_11_17.pdf).\n* SWIR bands: ASTER SWIR detectors are no longer functioning as of January 12, 2009, due to anomalously high SWIR detector temperatures.\n* SWIR anomaly: Users are advised that ASTER SWIR data acquired from April 2008 to January 11, 2009, exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer to the [ASTER SWIR User Advisory](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1661/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_Jan_12_2009.pdf) for more details.\n",
