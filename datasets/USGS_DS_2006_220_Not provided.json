    "description": "Pressure transducers and high-water marks were used to document the inland\nwater levels related to storm surge generated by Hurricane Rita in southwestern\nLouisiana and southeastern Texas. On September 22-23, 2005, an experimental\nmonitoring network consisting of 47 pressure transducers (sensors) was deployed\nat 33 sites over an area of about 4,000 square miles to record the timing,\nextent, and magnitude of inland hurricane storm surge and coastal flooding.\nSensors were programmed to record date and time, temperature, and barometric or\nwater pressure. Water pressure was corrected for changes in barometric pressure\nand salinity. Elevation surveys using global-positioning systems and\ndifferential levels were used to relate all storm-surge water-level data,\nreference marks, benchmarks, sensor measuring points, and high-water marks to\nthe North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). The resulting data\nindicated that storm-surge water levels over 14 feet above NAVD 88 occurred at\nthree locations and rates of water-level rise greater than 5 feet per hour\noccurred at three locations near the Louisiana coast.\n\nQuality-assurance measures were used to assess the variability and accuracy of\nthe water-level data recorded by the sensors. Water-level data from sensors\nwere similar to data from co-located sensors, permanent U.S. Geological Survey\nstreamgages, and water-surface elevations performed by field staff. Water-level\ndata from sensors at selected locations were compared to corresponding\nhigh-water mark elevations. In general, the water-level data from sensors were\nsimilar to elevations of high quality high-water marks, while reporting\nconsistently higher than elevations of lesser quality high-water marks.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
