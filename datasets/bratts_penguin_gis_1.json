    "description": "Aerial photography (35mm film) of penguin colonies was acquired over some islands north east of Brattstrand Bluff islands (Eric Woehler).\nThe penguin colonies were traced, then digitised (John Cox), and saved as DXF-files.\nUsing the ArcView extension 'Register and Transform' (Tom Velthuis), The DXF-files were brought into a GIS and transformed to the appropriate islands.\n\nUpdate May 2015 - \nThis dataset has been rename from \"Brattstrand Bluff penguin GIS dataset\" to \"Islands NE of Brattstrand Bluff penguin GIS dataset\" to better describe the location of the colonies. The penguin colonies are on a small group of islands approximately 12km north east of Brattstrand Bluff. Latitude 69.148 south and longitude 77.268 east.\nThe Data Centre does not have a copy of the original photographs or described GIS data. In May 2015, the Data Centre has attached the following to this record:\nThe DXF file produced by John Cox by digitising the aerial photography. Note this document is not georeferenced.\nFour photographs taken in 2009 by Barbara Wienecke, Seabird Ecologist, showing penguin colonies on these islands.\nA shapefile exists of the digitised colonies. The digitising by Ursula Harris, Australian Antarctic Data Centre, was done by georeferencing the DXF drawing over unprocessed Quickbird Image 05NOV15042413-M1BS-052187281010_01_P002. It was done in two parts, the largest island and then the two smaller islands. This allowed for better matching. The accuracy of this data is unknown.",
