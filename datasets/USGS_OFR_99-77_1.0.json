    "description": "This report contains digital data sets describing principal aquifers, surficial\ngeology, and ground-water regions of the conterminous United States. The data\nsource for the principal aquifers and surficial geology data sets is \"The\nNational Atlas of the United States of America\" (U.S. Geological Survey, 1970;\nHunt, 1979). The data source for the ground-water regions data set is\n\"Ground-Water Regions of the United States\" by Heath (1984). Some of the\ndigital lines describing coastlines were modified from U.S. Geological Survey\nboundary information (U.S. Geological Survey, 1990; Lanfear, 1984). Because\nmost of the source materials do not cover Alaska and Hawaii, only the\nconterminous 48 states are included in these data sets.\n\nCompilation of the data sets was supported by the National Water-Quality\nAssessment (NAWQA) Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The objectives\nof the NAWQA Program are to: (1) describe current water-quality conditions for\na large part of the Nation's freshwater streams, rivers, and aquifers, (2)\ndescribe how water quality is changing over time, and (3) improve the\nunderstanding of the primary natural and anthropogenic factors that affect\nwater-quality conditions. National analysis of data, based on aggregation of\ncomparable information obtained from across the United States, is a major\ncomponent of the NAWQA Program. The data sets included in this report were\ncreated in support of NAWQA national data analysis activities.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
