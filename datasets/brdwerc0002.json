    "description": "The larger Sierra Nevada Global Change Research Program (SNGCRP) seeks to\nunderstand past, present, and possible future changes in Sierran forest\nstructure, composition, and dynamics resulting from changing management\npractices and anticipated global climate change. Within the larger program,\nthis project (\"Comparison of the sedimentary record of fire with the tree-ring\nrecord within and near giant sequoia groves, Sierra Nevada, California\") will\nuse high precision carbon dating of charcoal and pollen in sediment cores in\norder to (1) develop a 10,000-year record of fire history in the southern and\ncentral Sierra Nevada, calibrated against multi-millennial, annual-resolution\nfire histories from tree rings at the same sites, and (2) develop detailed\ndescriptions of changes in forest composition over the last few millennia, to\nbe compared with climate and fire histories developed by other SNGCRP projects.\nThis work will provide data for calibration and testing of fire spread and\nforest dynamics models currently being developed by other global change\nresearch projects, and will provide baseline data on past disturbance regimes,\ntheir variability, and consequent forest response. These objectives will be\nachieved by analyzing four sediment cores. The cores have already been\ncollected from meadows adjacent to sites with multi-millennial,\nannual-resolution fire histories developed from giant sequoia tree rings: Giant\nForest (Sequoia National Park), Mountain Home Grove (Mountain Home State\nForest), Mariposa Grove (Yosemite National Park), and Big Stump Grove (Kings\nCanyon National Park).",
