    "description": "Recently, concerns about declining stocks of endangered anadromous salmonids in\nthe Columbia River basin raised the issue of restoration of riverine functions\nin this and other Columbia and Snake River reservoirs (ISG, 2000; Dauble and\nothers, 2003). One option for restoration of riverine functions includes\nlowering water levels within selected reservoirs such as the John Day\nReservoir. Questions about how much sediment has been trapped by this dam\nwarranted a detailed study of the floor of the reservoir to assess changes that\nhad occurred since impoundment. High-resolution geophysical mapping techniques\nwere employed to provide, to our knowledge, the first detailed view of the\nfloor of the reservoir since its formation. This geophysical \"road map\" in\nconcert with bottom video images, some sediment samples, and historical data\ncollected prior to creation of the reservoir were incorporated into a GIS. The\nsubsequent text summarizes the techniques used in this study. It also provides\na preliminary analysis of the results and a background for the GIS that\naccompanies this report.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
