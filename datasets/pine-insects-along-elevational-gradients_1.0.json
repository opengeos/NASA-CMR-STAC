    "description": "The colonization of cut pine stems by wood-inhabiting insects was investigated at various elevations. The study sites were located in the regions of Aosta Valley (Italy), Valais (Switzerland), and Grisons (Switzerland). In each region, there were two gradients in pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests, with three study sites at 900 m, 1200 m, and 1600 m a.s.l. each. Vital trees were felled in late autumn and the stems were colonized by pioneering xylophagous insects and their natural enemies next spring. Pieces of these stems were cut and exposed in emergence traps in a greenhouse. In each region the survey was done in two consecutive years.    Please contact author for terms of use.",
