    "description": "The USGS reports chemical and isotopic analyses of 345 water samples collected\nfrom the Osage-Skiatook Petroleum Environmental Research (OSPER) project. Water\nsamples were collected as part of an ongoing multi-year USGS investigation to\nstudy the transport, fate, natural attenuation, and ecosystem impacts of\ninorganic salts and organic compounds present in produced water releases at two\noil and gas production sites from an aging petroleum field located in Osage\nCounty, in northeast Oklahoma. The water samples were collected primarily from\nmonitoring wells and surface waters at the two research sites, OSPER A (legacy\nsite) and OSPER B (active site), during the period March, 2001 to February,\n2005. The data include produced water samples taken from seven active oil\nwells, one coal-bed methane well and two domestic groundwater wells in the\nvicinity of the OSPER sites.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
