    "description": "This spreadsheet contains species lists and counts from four sediment trap records. The sediment traps were deployed for ~1 year north and south of the Chatham Rise, New Zealand, between 1996 and 1997. Sheets 1a and 1b refer to North Chatham Rise (NCR). 1a = the 300m trap. 1b = the 1000m trap. Sheets 2a and 2b are for the South Chatham Rise traps (SCR). 2a= 300m, 2b= 1000m. \n\nCounting was undertaken on 1/16th splits. Material was cleaned of organics before diatom counting under light microscopy. Coccolith counting on uncleaned material was only undertaken at the 300m traps. Radiolarians and silicoflagellates were counted but not identified. Diatoms and coccoliths were counted along non-overlapping transects until 300 specimens had been counted per sample, or until 10 transects had been made.\n\nThis dataset includes counts of diatom, coccolithophores, radiolarians and silicoflagellates for four sediment trap records- North Chatham Rise (NCR) and South Chatham Rise (SCR) at two trap depths each (300 m and 1000 m). It is intended as supplementary material to Wilks et al. 2018 (submitted) \"Diatom and coccolithophore assemblages from archival sediment trap samples of the Subtropical and Subantarctic Southwest Pacific.\"\n\nNumbers are raw count per sample cup. Authorities are given. Coordinates of traps given in degrees, minutes and seconds.",
