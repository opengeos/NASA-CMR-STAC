    "description": "This WorldView-2 image of the east coast of Heard Island was collected on 23 Dec. 2010. (Satellite Image Catalogue id=2262 and 2263) The 0.5 m resolution panchromatic band and 2 m resolution multispectral bands were separately orthorectified and two separate image tiles were mosaiced.\n\nThe images are the result of a rigorous orthorectification of the panchromatic band and eight multispectral bands of the two WorldView-2 images. The images were orthorectified with the TerraSAR-X DEM acquired in Oct 2009.  The digital elevation model used in the orthrectification is described by the metadata record 'A Digital Elevation Model of Heard Island derived from TerraSAR satellite imagery' - Entry ID: heard_dem_terrasar\n\nThe orthorectification of the two Worldview-2 image tiles was carried out in ENVI 4.8. No GCPs were used for the orthorectification process given the very high absolute accuracy of the RPC positioning of WorldView-2. Previously problems were encountered (significant geometric errors) with orthorectification of IKONOS 2004 imagery with DGPS GCPs collected by Dr Jenny Scott. The current orthorectification is considered more accurate given the high absolute spatial accuracy of WorldView-2 (CE90 = 3.5 m) and the more detailed TerraSAR-X DEM of Heard Island. The resulting image is considered a base image for subsequent geometric processing and co-registration of other images (e.g. IKONOS image acquired in 2004 for change detection).\n\nThe two tiles were mosaiced along a manually digitised cutline in ENVI. For a more detailed description of this process we refer to the report available for download from the provided URL.\n\nPersonnel involved with this dataset.\nDr Arko Lucieer (principal investigator)\nIain Clarke (research assistant: geometric corrections)\nDesiree Treichler (research assistant: radiometric and atmospheric corrections)",
