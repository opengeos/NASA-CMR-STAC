    "description": "Pulley Ridge is a series of drowned barrier islands that extend over 100 km in\n60-100 m water depths. This drowned ridge is located on the Florida Platform in\nthe southeastern Gulf of Mexico about 250 km west of Cape Sable, Florida\n(Halley and others, 2003). This barrier island chain formed during the initial\nstage of the Holocene marine transgression approximately 7000 years before\npresent. These islands were then submerged and left abandoned near the outer\nedge of the Florida Platform. The southern portion of Pulley Ridge, the focus\nof this study, hosts zooxanthellate scleractinian corals, green, red and brown\nmacro algae, and a mix of deep and typically shallow-water tropical fishes.\nThis largely photosynthetic community is unique in that it thrives with only 5%\nof the light typically associated with shallow-water reefs with similar fauna.\n\nSeveral factors help to account for the existence of this unique deep-water\ncommunity. First, the underlying drowned barrier island provides both elevated\ntopography and lithified substrate for the establishment of the hardbottom\ncommunity. Second, the region is dominated by the west edge of the Loop\nCurrent, which brings relatively clear and warm water to this area. Third, the\nridge's position on the continental shelf places it within the thermocline\nwhich provides nutrients to the reef during upwelling (Halley and others,\n2003).\n\nThis report presents the still photographs acquired during the April 2003\ncruise aboard the Florida Institute of Oceanography's research vessel\nSuncoaster. These data are just one part of a multi-year study which includes\nthe acquisition of sidescan-sonar imagery, high-resolution bathymetry,\nhigh-resolution seismic-reflection profiles, bottom video imagery, and bottom\nsamples.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]\n",
