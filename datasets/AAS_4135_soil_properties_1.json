    "description": "Soil cores were collected from numerous locations across the Macquarie Island Isthmus to test the residual toxicity of petroleum hydrocarbons in sub-Antarctic soils.. Replicate samples were collected from each location and a single sample was collected from 50cm depth below the surface. Soil samples were collected in plastic sample jars.\n\nColumn labels\nSample - Unique numerical sample identifier\nLocation - Location identifier code\nEasting - easting (m)\nNorthing - northing (m)\nDepth - Depth of collection (cm) below surface\n% Organic - Organic matter determined by loss on ignition at 550 degrees centigrade\n% 2mm - Proportion of sample by mass with particle size greater than 2mm determined by dry sieving\n% 63 um - Proportion of sample by mass with particle size greater than 63 micron,  less than 2mm determined by dry sieving\n% less than 63 um - Proportion of sample by mass with particle size less than 63 micron determined by dry sieving\n% Water - Proportion of water in field collected sample, determined by loss of mass after drying at 80deg C until constant weight\nCond uS/cm - Electrical conductivity of soil determined using field conductivity probe after addition of milli-Q water and shaking for 2 h\npH - pH of soil determined using field pH probe after addition of milli-Q water and shaking for 2 h",
