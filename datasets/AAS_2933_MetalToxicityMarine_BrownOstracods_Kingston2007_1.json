    "description": "Metadata record for data from AAS (ASAC) Project 2933.\n\nWhile it is generally thought that Antarctic organisms are highly sensitive to pollution, there is little data to support or disprove this. Such data is essential if realistic environmental guidelines, which take into account unique physical, biological and chemical characteristics of the Antarctic environment, are to be developed. Factors that modify bioavailability, and the effects of common contaminants on a range of Antarctic organisms from micro-algae to macro-invertebrates will be examined. Risk assessment techniques developed will provide the scientific basis for prioritising contaminated site remediation activities in marine environments, and will contribute to the development of guidelines specific to Antarctica.\n\nBrown Ostracod toxicity tests, Kingston 2007\n\nTest animals were collected from near shore environments at Casey Station, East Antarctica during Dec 2006 - Jan 2007, and transported to culturing facilities at the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania, where tests were conducted during 2007. The test animals were exposed to metals in non-renewable static tests in vials containing 50 mL of the test solution at ambient Antarctic coastal salinity of 34 ppt. Tests were held in temperature controlled cabinets (incubators) at a temperature of 0, 2 or 4 degrees C (+/- approximately 1 degrees C). Ten test animals were introduced into each of 3 to 5 replicate vials per treatment at test commencement, and were exposed for 10 weeks during which periodic observations were made. Test solutions were renewed in weekly water changes.\n\nPeriodic observations (time since start of test) are given in hr (hours), d (days) or w (weeks). At each observation time, test animals were scored in one of the Endpoint categories described on each worksheet. \n\nEach worksheet provides data for a particular test taxa (Brown Ostracods - taxonomy to be verified) for a given test number (T01, T02, T03, T04, T05,) and a given metal contaminant (copper, zinc, cadmium and lead).\n\nTest information is provided in the first 14 rows of each worksheet, e.g. Site of collection, Test start date, Endpoint categories etc. \n\nASU = artificial settlement units (plastic scourers used by Sarah Richards, which had been deployed in Newcomb Bay in approximately the year 2000).\n\nConcentration micro grams per litre are nominal concentrations. Measured concentrations are provided in the file: \nBrown Ostracod_chemistry.xls, as described below. \n\nTest temperature was 0 degrees C unless otherwise stated. Unit for all temperature data are degrees C. \n\nSee the readme file in the download for more information.",
