    "description": "The Edition2 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 5 (FM5) on the Suomi NPP spacecraft (CER_BDS_NPP-FM5_Edition2) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data. Each Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for a CERES scanner instrument mounted on a spacecraft. The BDS includes samples of normal and short Earth scan elevation profiles in fixed and rotating azimuth modes (including space, internal calibration, and solar calibration views). The BDS contains Level-0 raw (unconverted) science and instrument data and the geolocated converted science and instrument data. The BDS contains additional data not found in the Level-0 input file, including converted satellite position and velocity data, celestial data converted digital status data, and parameters used in the radiance count conversion equations. CERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions follow the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite on November 18, 2017.",
