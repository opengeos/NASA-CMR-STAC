    "description": "Oceanographic measurements were conducted in the Southern Ocean Indian sector during the southern summer of 2004/2005 on Aurora Australis voyage au0403, V3 2004/2005. Data were collected during a complete occupation of CLIVAR meridional section I9S; and then along a transect up the northeastern flank of the Kerguelen Plateau, south across the Princess Elizabeth Trough and onward to the Antarctic continental shelf. A total of 115 CTD vertical profile stations were taken, most to within 30 m of the bottom. Over 2450 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, CFCs, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, oxygen-18, methane, selenium and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Full depth current profiles were collected by a lowered acoustic Doppler profiler (LADCP) attached to the rosette package, while near surface current data were collected by a ship mounted ADCP. An array of 8 current meter and thermosalinograph moorings, deployed 2 years earlier on cruise au0304, were recovered from the vicinity of the Kerguelen Plateau.\n\nShip's underway data (including bathymetry, met. sensors and sea surface parameters) are included in the cruise data set; an offset correction was applied to the underway sea surface salinity and temperature data, derived from comparison with near surface CTD data.\n\nA summary of all data and important data quality information is presented in the data report. LADCP data are not included in this data set.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2312 and 2572.",
