    "description": "FLASH_TISA_Terra-NOAA20_Version4B is the Fast Longwave And SHortwave Fluxes (FLASHFlux) Daily Gridded Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) and Surfaces/Clouds Version 4B data product. This product contains low latency (< 7 days from observations) combined Terra and NOAA-20 FLASHFlux Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) globally gridded TOA and parameterized surface radiative fluxes for applied science uses. Data collection for this product is in progress.\r\n\r\nFLASHFlux data are a product line of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) project designed to process and release TOA and surface radiative fluxes for applied sciences and education uses. The FLASHFlux data product is a rapid-release product based on the algorithms developed for and data collected by the CERES project. CERES is currently producing world-class climate data products derived from measurements taken aboard NASA's Terra, Aqua, and NOAA-20 spacecraft. While of exceptional fidelity, these data products require considerable processing time to assure quality, verify accuracy, and assess precision. The result is that CERES data are typically released up to six months after acquiring the initial measurements. Such delays are of little consequence for climate studies, especially considering the improved quality of the released data products. Thus, FLASHFlux products are not intended to achieve climate quality. FLASHFlux data products were envisioned as a resource whereby CERES data could be provided to the community within a few days of the initial measurements, with some calibration accuracy requirements relaxed to gain speed. \r\n\r\nThe SSF TOA/Surface Fluxes and Clouds product contains one hour of instantaneous FLASHFlux data for a single CERES scanner instrument. The SSF combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from a higher-resolution imager, such as Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites and meteorological and ozone information from The Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) GEOS-5 FP-IT Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS-5 ADAS). NOAA-20 SSF combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with GEOS-5 ADAS. Scene identification and cloud properties are defined at the higher image resolution, and these data are averaged over the larger CERES footprint. For each CERES footprint, the SSF contains Top-of-Atmosphere fluxes in SW, LW, and NET, surface fluxes using the Langley parameterized shortwave and longwave algorithms, and cloud information. CERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES mission is a follow-up to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. CERES instrument Flight Model 5 (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite and the CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board NOAA's next generation of polar-orbiting satellites on November 18, 2017.",
