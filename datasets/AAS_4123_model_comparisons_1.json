    "description": "Although the floating sea ice surrounding the Antarctic damps ocean waves, they may still be detected hundreds of kilometres from the ice edge. Over this distance the waves leave an imprint of broken ice, which is susceptible to winds, currents, and lateral melting. The important omission of wave-ice interactions in ice/ocean models is now being addressed, which has prompted campaigns for experimental data. These exciting developments must be matched by innovative modelling techniques to create a true representation of the phenomenon that will enhance forecasting capabilities.\n\nThis metadata record details laboratory wave basin experiments that were conducted to determine:\n\n(i) the wave induced motion of an isolated wooden floe;\n(ii) the proportion of wave energy transmitted by an array of 40 floes; and\n(iii) the proportion of wave energy transmitted by an array of 80 floes.\n\nMonochromatic incident waves were used, with different wave periods and wave amplitudes.\n\nThe dataset provides:\n\n(i) response amplitude operators for the rigid-body motions of the isolated floe; and\n(ii) transmission coefficients for the multiple-floe arrays,\n\nextracted from raw experimental data using spectral methods.\n\nThe dataset also contains codes required to produce theoretical predictions for comparison with the experimental data. The models are based on linear potential flow theory.\n\nThese data models were developed to be applicable to Southern Ocean conditions.",
