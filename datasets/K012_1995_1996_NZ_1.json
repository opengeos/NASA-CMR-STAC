    "description": "The notothenioid fish were found to have adapted to the low light conditions of under fast ice and during the Antarctic winter with well developed mechanosensory lateral line system that allows them to feed in low light. During larval development, the same fish are dependent on vision to find food. This led to the hypothesis that a common life history strategy in Antarctic fish will switch from visual to non-visual feeding during development, called the ontogenetic shift hypothesis. A complete development series of Pleurogramma antarcticum was obtained and extensive anatomical studies of the development of the eyes and lateral line system and sensory regions of the brain were studied to test the ontogenetic shift hypothesis.",
