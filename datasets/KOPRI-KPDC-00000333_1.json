    "description": "To investigate the controls that affect inorganic carbon in the water column of the Southern Ocean, hydrographic survey using R/V Polarstern was carried out from November 26, 2009 to January 20, 2010. At 28 stations, 325 samples for total alkalinity were collected from Niskin bottle to 500 ml boro-silicate glass bottles on board. In addition to these investigation, to understand the distribution of the various component of carbonic system, underway observation of CO2 parameters was carried out along the cruise track from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Wellington, New Zealand. 576 samples were taken from the water inlet that was about 7m below the surface for the IBRV Araon.\nAccurate measurement concerning spatio-temporal variability in CO2 in the water column is highly important to understanding of global carbon cycle and reliable prediction for the future atmospheric concentration of CO2. From flux study perspective of CO2, the Amundsen Sea of the Southern Ocean has known as sink for atmospheric CO2 owing to high biological production. But there wasn't enough data, and sea ice have an ambiguous role of air-sea CO2 exchange so that further research must be conducted.",
