    "description": "Data Acquisition:\n\nSampling was performed on seawater collected from CTDs and minicosm experiments. Sampling involved the collection of 250 mL of seawater from each Niskin bottle and minicosm sampled. 100 mL of this was fixed with 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). A second 100 mL sample was filtered through a 0.45 micron filter and then fixed with HCl. The remaining water was filtered and purged, with the volatile gases eluted being trapped on gold wool enclosed in glass tubes.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nAnalysis of the gold wool tubes involved heating the tubes to separate the dimethylsulphide (DMS) and then purge and trap followed by gas chromatography (GC) to give the DMS concentration of the seawater sample. The fixed water samples and filtered fixed water samples were basified and then the DMS formed during this process was purged, trapped and analysed by GC to determine the dissolved and particulate dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) concentrations. Analysis is expected to take approximately one year to complete.\n\nDataset Format: The data for the CTD sampling is in the following format - CTD Number; Niskin Bottle; DMS Concentration (nM); DMSP particulate concentration (nM); DMSP dissolved concentration (nM)\n\nThe data for the minicosm sampling is in the following format: Minicosm Number; Minicosm Day; Hour; Tank Number; DMS Concentration (nM); DMSP particulate concentration (nM); DMSP dissolved concentration (nM)\n\nAcronyms Used:\nCTD -   conductivity, temperature, pressure\nDMS -   dimethylsulphide \nDMSP -  dimethylsulphoniopropionate\nDMSO -  dimethylsulphoxide\nGC -    gas chromatography\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2655 and 2679 (ASAC_2655, ASAC_2679).",
