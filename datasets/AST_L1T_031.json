    "description": "The Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Level 1 Precision Terrain Corrected Registered At-Sensor Radiance (AST_L1T) Version 3.1 data contains calibrated at-sensor radiance, which corresponds with the ASTER Level 1B AST_L1B  (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1B.003), that has been geometrically corrected and rotated to a north-up UTM projection. The AST_L1T V3.1 is created from a single resampling of the corresponding ASTER L1A AST_L1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) product. Radiometric calibration coefficients Version 5 (RCC V5) are applied to this product to improve the degradation curve derived from vicarious and lunar calibrations. The bands available in the AST_L1T V3.1 depend on the bands in the AST_L1A and can include up to three Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) bands, six Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands, and five Thermal Infrared (TIR) bands. The AST_L1T V3.1 dataset does not include the aft-looking VNIR band 3.\r\n\r\nThe 3.1 version uses a precision terrain correction process that incorporates GLS2000 digital elevation data with derived ground control points (GCPs) to achieve topographic accuracy for all daytime scenes where correlation statistics reach a minimum threshold. Alternate levels of correction are possible (systematic terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that otherwise represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g., cloud cover).\r\n\r\nFor daytime images, if the VNIR or SWIR telescope collected data and precision correction was attempted, each precision terrain corrected image will have an accompanying independent quality assessment. It will include the geometric correction available for distribution in both a text file and a single band browse image with the valid GCPs overlaid.\r\n\r\nThis multi-file product also includes georeferenced full resolution browse images. The number of browse images and the band combinations of the images depend on the bands available in the corresponding AST_L1A dataset.\r\n\r\nThe AST_L1T V3.1 data product is only available through NASA\u2019s Earthdata Search. The ASTER L1T V3.1 Order Instructions provide step-by-step directions for ordering this product.\r\n",
