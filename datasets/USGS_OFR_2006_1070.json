    "description": "The Kuskokwim mineral belt of Bundtzen and Miller (1997) forms an important\nmetallogenic region in southwestern Alaska that has yielded more than 3.22\nmillion ounces of gold and 400,000 ounces of silver. Precious-metal and related\ndeposits in this region associated with Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary\nigneous complexes extend into the Taylor Mountains 1:250,000-scale quadrangle.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey is conducting geologic mapping and a mineral\nresource assessment of this area that will provide a better understanding of\nthe geologic framework, regional geochemistry, and may provide targets for\nmineral exploration and development. During the 2004 field season 137 rock\nsamples were collected for a variety of purposes.\n\nAll samples were analyzed for a suite of 42 trace-elements to provide data for\nuse in geochemical exploration as well as some baseline data. Selected samples\nwere analyzed by additional methods; 104 targeted geochemical exploration\nsamples were analyzed for gold, arsenic, and mercury; 21 of these samples were\nalso analyzed to obtain concentrations of 10 loosely bound metals; 33 rock\nsamples were analyzed for major element oxides to support the regional mapping\nprogram, of which 28 sedimentary rock samples were also analyzed for total\ncarbon, and carbonate carbon.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
