    "description": "This dataset contains a three-dimensional (3-D), coupled ice-ocean Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) hydrodynamic simulations of circulation, temperature, and water surface elevation of Lake Superior for the years 2010-2012.  The model was validated with temperature observations at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoys and mooring data from 2010. The upwelling event observed in satellite imagery and at a mooring station was reproduced by the model, in August 2010 along the northwestern coast. FVCOM version 3.1.6 was used for these simulations including custom modifications for wind-wave mixing (Hu and Wang, 2010) and centered-difference time integration. Ice simulations used the unstructured-grid, community ice code (UG-CICE) that was included with FVCOM version 3.1.6 (Chen et al. 2011; Gao et al. 2011).  North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) 32 km data (Mesinger et al. 2006) was used as atmospheric boundary conditions which included heat flux components (i.e., \"heating_on=T\" in the namelist).  To convert the NARR forcings to the FVCOM unstructured grid, the interpolation scheme built in to FVCOM (WRF2FVCOM) was used.  Details for these simulations can be found in the namelist file \"narr_0913_run.nml\" included in this data archive.",
