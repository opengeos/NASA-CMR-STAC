    "description": "The QuickBird Panchromatic Imagery collection contains satellite imagery acquired from Maxar Technologies by the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program. Imagery was collected by the DigitalGlobe QuickBird-2 satellite using the Ball High Resolution Camera 60 across the global land surface from October 2001 to January 2015. This data product includes panchromatic imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.55m at nadir and a temporal resolution of 2.5 to 5.6 days. The data are provided in National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) and GeoTIFF formats. This level 1B data is sensor corrected and is an un-projected (raw) product. The data potentially serve a wide variety of applications that require high resolution imagery. Data access is restricted based on a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) license, and investigators must be approved by the CSDA Program.",
