    "description": "INDICATOR DEFINITION\nThe quantity of fuel used by generator sets and boilers at Casey, Davis, Mawson and Macquarie Island stations as measured on a monthly basis and reported in the monthly reports from the Station Plant Inspectors to the Kingston (Head Office) Mechanical Supervisor.\n\nTYPE OF INDICATOR\nThere are three types of indicators used in this report:\n1.Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system;\n2.Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system;\n3.Determine RESPONSES to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.\n\nThis indicator is one of: PRESSURE\n\nRATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION\nThe amount of fuel used in Antarctica for power generation and heating is proportional to environmental impact due to the emissions released.\n\nSpecial Antarctic Blend (SAB), a light diesel like fuel, is used at the stations to power the station generator sets, to provide heat through boilers, and to run plant and equipment including the station incinerator and vehicles.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial scale: Australian Antarctic stations: Casey (lat 66 deg 16' 54.5& S, long 110 deg 31' 39.4& E), Davis (lat 68 deg 34' 35.8& S, long 77 deg 58' 02.6& E), Mawson (lat 67 deg 36' 09.7& S, long 62 deg 52' 25.7& E) and Macquarie Island (lat 54 deg 37' 59.9& S, long 158 deg 52' 59.9& E).\n\nFrequency: Monthly reports\n\nMeasurement technique: The figures are obtained by direct reading of gauges on the stations on a regular basis.  The data are recorded in the Plant Inspectors monthly reports.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nIn the future, it is planned to automate the collection of most of this data.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nSOE Indicator 1 - Monthly mean air temperatures at Australian Antarctic stations.\nSOE Indicator 2 - Highest monthly air temperatures at Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 3 - Lowest monthly air temperatures at Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 4 - Monthly mean lower stratospheric temperatures above Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 7 - Monthly mean of three-hourly wind speeds (m/s)\nSOE Indicator 48 - Station and ship person days\nSOE Indicator 57 - Monthly total of fuel used by station incinerators\nSOE Indicator 58 - Monthly total of fuel used by station vehicles\nSOE Indicator 59 - Monthly electricity usage\nSOE Indicator 60 - Total helicopter hours\nSOE Indicator 61 - Total potable water consumption\nSOE Indicator 65 - Station footprint for Australian Antarctic stations",
