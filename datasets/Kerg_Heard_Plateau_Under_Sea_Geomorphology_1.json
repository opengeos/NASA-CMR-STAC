    "description": "The geomorphology was digitised using contours derived from the DEM created by Dr. R. Beaman from James Cook University for Geoscience Australia.\n\nThe data, the metadata record and the report related to the creation of that DEM  are available on the Geoscience Australia  website:\nName of data set: Kerguelen Plateau Bathymetric Grid 2010\nCatalogue number: 71552\nhttps://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search?node=srv#/metadata/a05f7893-007f-7506-e044-00144fdd4fa6\n\nDigitising:\nIt must be stressed that neither  seismic data, sea floor sediments, nor sea floor biota were used to determine the sea floor geomorphology.  The description on how the geomorphology was derived is described in the attached report.\n\nThe features described as slopes from the 900m to 1300m isobaths and from the 1300m to 2500m isobaths were identified for fisheries purposes and not geomorphology purposes. A geomorphologist may combine these slopes into a single feature.\n\nSome of the larger shallow features identified as banks may more properly be identified as plateaus. It would require a more in depth analysis of the DEM, slopes and sediments to accurately identify the feature as a bank or plateau.",
