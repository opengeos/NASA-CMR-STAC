    "description": "Acoustic Doppler current profiler data were collected using a RD Instruments, 300 kHz ADCP that was mounted on an acoustic sled and towed alongside the R/V Annika Marie.  Deployment was somewhat limited by weather, with higher sea states precluding use of the instrument.  Data were processed by Frank Bahr at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.    Two files are included:  A matlab file and a .zip file containing ascii files for each deployement.    2.)   ascii format. The .mat file sos2010_dt.mat contains all deployments in the structure vm_data.&#8232;The format is described in a text variable \"readme\" contained in sos2010_dt.mat  2.)   ascii format.   &#8232;The data are also presented in ascii, with one data file per deployment, with files zipped together in to sos2010dt_ascii.zip. &#8232;The first line of each file gives the center depth of the ADCP bins in meters. &#8232;Note that both the bin depths as well as the number of bins may change&#8232;between deployments.&#8232;&#8232;It is followed by one line per ADCP profile, listing&#8232;- profile time as year/month/day hour:min:sec, &#8232;- profile time in 2010 decimal days (noon on Jan 1 equals decimal day 0.5) &#8232;- longitude, latitude in decimal degrees&#8232;- N values of zonal velocity, positive eastward, where N is the number of bins &#8232;- N values of meridional velocity, positive northward&#8232;&#8232;\"Bad\" data are marked with the flag value 999.99.",
