    "description": "Surface- and ground-water quality data were collected in the\nApalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River basin from August 1992 to\nSeptember 1995 as part of the USGS National Water Quality Assessment\n(NAWQA) program described below. The ACF River basin drains about\n19,800 square miles in western Georgia, eastern Alabama, and the\nFlorida panhandle into the Apalachicola Bay, which discharges into the\nGulf of Mexico. Data collected as part of this study focused on five\nmajor land uses: poultry production in the headwaters of the\nChattahoochee River, urban and suburban areas of Metropolitan Atlanta\nand Columbus, silviculture in the piedmont and fall line hills, and\nrow crop agriculture in the upper coastal plain (clastic hydrogeologic\nsetting) and the lower coastal plain (karst hydrogeologic setting).\n\nThis description is for the surface-water sites which are grouped\nbased on six landuse classifications: poultry, suburban, urban,\nsilviculture, agriculture (clastic geology) and agriculure (karst\ngeology), and by site type: main stem and tributary. The data are\ngrouped into three catogories including water column, bed sediment and\ntissue, and Biological. The data are further subdivided into sets of\nrelated constituents.  A complete list of constituent names and MRL's\nis available.\n\nThe user can view and retrieve these surface-water data sets:\n\nWater Column: Field Measurements, Nutrients, Major Ions, Suspended\nSediment, Organic Carbon, Turbidity, Pesticides .\n\nBed-Sediment and Tissue: Semivolitile Organic Compounds in Sediment,\nOrganochlorine Compounds in Sediment, Major and Trace Elements in\nSediment, Organochlorine Compounds in Tissue, Trace Elements in Tissue.\n\nBiological: Algae, Fish, Invertebrates.\n\nPhysical, chemical, and biological data were collected at 132 stream\nsites and at 15 locations within 6 reservoirs. The monitoring network\nis a nested design with a core of fixed monitoring sites (integrator\nand indicator sites), a group of land-use comparison sites, and a\ngroup of mixed land use sites including large tributaries and main\nstem rivers that provide spatial distribution. Water samples were\ncollected at frequencies varying from hourly to annually, depending on\nthe intended purpose, and were analyzed for nutrients, carbon,\npesticides, major ions, and field parameters.\n\nThese data and associated locator maps are accessible on the World\nWide Web at the ACF NAWQA home page. Data are presented in manageable\ntables that are grouped based on land use, site type, and project\ncomponent. The user can view maps and data tables on the computer\nscreen, or downloaded data tables as tab delimited (RDB) files.\n\nData collected as part of the ACF River basin study are presented by\nproject component: surface-water, ground-water, special studies,\nstreamflow, ancillary, and quality assurance data. The water-quality\ndata are presented by major headings, including water-column,\nbed-sediment and tissue, and biological. The data are further\nsubdivided into data sets consisting of related constituents. Data\ntables can be viewed on the users computer screen or retrieved to a\nusers computer as a tab delimited Relational Data Base (RDB) file. To\nreduce the size of the pesticide, volatile organic compound, bed\nsediment and tissue, and trace element tables, only those compounds\nfound equal to, or above the minimum reporting limit (MRL) for one or\nmore sites within a group, are shown. The remaining compounds were not\ndetected. A complete list of constituent names and MRL's are\navailable.\n\nThe National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program of the\nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is designed to describe the status and\ntrends in the quality of the Nation's ground- and surface-water\nresources and to provide a sound understanding of the natural and\nhuman factors that affect the quality of these resources (Leahy and\nothers, 1990).  Because much of the public concern over water quality\nstems from a desire to protect both human health and aquatic life, the\nNAWQA Program will, in addition to measuring physical and chemical\nindicators of water-quality, assess the status of aquatic life through\nsurveys of fish, invertebrates, and benthic algae, and habitat\nconditions (National Research Council, 1990).  As an integrated\nassessment of water quality incorporating physical, chemical, and\nbiological components, the NAWQA Program is ecological in approach.",
