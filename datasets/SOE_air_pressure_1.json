    "description": "INDICATOR DEFINITION\nMonthly means of three-hourly pressures, reduced to mean sea level, for Australian Antarctic stations Casey, Davis, Mawson,  Macquarie Island and Heard Island.\n\nTYPE OF INDICATOR\nThere are three types of indicators used in this report:\n1.Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system;\n2.Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system;\n3.Determine RESPONSES to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.\n\nThis indicator is one of: CONDITION\n\nRATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION\nMeasurement of the pressure over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is considered important for monitoring behaviour of pressure systems on a local and global scale, which will help to interpret global climate change.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial Scale: Australian Antarctic stations: Casey (lat 66 degrees 16' 54.5\" S, long 110 degrees 31' 39.4\" E), Davis (lat 68 degrees 34' 35.8\" S, long 77 degrees 58' 02.6\" E), Mawson (lat 67 degrees 36' 09.7\" S, long 62 degrees 52' 25.7\" E), Macquarie Island (lat 54 degrees 37' 59.9\" S, long 158 degrees 52' 59.9\" E), Atlas Cove, Heard Island (lat 53 degrees 1' 8\" S, long 73 \ndegrees 23' 30\" E) and Spit Bay, Heard Island (lat 53 degrees 6' 30\" S, 73 degrees 43' 21\" E).\n\nFrequency: Monthly.\n\nMeasurement technique: Barometry.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nThere is need to develop a high-quality data set from the available data, correcting erroneous data and estimating missing data. Adjustment may be necessary for changes in site location or exposure, and for changes in instrumentation or observing practices.\n\nSome of these changes are documented in the station history files held by the Regional Observations Section. These history files are currently held as paper records, although more recent information is held electronically and there is an effort to digitise the older records.\n\nBefore the data can be used for the detection of change, a concerted effort will need to be made to identify deficiencies in the data, and then make compensations where possible. This is made more difficult by the lack of suitable comparison sites.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nSOE Indicators 1 - Monthly mean air temperatures for Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicators 2 - Monthly highest temperatures for Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicators 3 - Monthly lowest temperatures for Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicators 4 - Monthly mean lower-stratospheric temperature above Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicators 5 - Monthly mean mid-tropospheric temperature above Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicators 38 - Mean sea level\nSOE Indicators 62 - Water levels of Deep Lake, Vestfold Hills\n\nNote - Station codes in the data are as follows:\n300000 - Davis\n300001 - Mawson\n300004 - Macquarie Island\n300005 - Atlas Cove, Heard Island\n300017 - Casey\n300028 - Spit Bay, Heard Island\n\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nMean MSL Pressure\nYear\nMonth\nStation\nStation Code\nField\nValue\nEnough Observations\nNumber Observations",
