    "description": "Azorella macquariensis leaf traits were assessed across Macquarie Island (lat, longs: N - 54.50534, S: -54.76911, E: 158.9263, W, 158.8009). Leaves were collected between 2 January 2017 to 28 February 2017 and fixed in 70% ethanol on site.  Leaves were measured at Monash University 1 June 2018 to 29 June 2018.\n\nThe endemic, keystone species Azorella macquariensis (Macquarie cushion) has undergone rapid widespread decline across Macquarie Island in 2008/2009, resulting in its listing as critically endangered in 2010.  Initial research suggests that Azorella dieback is likely driven by a decadal reduction in plant available water, as a result of a significantly changed regional climate, which may have facilitated a secondary putative pathogenic infection of weakened plants (Bergstrom et al. 2015, Whinam et al. 2014). \n\nAzorella macquariensis Orchard (Apiaceae, Macquarie cushion) leaf samples were taken from 62 sites across Macquarie Island between January and March 2017.  Sites (706.86m2, i.e. 15m radius) were randomly stratified using a terrain class model (TCM) to ensure that all potential microclimates that A. macquariensis might be exposed to were surveyed. Methods for the TCM are described in Dickson et al. in prep. Six samples were taken at each site, one from within each of the six 2mx2m plots, which were located on Azorella with representative condition (dieback) variation. Samples (3-5 5cm rosette lengths) were taken from the healthiest cushion in the plot and fixed immediately in 70% ethanol. Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment permit number TFL1676. Samples were returned to Monash University and stored at room temperature.\n\nLeaf samples were measured at Monash University in June 2018. One rosette branchlete was used from each sample (barcode) and the new (green) growth of the 2016/2017 season measured, indicated by the colour variation on the sample. For each sample (representing one individual, six per site) the following was measured, new stem growth (green), number of new leaves (green). Four leaves were measured per sample, some only had 3 new leaves, so only 3 would be measured. L1 was closest at the growing tip and L4 furthest from the tip. L1:L4 were flattened between slides and scanned (tif files), for measurements and then the number of spines per leaf were counted under a dissecting microcscope. Green leaf area (mm2), maximum green leaf width (mm), green leaf length (mm) and sheath width (mm) were measured using standard methods in FIJI (Image J 1.52f) from the scanned images.\n\nData available:\nExcel files containing the location and barcode of samples (372) and individual leaf measurements (1488) for each A. macquariensis sample.
