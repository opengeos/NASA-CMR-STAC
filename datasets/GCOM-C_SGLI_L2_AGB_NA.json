    "description": "GCOM-C/SGLI L2 Above Ground Biomass and Vegetation Roughness Index dataset is obtained from the SGLI sensor onboard GCOM-C and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GCOM-C is Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent Orbit satellite launched on December 23, 2017, which mounts SGLI and conducts long-term global observations of geophysical variables related to the global climate system across 28 items including aerosol and vegetation over 4 areas of atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere. The data will be used to contribute to higher accuracy of global warming prediction. The SGLI has swath of 1150 km in the visible band and 1400 km in the infrared band. Level 2 products are defined to be products composed of physical quantity data that is calculated based on Level 1B products and meteorological data, as well as various additional data related to the physical quantity data. This dataset includes Above Ground Biomass (AGB), Vegetation Roughness Index (VRI) and quality flag (QA_Flag). AGB is the volume of aboveground biomass shown in dry weight and estimated using two sets of the red and near-infrared channel data observed from nadir and slant viewing direction by SGLI sensor. The physical quantity unit is t/ha. VRI is the index expressing 3D structural information of vegetation (the unevenness changes in spatial distribution of canopy density). It is related to both the area ratio of shadows produced by the vegetation canopy in the sensor's field of view and the vegetation coverage. It is a parameter for calculating AGB. The physical quantity unit is dimensionless. The QA_flag shows flag of quality and observation condition. The provided format is HDF5. The spatial resolution is 250 m. The projection method is EQA. The generation unit is Tile. The current version of the product is Version 3. The Version 2 is also available, but please note that the QA_Flag data has been changed.",
