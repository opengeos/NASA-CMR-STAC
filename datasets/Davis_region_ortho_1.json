    "description": "The extent of the Davis region orthophoto is from Powell Point in the north to Ellis Narrows in the south and from Plough Island in the west and to the eastern end of Lake Stinear in the east. The orthophoto was compiled from aerial photography flown on 11 February 1997 at 1500 metres with a Zeiss UMK1318 terrestrial camera (nominal focal length of 100 mm), adapted to aerial photography. \n\nThe survey control is given in a spreadsheet, included with the file available for download from the provided URL.\n\nThe ground control in the southern part of the orthophoto are surveyed natural features, in the Davis station area they are man made features such as buildings and in the northern half of the orthophoto they are the locations of natural features, such as dykes that were mapped in the original 1:25,000 mapping of the Vestfold Hills (metadata record - vest_hills_gis) and then identified in the 1500m aerial photography.",
