    "description": "This set of interactive graphics was produced in preparation for the\nseventh Conference of the Parties (COP-7) to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in The\nNetherlands in October-November 2001. They are based on several UNFCCC\nSecretariat documents compiling data from submissions by Annex I\ncountries; these include First and Second National Communications, as\nwell as annual national inventory data. Additional sources include\nupdated reports from individual countries; exceptions are noted on the\ngraphs.\n\nThe graphs feature actual (1990-2000) and projected (2005, 2010)\nemissions of the six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane\n(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),\nperfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The emissions\nare aggregated and represented as CO2 equivalents in million tonnes\n(1012); please note that in UNFCCC documents, emissions are measured\nin gigagrams (10**9).\n\nFor more information on the derivation of GHG emissions statistics,\nsee:\n\"http://www.grida.no/db/maps/collection/climate6/about.htm\"",
