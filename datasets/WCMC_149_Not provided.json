    "description": "This sourcebook of biodiversity data was released in part as a\n                  contribution to the First Conference of the Parties to the\n                  Convention on Biological Diversity (Bahamas, 28 November - 9\n                  December) in anticipation that it will provide information of\n                  interest and relevance.\n                  \n                  An extended introduction to many theoretical and applied aspects\n                  of biological diversity was provided in Global Biodiversity:\n                  status of the Earth's living resources (WCMC, 1992; funded\n                  largely by the UK Overseas Development Administration). That\n                  document, which benefitted from collaboration with many\n                  organisations and individual scientists, was produced at the time\n                  of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development\n                  held in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. The purpose of the book was to\n                  provide conceptual background and baseline data both to\n                  practitioners in the biodiversity field, and to all concerned\n                  persons who needed a guide into that complex and highly topical\n                  area.\n                  \n                  Given the grounding previously provided in Global Biodiversity,\n                  the present volume concentrates on data rather than text and\n                  provides an illustrative set of data tables, in part revised and\n                  expanded from the earlier volume. The choice of data to be\n                  included and the manner of presentation have been determined with\n                  the likely end-users borne strongly in mind.  With this aim, most\n                  data are presented in standardised tables by country, so that\n                  they are immediately available to users working at a national\n                  level but can also be placed easily in regional and global\n                  contexts. Overall, they give a good indication of the global\n                  availability of information on many aspects of biodiversity,\n                  drawing attention to some of the gaps that exist and to the\n                  regional imbalances in the distribution of biodiversity and the\n                  resources that have been devoted to its assessment and study.",
