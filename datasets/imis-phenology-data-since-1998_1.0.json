    "description": "Long-term phenological data in alpine regions are often limited to a few locations and thus, little is known about climate-change induced plant phenological shifts above the treeline. Because plant growth initiation in seasonally snow-covered regions is largely driven by snowmelt timing and local temperature, it is essential to simultaneously track phenological shifts, snowmelt, and near-ground temperatures. In this study, we make use of ultrasonic snow height sensors installed at climate stations in the Swiss Alps to reveal phenological advance of grassland ecosystems and relate them to climatic changes over 25 years (1998 \u2013 2023). When snow is absent, these snow height sensors additionally provide information on plant growth at a uniquely fine temporal scale. Daily temperatures and snow- / plant height values, annual phenological- and melt-out dates were derived from IMIS climate station data (doi.org/10.16904/envidat.406). We observed an advance of green-up by -2.4 days/decade coinciding with strong warming of up to +0.8\u00b0C/decade. Although the timing of melt-out has not changed significantly over the study period in this focal region, phenological responses to early melt-out years varied due to differing influences of photoperiodic and thermal constraints, which were not equally important across elevations and communities. Phenological shifts of alpine grasslands are thus likely to become even more pronounced if melt-out timing advances in the future as predicted.   This repository relates to the publication Zehnder et al. (2025). Snow height sensors reveal phenological advance in alpine grasslands. Global Change Biology. accepted. The model data and code that support our findings are deposited in this repository.",
