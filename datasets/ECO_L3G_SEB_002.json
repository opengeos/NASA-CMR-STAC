    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52\u00b0 N and 52\u00b0 S latitudes. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found in Figure 2 on the [ECOSTRESS website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\n\nThe ECOSTRESS Gridded Surface Energy Balance Instantaneous L3 Global 70 m (ECO_L3G_SEB) Version 2 data product provides estimated incoming surface radiation (Rg) and net radiation (Rn) aligned with each daytime ECOSTRESS overpass. The Rg was generated using the Forest Light Environmental Simulator (FLiES) radiative transfer model implemented in an artificial neural network using Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) from Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) along with albedo from ECOSTRESS Tiled Ancillary NDVI and Albedo Level 2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2T_STARS) Version 2 as variables. The Rg output from the FLiES model was bias corrected to Rg from GEOS-FP. The Rn is an output from the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) algorithm. This data product is mosaicked from the L3 tiled SEB (ECO_L3T_SEB) product, projected to a globally snapped 0.0006\u00b0 grid, and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m).\n\nThe ECO_L3G_SEB Version 2 data product contains four layers distributed in an HDF5 format file including Rg, Rn, cloud mask, and water mask.\n\nKnown Issues\n* Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\n* Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\n* Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\n* Missing Cloud Layer Alert: All users of ECOSTRESS Tiled and Gridded L3 Soil Moisture and Surface Energy Balance v002 products (ECO_L3T_SM, ECO_L3G_SM, ECO_L3T_SEB and ECO_L3G_SEB) should be aware that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccloud mask\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 layer may be unavailable for a select number of granules for the year 2023. Users are encouraged to get that information from the corresponding Level 2 Standard Cloud Mask products (ECO_L2_CLOUD and ECO_L2G_CLOUD) to assess if a pixel is clear or cloudy (see section 3 of the User Guide).\n* Solar Array Obstruction: Some ECOSTRESS scenes may be affected by solar array obstructions from the International Space Station (ISS), potentially impacting data quality of obstructed pixels. The 'FieldOfViewObstruction' metadata field is included in all Version 2 products to indicate possible obstructions:\n     * Before October 24, 2024 (orbits prior to 35724): The field is present but was not populated and does not reliably identify affected scenes.\n     * On or after October 24, 2024 (starting with orbit 35724): The field is populated and generally accurate, except for late December 2024, when a temporary processing error may have caused false positives.\n     * A [list of scenes](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2249/obst_all_sort.txt) confirmed to be affected by obstructions is available and is recommended for verifying historical data (before October 24, 2024) and scenes from late December 2024.\n* The ISS native pointing information is coarse relative to ECOSTRESS pixels, so ECOSTRESS geolocation is improved through image matching with a basemap. Metadata in the L1B_GEO file shows the success of this geolocation improvement, using categorizations \"best\", \"good\", \"suspect\", and \"poor\". We recommend that users use only \"best\" and \"good\" scenes for evaluations where geolocation is important (e.g., comparison to field sites). For some scenes, this metadata is not reflected in the higher-level products (e.g., land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, etc.). While this metadata is always available in the geolocation product, to save users additional download, we have produced a [summary text file](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2253/qa_20250423-present.txt) that includes the geolocation quality flags for all scenes from launch to present. At a later date, all higher-level products will reflect the geolocation quality flag correctly (the field name is GeolocationAccuracyQA).\n*During the time period of May 15th, 2025, through July 1st, 2025, ECOSTRESS data was noisier than expected. Cycling the payload resolved the issue, but researchers should use all levels of ECOSTRESS data acquired during this time period with caution.",
