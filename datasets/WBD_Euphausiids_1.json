    "description": "This metadata record has been created to describe a commercial CD product of the Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification. This CD has in no way been produced by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), and the metadata record is only intended as a reference for AAD employees.\n\nFrom the CD booklet:\n\nEuphausiids of the World Ocean is a CD-ROM monograph on the order of Euphausiacea by Edward Brinton, Mark D. Ohman, Annie W Townsend, Margaret D. Knight and Amy L. Bridgeman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\n\nThis CD-ROM summarises information concerning Euphausiid taxonomy, morphology, biogeographic distributions, and larval development.  An illustrated multiple-entry taxonomic key and a pictorial key facilitate the identification of the 86 species covered.  Species recognition is further aided by an interactive glossary and a wealth of illustrations, photos and movies.\n\nThis taxonomic reference work concerns a completely revised monograph on the order Euphausiaceae.  Detailed information on all 86 recognised species and higher taxa is given, including full systematic descriptions, taxonomy, morphology, biogeographic distributions, references and colour photographs and drawings.  Some information on euphausiid behaviour is included, mostly in the form of short videos of swimming, bioluminescence, and schooling.\n\nThe database also holds unique information on larval development for most of the species.  An explanation of the probable evolutionary progression of euphausiid genera is given.  Two types of fully illustrated computer-assisted identification keys (a multiple-entry key expert system and a picture key) provide quick and easy access to the species information.  The distribution information is stored in an interactive geographic information system, allowing for fast geographic searches and comparisons of distribution patterns.  All text is hyperlinked; an illustrated glossary explains 104 terms and a reference database contains all principal literature references for the euphausiids.\n\nThis CD-ROM is the definitive information source on Euphausiids for marine biologists, environmentalists and students.  It should be present in any marine biology library.\n\nThe Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification (ETI) is a Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) in operational relation with UNESCO, dedicated to the production of scientific and educational computer software for the preservation of knowledge concerning the worlds plants and animals.  ETI is supported by The Netherlands Government, the University of Amsterdam, UNESCO, and other international organisations.  It cooperates with major scientific institutes around the world.",
