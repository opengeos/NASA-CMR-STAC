    "description": "This record contains a collection of maps of integrated particle density at different altitudes.  These images were produced from the gridded dataset described in the metadata record with the ID \"SIPEX_II_NAME_Gridded\".  See the provided URL.\n    \nThe UK Met Office's Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME) is used to model a wide range of atmospheric dispersion events.\n\nThese data were collected during the SIPEX II voyage of the Aurora Australis, 2012.\n    \nThe use of NAME and the NWP met data was provided by the UK Met Office for free for research purposes. The analysed wind fields used for the running of NAME are calculated using the Met Office's Unified Model (UM). These are calculated by incorporating all observational site data at six hourly intervals into a forecasting system +/- 3 hours of the observation time. This is continuously repeated to produce a 3D analysis of the state of the atmosphere defined by meteorological variables. It is these variables that are incorporated into NAME and are used to calculate wind vectors, particle position, etc. The global resolution for these fields is 25 km.\n\nModel Descriptor\nInert particles released for two hours each day between 01:00 - 03:00. The lat/lon for the ship was taken at 02:00 every day. The particles were tracked backwards in time for ten days. The NAME output grid comprised of 267 by 165 boxes of 0.5652 degrees longitude and 0.375 degrees latitude. The lat/lon minimum was 60.0,-85.0 and the max was 210,-23. The plots show the daily particle densities in g s m-3 per grid box for the whole of the back run. There are four different types of plots showing surface influence (0-100m), whole troposphere influence (0-16000m) and below the avg boundary layer (BL). The BL heights have also been plotted at the time of release for each of the backruns.",
