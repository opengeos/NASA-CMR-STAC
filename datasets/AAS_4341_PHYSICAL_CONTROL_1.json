    "description": "Data on the regrowth and emergence of Stellaria media following the application of several physical weed control methods on Macquarie Island.\n    \nThere is one spreadsheet of data on the regrowth and emergence of Stellaria media in small plots following the application of several physical weed control methods for the weed on Macquarie Island including hand weeding, trimming, and scalping as well as an undisturbed control. The experiment was undertaken at 4 sites, Bauer Bay, Brother\u2019s Point, Island Lake and Tractor Rock and included a second hand weeding for some treatments. Percentage cover of the weed and other species were recorded in each of the plots. More detailed methods are given in the file.\n\n\nIn-situ experiments involving treatments (1x1m plots) such as hand weeding, digging, cutting plants at ground level and scalping established at 6 infested sites to assess remediation effectiveness in subsequent seasons.",
