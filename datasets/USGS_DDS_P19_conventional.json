    "description": "The purpose of these files is to illustrate the geologic boundary of\nthe play as defined for the 1995 U.S. National Assessment. The play\nwas used as the fundamental assessment unit.\n\nThe fundamental geologic unit used in the 1995 National Oil and Gas\nAssessment was the play, which is defined as a set of known or\npostulated oil and or gas accumulations sharing similar geologic,\ngeographic, and temporal properties, such as source rock, migration\npathways, timing, trapping mechanism, and hydrocarbon type. The\ngeographic limit of each play was defined and mapped by the geologist\nresponsible for each province. The play boundaries were defined\ngeologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the\nplay, such as the limits of the reservoir rock, geologic structures,\nsource rock, and seal lithologies. The only exceptions to this are\nplays that border the Federal-State water boundary. In these cases,\nthe Federal-State water boundary forms part of the play boundary.  The\nplay boundaries were defined in the period 1993-1994.\n\nConventional oil and gas plays within province 19 (Eastern Great\nBasin) are listed here by play number and name:\n\n   Number  Name\n    1901   Unconformity \"A\"\n    1902   Late Paleozoic\n    1903   Early Tertiary - Late Cretaceous Sheep Pass and Equivalents\n    1905   Younger Tertiary Basins\n    1906   Late Paleozoic - Mesozoic (Central Nevada) Thrust Belt\n    1907   Sevier Frontal Zone",
