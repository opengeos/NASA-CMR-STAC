    "description": "These data were collected by 8 EM-APEX profiling floats, which are a sophisticated version of the standard Argo float. They measure temperature, salinity and pressure, as for standard Argo. They also use electromagnetic techniques to measure horizontal velocity.   The floats were deployed across the northern Kerguelen Platueau in November 2008, and drifted eastward with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as they profiled between the surface and 1600 dbar. They transmitted data through the Iridium satellite system and continued to profile eastward until their batteries failed. The range of latitudes covered is approx. 40S-50S, and longitudes 65E-90E. Although most of the data is in the longitude band 65E-78E. The temporal range of the data is Nov 2008 to approx. Sep 2009.\n \nThe file \"emapex_final.mat\" contains the quality-controlled and calibrated data from 8 EM-APEX profiling floats deployed across the northern Kerguelen Plateau during the Southern Ocean Finestructure (SOFine) experiment aboard the U.K. RRS James Cook, Cruise 29, 1st Nov-22nd Dec 2008, Cape Town to Cape Town.\n \nFunding for the EM-APEX component of the experiment was from the Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP0877098 (N. Bindoff, H. Phillips and S. Rintoul). The Australian Antarctic Division provided subantarctic clothing for Bindoff and Phillips under AAS project #3002 (H. Phillips and N. Bindoff). AAS project #3228 (N. Bindoff and H. Phillips) provided $27,000 for salary support for a research assistant to work on analysis of the data and publication of a manuscript. Significant in-kind support was provided by CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research for the EM-APEX component.\n \nDetails of the shipboard operations and deployment of the EM-APEX floats can be found in the document \"emapex_deployment_report.pdf\". The complete voyage report is available from h.e.phillips@utas.edu.au. It may be cited as\n \nNaveira Garabato, A.; Bindoff, N.; Phillips, H.; Polzin, K.; Sloyan, B.; Stevens, D. and Waterman, S.
