    "description": "The MOD11C1.004 dataset was decommissioned as of October 19, 2017. Users are encouraged to use Version 6 of MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily L3 Global 0.05Deg CMG .  \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Terra V4 LST/E L3 Global CMG (Short name: MOD11C1) products incorporate 0.05\u00ba (5600 meters at the equator) pixels, which are derived from the MOD11B1 daily global 5 km grid product, and stored in a 0.05\u00ba geographic CMG. They are produced daily using the day/night LST algorithm, which extracts average temperatures (in Kelvin) and applies them to a pair of MODIS daytime and nighttime observations. This method yields 1 K accuracy for materials with known emissivities. The six thermal band emissivities are estimated through a classification-based look-up table (LUT). Prior to reprojecting the MOD11C1, cloud-contaminated LSTs (daytime and nighttime) are removed by a double-screening method. Further details are available in Wan et al. (2002).\r\n\r\nThe V4 MOD11C1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and emissivities for bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32.\r\n\r\nThe V4 Terra/MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11C1, are validated to Stage-1 with well-defined uncertainties over a range of representative conditions. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MOD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications. Subsequent and improved versions of this product also exist.\r\n\r\nThe V4 MOD11C1 product has an acquisition range from February 24, 2000 (2000-055) until January 3, 2007 (2007-003). The V4 collection remains consistent with V41, and users may combine the two collections in a time-series analysis.\r\n\r\nWan, ZM, Zhang, YL, Zhang, QC, Li, ZL (2002).
