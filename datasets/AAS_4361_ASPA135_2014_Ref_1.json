    "description": "This record contains an orthomosaic of multispectral imagery collected by a 6 band camera (Tetracam Mini-MCA - http://www.tetracam.com/). Data was collected in February 2014 over the ASPA135 moss bed. The camera was carried aboard a small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) that flew a grid pattern over the area at 50m above ground level. \nOrthomosaic was georeferenced via ground control points placed in ASPA135 moss bed area and with their location then measured with an RTK GPS that was running corrections from a local base station. \nThe file provided in this dataset is a 6 band binary file with an associated text header file such that software, such as ENVI or ArcGIS, can easily open the file for display. Pixel values are in reflectance percentage, i.e. 0.0-1.0, all information as to the dimensions and georeferencing of the data can be found in the header file.",
