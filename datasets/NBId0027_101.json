    "description": "The UNEP/GRID Ugandan database has been developed with ARC/INFO software at GRID- Nairobi from January to July 1987.  Datasets (using the Uganda Environmental Resource Datasets) were digitized partly by the Department of Geography of the Birkbeck college in London and partly by GRID staff in Nairobi, and all analysis was supported by a team of Ugandan experts.\n\nMost of the basic datasets were digitized from the Atlas of Uganda (1964 and 1967 editions), scales 1:1.5 m, 1:3 m and 1:6 m.  More recent data for the whole country were not available ; layers such as\nLand use and Forest reserves are out of date. However, the majority of data entered can be assumed unchanged ( geology, terrain, soils...), and some of the outdated layers were compared with more recent satellite imagery in order to map temporal changes.\n\nDerived datasets have been grouped into two classes : 1st and higher order.  In 1st order derivations, only attribute information has been added or changed ( for example map of soil productivity). In higher order derivations, boundaries have been changed, and\nentirely new entities created. All datasets are in Transverse Mercator Projection with the coordinates stored in Latitude/Longitude. Each dataset is described with source, contents, keywords and a list of attributes.",
