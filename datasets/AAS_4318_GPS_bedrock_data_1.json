    "description": "Geodetic GPS data collected with antennas connected to rock outcrops as part of AAS 4318. Six new GPS sites were established (sites CAD1, CAD2, CAD3, CAD4, CAD5 and CAD6) and measurements at a previously established site (BHIL) was recommenced. The sites were deployed continuously, although measurements were intermittent based on power restrictions and hardware performance issues.\n\nApproximate site locations are given below in units of decimal degrees (WGS84) as (latitude longitude) pairs:\nCAD1 approx coordinates only - Carey Ntk - as no data yet downloaded\nCAD2 -68.566510985 86.100627506 Mt Brown, new site established under this project\nCAD3 -66.521103808 96.363667501 Gillies Island, new site established under this project\nCAD4 -67.419656438 99.143785987 Mt Strathcona, new site established under this project\nCAD5 -66.552475869 107.764024273 Snyder Rocks, new site established under this project\nCAD6 -66.789282506 120.990964280 Chick Island, new site established under this project\nBHIL -66.251024752 100.599006649 Bunger Hills site, originally established by Geoscience Australia\n\nWe also analysed the International GNSS Service data from Casey (CAS1) and Davis (DAV1). We provide time series for all sites. We provide raw carrier phase and pseudorange data in RINEX format for sites other than DAV1 and CAS1 as these data are freely available within many public archives.\n\nSite metadata for DAV1 and CAS1 is available at the International GNSS Service (igs.org) in the form of site logs. Site logs  for BHIL and CAD1-6 are provided as part of the data archive in International GNSS format. \n\nAntennas for CAD1-6 were connected to bedrock via a POLENET antenna monument drilled and epoxied into bedrock.  Existing monuments were used for BHIL, CAS1 and DAV1. Choke ring drainage holes were plugged after deployment of sites. \n\nSite changes\n============\nInstruments were deployed continuously but did not operate continuously due to solar powering of the instruments with a small battery array.\n\nThere were no hardware changes at the sites up to the time of writing (Feb 2021). The exception was a receiver swap at site CAD3 on 2019-10-18.  The metadata within the RINEX files is correct and reflects any changes.\n\nData sets:\n=========\n1. bedrock coordinate time series \n# Data are in TSVIEW format,  a simple ascii file format\n# TSVIEW is an open Matlab code for visualising and analysing GPS time series but the series can be easily read by other software\n# TSVIEW is available at http://www-gpsg.mit.edu/~tah/GGMatlab/\n# and described in Herring, T. MATLAB Tools for viewing GPS velocities and time series. GPS Solutions 7, 194\u2013199 (2003). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10291-003-0068-0\n#\n# For each site, there are three files, ones for each of North, East and Up.\n#   For example,  for site bhil\n#    mb_bhil_NEh.dat1  is for the North component\n#    mb_bhil_NEh.dat2  is for the East component\n#    mb_bhil_NEh.dat3  is for the Up component\n#\n# each file contains three header lines followed by the data with one row per epoch, such as\n#    1995.1020       0.03150        0.00400\n# with column 1 in decimal years, column 2 is the estimate (north, east or height) in metres, and column 3 is the uncertainty (1 sigma) of the measurement in metres\n\nCoordinate time series are one file per coordinate component per site.\n\nCoordinates are in IGS14 reference frame and derived using GIPSYv6.3 using JPL repro2 clocks and orbits.\n\n2. raw RINEX v2 data. RINEX format definitions are provided at https://www.igs.org/wg/rinex/\n\n# RINEX files are provided one per day per site, covering 24hr UT.",
