    "description": "Australia's Census of Antarctic Marine Life project.\n\nThis project is a part of the international \"Census of Antarctic Marine Life\" (CAML) which was conducted during the International Polar Year. It was a collaborative contribution by Australia and France to understand the biodiversity of the oceans surrounding Antarctica, with particular emphasis on the fishes of the eastern part of the Australian Antarctic Territory. The biodiversity data, when added to that obtained by all other nations participating in the CAML, serves as a robust reference for future examinations of the health of the Southern Ocean, and assists in the conservation and management of the region.\n\nField sampling for this project was undertaken in the 2007/08 season, commencing in December and finishing in February 2008.  Three ships surveyed the area with a range of traditional and modern sampling gear, including IYGPT (International Young Gadoid Pelagic Trawl (marine science equipment)) gear.",
