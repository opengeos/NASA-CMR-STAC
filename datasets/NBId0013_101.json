    "description": "The Tse-tse Distribution Dataset shows Tsetse types distribution in\nAfrica for the years 1973 and 1981.  The Africa Tse-Tse distribution\ndataset was compiled by the Nairobi based International Labatories for\nResearch in Animal Diseases (ILRAD), now called International\nLivestock Research Institute (ILRI). This data was Collated from\ninformation supplied by the Interafrican Bureau of Animal Resources\n(IBAR) and the dataset developed as a project carried out for the\nOrganisation of African Unity-Scientific and Technical Research\nCommision (OAU/STRC).\n\nThe East Coast Fever dataset contains the following:\n\nThe Cattle and Buffalo distribution dataset shows cattle and buffalo\ndistribution for sub-Saharan, East and Central Africa.  It is part of\nthe East Coast Fever (ECF) dataset. The ECF study determined both\nareas at risk and potential migration of the disease by cattle and a\npotential pool of infection for transmitting the disease to domestic\ncattle by Buffalo.  Buffalo is the main wildlife host of the ECF. The\nstudy was carried out in Nairobi in collaboration with United Nations\nEnvironment Program, Global Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID)\nand the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases\n(ILRAD), now called International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI).\n\nThe Tick-suitability model which is part of East Coast Fever database,\nrepresents suitability for the R. Appendiculatus type.  It is part of\nthe East Coast Fever (ECF) dataset. This dataset is the result of a\nmodel (CLIMEX) which combined the factors climate and vegetation. The\nresult is a theoretical Tick suitability for the R. Appendiculatus\nwhich spread the East Coast Fever. This theoretical disrtibution was\ncompared to actual Tick collection sites (New-ID: NBI15). The study\nwas a colleboration between United Nations Environment\nProgramme-Global Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID) and the\nInternational Labatory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD), now\ncalled ILRI both in Nairobi.\n\nThe Tick distribution Dataset is part of the East Coast Fever dataset\nrepresenting tick collection sites in Africa.  It is part of the East\nCoast Fever (ECF) dataset. This dataset is produced by ILRAD experts\nfrom a hand-drawn interpolation from R. appendiculatus (East Coast\nFever spreading tick) based on collection sites (NBI15).  Areas above\n2300 meters are excluded (as defined by a 10' world elevation map).\nThe study was a collaboration between the Nairobi based United Nations\nEnvironment Programme-Global Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID)\nand the International Labatory for Research on Animal Diseases\n(ILRAD), now International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI).\n\nAfrica tick collection sites for Rhipicephalus: appendiculatus,\nduttoni, nittens, and zambeziens are part of the East Coast Fever\n(ECF) dataset. This dataset is the basis for the other Datasets like\nTick suitability model (CLIMEX) that combined the climate and\nvegetation factors.  It is a point dataset, where each point\nrepresents a Tick collection site. The theoretical distribution by the\nmodel was compared to this dataset for actual Tick collection\nsites. The study was a collaboration in Nairobi between United Nations\nEnvironment Programme, Global Resource Information Database\n(UNEP/GRID) and the International Labatory for Research on Animal\nDiseases (ILRAD), now called International Livestock Research\nInstitute (ILRI).\n\nUNEP_Metadata: nbid0013\nUNEP_Metadata: nbid0014\nUNEP_Metadata: nbid0015\nUNEP_Metadata: nbid0244\nUNEP_Metadata: nbid0245\nUNEP_Metadata: nbid0246\nUNEP_Metadata: nbid0247",
