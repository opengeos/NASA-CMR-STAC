    "description": "This data layer, which focuses on benthic communities, was developed\nas part of a cooperative project between the University of New Haven,\nthe Connecticut DEP, and the U.S.  Geological Survey. Benthic\ncommunities are an integral component of the ecology of Long Island\nSound.\n\nUnderstanding the role that spatial heterogeneity plays in the dynamic\nof benthic landscapes may be a key to developing a better\nunderstanding of the estuarine ecology and the impacts of human\nactivity. The purpose of providing this data layer is to help\nestablish a regional framework for developing a more extensive GIS for\nbenthic communities in Long Island Sound that can be used for\neducation, research, and environmental management.\n\nMapping was performed on a sidescan sonar survey. This survey was\nprocessed at 3,479-scale utilizing the U.S.G.S. Mini Image Processing\nsystem (MIPS) in an Equatorial Mercator Projection. Processing\nincluded bottom, ratio, and radiometric corrections; sectioning the\nsurvey area; \"Geoming\" individual map sections; \"stenciling\" and\n\"mosaicing\"; and building the final image. The shading convention for\nthis mosaic is that dark tones are interpreted as fine sediment (fine\nsand, silt and clay); and light tones are interpreted as coarse\nsediment. Rough and \"grainy\" patches are interpreted as glacial drift\nor bedrock outcrops.The image files contained here have been modified,\nusing Arc/Info software, from the three original TIFFs delivered by\nUniversity of Rhode Island. The images were converted to grids,\ngeo-referenced, and individually reclassified in a manner similar to\nlinear stretching to account for variations in gray scales among the\nthree sections of the mosaic. The grids were then converted back to\nTIFF format with world files in Latitude/Longitude decimal degrees (no\nprojection). Pixel size is approximately 0.8 meters.\n\nThe original studies were conducted to describe the benthic\ncommunities in Long Island Sound; the corresponding data layer is\npresented to show the extent of the sidescan sonar mosaic off New\nLondon, in eastern Long Island Sound, and the distribution of habitats\non the mosaic.\n\nThis data layer is an interpretation of the sidescan sonar mosaic from\nthe study area off New London, CT.",
