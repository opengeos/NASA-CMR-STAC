    "description": "The present dataset is part of the published scientific paper Gr\u0103dinaru, S. R., & Hersperger, A. M. (2019). Green infrastructure in strategic spatial plans: Evidence from European urban regions. Urban forestry & urban greening, 40, 17-28.  The goal of this research was to conduct a comparative analysis of the integration of green infrastructure concept in strategic spatial plans of European Urban regions. Specifically, the paper has the following objectivs: 1) which principles of GI planning are followed in strategic plans of urban regions? 2) can we identify different approaches to GI integration into strategic planning?. The study focues on a sample consisting of 14 case studies spanning 11 countries. We retrieved the strategic plans from the websites of the planning authorities. The list of the reviewed planning documents can be found in Appendix A of the paper. A protocol was developed to perform the content analysis of the strategic plans and gather the data. The detailed list of protocol items can be found in Appendix B of the paper.  The planning documents were read in order to address the protocol items. The answer to the protocol items in each of the first two categories (items 1\u201311) was documented as text, while the answer for the third category, namely items addressing the planning principles (items 12\u201336), was coded according to Table 1 of the article.  As a result, we provide the folowing outputs:  \u2022\tGI_Dataset_1_Items_1-12.xlsx \u2013 available on request  o\tResults of the coding on general aspects regarding the strategic plans of urban regions as well as extracts from each plan to justify the coding option \u2013 this data was derived from the coding procedure coresponding to items from 1 to 12 of the protocol. The data was discussed qualitativly in the research paper.   \u2022\tGI_Dataset_2_Items_12-36.csv \u2013 freely available   o\tResults of the coding  on principles of GI planning followed in strategic plans of urban regions\u2013 this data was derived from the coding procedure coresponding to items from 12 to 36 of the protocol. The data served as input for the classifications performed through hierarchical cluster analysis. This data is a detailed version of Appendix C in the paper.",
