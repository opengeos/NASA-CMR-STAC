    "description": "The following information was abstracted from a WRI Publications\n      announcement:\n      \n      Africa Data Sampler (ADS)\n      \n      The ADS is an internationally comparable set of digital maps at a scale of\n      1:1 million for every country in Africa. The ADS is an integration of map\n      data from several GIS databases. Roads, rivers, settlements,\n      topography, and other essential base map features were extracted from\n      the Arc/Info version of the Digital Chart of the World (ESRI, Redlands,\n      CA).  Data representing forests, wetlands, and protected areas from the\n      Biodiversity Map Library (World Conservation Monitoring Center,\n      Cambridge, UK), and sub-national boundaries and population estimates\n      from the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (Santa\n      Barbara, CA) were integrated with the DCW data sets.  Over twenty\n      layers of data are available for most countries.\n      \n      The ADS comprises a CD-ROM and User's Guide.  The CD-ROM contains\n      digital maps in PC ARC/INFO format for 53 countries in Robinson\n      projection, five sample views in ArcView 1 format for each country, and\n      ARC/INFO Export files for all countries in geographic projection.\n      The 150-page User's Guide is available in both English and French and\n      gives detailed information on the ADS data sources, data quality, and\n      applications.\n      \n      The Africa Data Sampler is available on CD-ROM usable in UNIX,\n      MS-DOS, or Macintosh environments. \n      For more information on WRI publicatons on Africa, please see:\n      http://www.wri.org/",
