    "description": "This is land use/land cover digital data collected by USGS and converted to\n            ARC/INFO by the EPA. This data is useful for environmental assessment of land\n            use patterns with respect to water quality analysis, growth management, and\n            other types of environmental impact assessment. Use may be limited due to\n            currency.\n            \n            Land use and land cover data LU/LC collected by the USGS NMD is useful for\n            environmental assessment of land use patterns with respect to water quality\n            analysis, growth management, and other types of environmental impact\n            assessment.\n            \n            Data are meant to be used by quadrangle, or among adjacent quadrangles\n            where temporally contiguous. Can be used in any geographic application where\n            intermediate scale land use data are appropriate and the dates are\n            representative.\n            \n            Each quadrangle of land use data has a different representative date. Date\n            ranges from mid 1970s to early 1980s are common. When joined together these\n            quadrangles will not likely match along edges due to differences in\n            interpretation and time coverage. Edges of each map file were manually\n            digitized and may not join neighboring maps. If GIRASNEAT program has been\n            applied (see LOG at end) then edges have been mathematically recalculated to\n            join without overlap or gaps in coverage with adjacent maps.\n            \n            The GIRAS series can include several themes of spatial data. The most\n            common, described here, is the land use and land cover data. Land use was\n            mapped and coded using the Anderson classification system (Anderson\n            others,1976) which is a hierarchical system of general (level 1) to more\n            specific (level 2) characterization. Some agencies have taken this to a level 3\n            classification -- but this has not been done in the GIRAS series.\n            \n            The salient attribute managed for this polygon data set in the polygon\n            attribute table (PAT) is the column named LUCODE containing the Anderson level\n            2 classification. The first digit represents the level one value and the second\n            digit (ones place) represents the subdivision of the level 1 or level 2 value.\n            \n            \n                The Anderson land use codes are:\n                 1 Urban or built-up land\n                11 Residential\n                12 Commercial and services\n                13 Industrial\n                14 Transportation, communication, utilities\n                15 Industrial and commercial complexes\n                16 Mixed urban or built-up land\n                17 Other urban or built-up land\n                 2 Agricultural land\n                21 Cropland and pasture\n                22 Orchards, groves, vineyards, nurseries, and\n                   ornamental horticultural\n                23 Confined feeeding operations\n                24 Other agricultural land\n                 3 Rangeland\n                31 Herbaceous rangeland\n                32 Shrub and brush rangeland\n                33 Mixed rangeland\n                 4 Forest land\n                41 Deciduous forest land\n                42 Evergreen forest land\n                43 Mixed forest land\n                 5 Water\n                51 Streams and canals\n                52 Lakes\n                53 Reservoirs\n                54 Bays and estuaries\n                 6 Wetland\n                61 Forested wetland\n                62 Nonforested wetland\n                 7 Barren land\n                71 Dry salt flats\n                72 Beaches\n                73 Sandy areas not beaches\n                74 Bare exposed rock\n                75 Strip mines, quarries, gravel pits\n                76 Transitional areas\n                 8 Tundra\n                81 Shrub and brush tundra\n                82 Herbaceous tundra\n                83 Bare ground\n                84 Wet tundra\n                85 Mixed tundra\n                 9 Perennial snow or ice\n                91 Perennial snowfields\n                92 Glaciers",
