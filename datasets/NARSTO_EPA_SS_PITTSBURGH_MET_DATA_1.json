    "description": "NARSTO_EPA_SS_PITTSBURGH_MET_DATA is the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Supersite (SS) Pittsburgh Meteorological Data product. It was obtained between July 1, 2001 and November 1, 2002 during the Pittsburgh Supersite Program. Ambient monitoring at the central super site and a set of satellite sites in the Pittsburgh region included numerous meteorological measurements. Meteorological parameters measured during the sampling period included temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, UV intensity, and solar intensity. The Pittsburgh Super Site Program was a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary investigation to characterize the ambient Particulate Matter (PM) in the Pittsburgh region, to improve understanding the links between ambient PM and public health, and to develop new instrumentation for PM measurements. The central super site was located next to the Carnegie Mellon University campus near downtown Pittsburgh. Five additional sites served as Satellite sites. The measurement campaign lasted for 18 months (May 2001-October 2002). \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives were to: Characterize the PM with regard to size, surface, and volume distribution; chemical composition as a function of size and on a single particle basis; temporal and spatial variability. Develop and evaluate the current and next generation atmospheric aerosol monitoring techniques including single particle measurements, continuous measurements, ultra-fine aerosol measurements, improved organic component characterization, and others. Quantify the impact of the various sources of PM concentrations in the area including transportation, power plants, natural, etc. Combine the ambient monitoring study with the proposed indoor, health, and modeling studies to elucidate of the links between PM characteristics and their health impacts in this area. \r\n\r\nThe EPA PM Super sites Program was an ambient air monitoring research program from 1999-2004 designed to provide information of value to the atmospheric sciences, and human health and exposure research communities. Eight geographically diverse projects were chosen to specifically address these EPA research priorities: (1) to characterize PM, its constituents, precursors, co-pollutants, atmospheric transport, and its source categories that affect the PM in any region; (2) to address the research questions and scientific uncertainties about PM source-receptor and exposure-health effects relationships; and (3) to compare and evaluate different methods of characterizing PM including testing new and emerging measurement methods. \r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
