    "description": "The data set was created to determine phreatophyte boundaries used in the\nreport, \"Ground-water discharge determined from estimates of\nevapotranspiration, Death Valley regional flow system, Nevada and California\".\n\n  The raster-based, color-infrared composite was derived from Landsat Thematic\nMapper imagery data acquired during June 1989 for the Sarcobatus Flat area of\nthe Death Valley regional flow system. The image is a single-channel,\nparallelepiped classification that when displayed using a 256-color color table\nshows a simulation of a color-infrared composite. The data set was used in\ndetermining phreatophyte boundaries for a ground-water evapotranspiration\nstudy.\n\n  The raster-based, color-infrared composite (CIR) was derived from Landsat\nThematic Mapper (TM) imagery data acquired during June 1989 for the Death\nValley regional flow system, Nevada and California.\n\n  The image is a single-channel, parallelepiped classification that when\ndisplayed using a 256-color color table shows a simulation of a color-infrared\ncomposite (Beverley and Penton, 1989). TM channels 2, 3, and 4 are used in the\nclassification process. The wavelengths of these channels correspond to those\nused for a CIR composite. The data range of each channel is divided into eight\ndivisions. The 512 possible combinations are then reduced to 256. A color table\nof red, green, and blue values is created for display of the image. Sixteen\npossible color values exist for each color. These values are scaled between 0\nand 255. The image is reduced from more than 16 million colors to 256 colors.\n\nReviews\n\nThe CIR image for 1989 was checked for consistency and accuracy during the data\nprocessing. Two external reviews were done. The reviewers were asked to check\nmetadata and other documentation files for completeness and accuracy. Reviewers\nalso were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances, projections,\nand geographic extent.\n\n  The Landsat Entity-identification number is LT5040034008917210.",
