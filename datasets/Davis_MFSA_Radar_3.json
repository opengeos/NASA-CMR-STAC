    "description": "This dataset contains wind speed and direction in the middle atmosphere above Davis, Antarctica. The radar runs continuously. Data are collected and stored every two minutes (excluding downtime for maintenance) for heights in the approximate range 50km to 110km at 2km intervals. Analysis of the source data yields parameters describing the strength and character of the radar echo and, when certain acceptance criteria are met, the wind speed. The requirement to meet acceptance criteria results in a data rate that may be less than the sampling rate. \n\nData collection began in 1994 and is ongoing.\n\nChanges to the polarisation of the transmitted radar pulse are used to maximise the range over which winds can be obtained, using the differing reflection and absorption characteristics of the ordinary and extraordinary modes. These have the potential to yield measures of electron density over the sampled height range. A combination of technical difficulties and unknown issues have meant that these data have not yielded results that are considered reliable.\n\nThe data set is standalone. MFSA stands for Medium Frequency Spaced Array. This is in reference to the transmitted frequency and the antenna configuration needed for Full Correlation Analysis (FCA).\n\nProject History:\nThe operation of the MFSA radar has supported a number of Antarctic Science Research projects. These include:\nProject 674 \u2013 \u2018Dynamical coupling in the Antarctic middle atmosphere\u2019. 1993/94 to 2011/12\nProject 4025 \u2013 \u2018Gravity wave drag parameterization in climate models\u2019. 2012/13 to 2016/17\nProject 4445 \u2013 \u2018High-latitude gravity wave processes and their parameterization in climate models\u2019 2017/18 to 2020/21\nFurther details of the outcomes of these projects can be found on the Antarctic Division website www.aad.gov.au. The data have also contributed to Australian and international research activities beyond these projects. Similar radars are/have been operated by other countries at Antarctic stations including Syowa (Japan), Rothera (UK), McMurdo (USA) and Scott Base (NZ).\n\nTechnical History:\nSummer 1993/94 \u2013 New radar equipment and existing equipment previously operating at Mawson station were installed at Davis. Operation and data collection began on 11 April 1994. This mode of operation used 8-bit digitisation of received signals, ongoing gain adjustment and polarization changes between (rather than within) data accumulation cycles.\nSummer 2000/2001 \u2013 An upgrade to the receiver and digitiser system removed the need for gain adjustment and introduced 12 bit digitisation. Polarisation changes within data accumulation cycles became possible. Operation began on 7 November 2000.\nSummer 2003/2004 - Replaced \u2018TOMCO\u2019 transmitter with 3rd generation ATRAD transmitter. \nSummer 2008/9 \u2013 Container laboratory replaced.\nFeb 2012 \u2013 Transmit antenna replaced. Replacement allows tap changes to improve tuning of antenna impedance.\n\n",
