    "description": "This data set provides the organochlorine content found in four sea-ice samples collected in the vicinity of Davis station over a three week period in 2014/15. Sea-ice is thought to serve as a reservoir for organochlorine pesticides during the winter. The aim of the study was to investigate the movement of organochlorine pesticides in the seasonal sea-ice during ice melt. A custom made, closed-system, ice melting unit, coupled to an in-situ water filter, was implemented for sampling. Minimal ice-melt or change in organchlorine content was found over the three week period. Changes were attributed to high ventilation of the sea-ice surface caused by high wind speeds found in the Antarctic compared to the Arctic.\n    \n4 sea-ice samples were collected in the vicinity of Davis station and contaminant profiles extracted and analysed. Caution should be taken in interpretation of data as the ice/water extraction unit failed during operation.",
