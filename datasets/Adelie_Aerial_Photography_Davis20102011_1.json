    "description": "Aerial photographs were taken at 16 islands between the Rauer Islands and the Amery Ice Shelf where occupancy surveys in 2009-10 and 2010-11 found breeding Adelie penguin populations. The photographs were taken to estimate the size of breeding Adelie penguin populations.\n\nThe survey was completed in a single mission from 09:53-13:44 UTC on the 20th November 2010. The flight was split into two parts and covered the Svenner and Steinnes islands first, with a stop in the Larsemann Hills for refueling at Progress I, then further surveying around Lichen Island. Weather conditions during the flight were sunny. This resulted in substantial areas being in shadow.\n\nPart 1 of the flight mission: Svenner, Svenner south-east, Svenner south and Steinnes islands\n\nVertical photos were taken along the flight lines from a Squirrel AS350BA helicopter (VH-SES) flying at 80 knots and 750m altitude using a Hasselblad H3DII-50 camera with a 150 mm lens and 1/800th second shutter speed. A 3-second shutter closure interval was achieved using an SDK and intervalometer. The camera auto-focussed effectively at infinity using the software Phocus.",
