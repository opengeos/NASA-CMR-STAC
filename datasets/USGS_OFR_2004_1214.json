    "description": "Field and laboratory studies were conducted to determine the effects of\npesticide mixtures on Chinook salmon under various environmental conditions in\nsurface waters of the northern Central Valley of California. This project was a\ncollaborative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the\nUniversity of California. The project focused on understanding the\nenvironmental factors that influence the toxicity of pesticides to juvenile\nsalmon and their prey. During the periods January through March 2001 and\nJanuary through May 2002, water samples were collected at eight surface water\nsites in the northern Central Valley of California and analyzed by the USGS for\ndissolved pesticide and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Water samples\nwere also collected by the USGS at the same sites for aquatic toxicity testing\nby the Aquatic Toxicity Laboratory at the University of California Davis;\nhowever, presentation of the results of these toxicity tests is beyond the\nscope of this report. Samples were collected to characterize dissolved\npesticide and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and aquatic toxicity,\nassociated with winter storm runoff concurrent with winter run Chinook salmon\nout-migration. Sites were selected that represented the primary habitat of\njuvenile Chinook salmon and included major tributaries within the Sacramento\nand San Joaquin River Basins and the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta. Water\nsamples were collected daily for a period of seven days during two winter storm\nevents in each year. Additional samples were collected weekly during January\nthrough April or May in both years. Concentrations of 31 currently used\npesticides were measured in filtered water samples using solid-phase extraction\nand gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at the U.S. Geological Survey's\norganic chemistry laboratory in Sacramento, California. Dissolved organic\ncarbon concentrations were analyzed in filtered water samples using a Shimadzu\nTOC-5000A total organic carbon analyzer.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
