    "description": "Samples are from the SRE4 experiment - an in situ experiment to determine fate and effects of different types of oils in the Antarctic marine environment.  For details see: Powell S.M., Snape I., Bowman J.P., Thompson B.A.W., Stark J.S., McCammon S.A., Riddle M.J.  2005.  A comparison of the short term effects of diesel fuel and lubricant oils on Antarctic benthic microbial communities.  Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 322:53-65.\n\nSamples were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with primers specific for the Gammaproteobacteria.\n\nSamples used were from Time2 (1 year)\nInitial: T-1C; T-1E\nControl: T2C\nSAB treatment: T2S\n\nPCR conditions: \nPrimers: GAMFC: CGC CCG CCG CGC CCC GCG CCC GGC CCG CCG CCC CCG CCC GGG\nTTA ATC GGA ATT ACT GG\nGAMR:   GGT AAG GTT CTT CGC GTT GCA T\n\n50 ul (micro litre) reactions with HotStar (qiagen) mix, 5ul Q solution, 10 pmol (pico mol) each primer and 20 ng (nano gram) template DNA\n\ncycling:        94C 15 minutes\n35 cycles of:\n\n94C 1 minutes\n55C 1 minutes\n72C 1 minutes\n72C 20 minutes\n\nDGGE was performed using D-Code system (BioRad).\nGel: 8% acryloamide, 30 - 65% denaturant with 2 cm stacking gel\n1 x TAE, 60 degrees C, 80V 16 hours\nGel was pre-run for 20 minutes and lanes were flushed out after 15 minutes.\nGel was stained with Sybrgold.          \nImage captured using Storm Phosphorimager and ImageQuant v5.2 software (.gel files).   The image files are called 151105#2.gel and 151105.tif\n\nBand pattern results are in gammadgge.xls. The first column is the band position (or band name) and the remaining columns are samples with the first row being the sample name. The numbers indicates how many times the band appeared for that sample out of 2 DGGE runs.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 1228 and 2201 (ASAC_1228, ASAC_2201).",
