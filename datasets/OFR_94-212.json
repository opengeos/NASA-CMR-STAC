    "description": "Airborne monitoring of Mount St. Helens by the USGS began in May 1980 for\nsulfur dioxide emissions and in July 1980 for carbon dioxide emissions.  A\ncorrelation spectrometer, or COSPEC, was used to measure sulfur dioxide in\nMount St. Helens' plume.  The upward-looking COSPEC was mounted in a     \nfixed-wing aircraft and flown below and at right angles to the plume.\nTypically, three to six traverses were made underneath the plume to determine\nthe SO2 burden (concentration x  pathlength) within a cross-section of the\nplume.  Knowing the burden along with the plume width and plume velocity\n(assumed to be the same as ambient wind speed), we could then calculate the\nemission rate of SO2.  The use of correlation spectroscopy for determining the\nsulfur dioxide output of volcanoes is well established and the technique has\nbeen discussed in detail by a number of investigators (Malinconico, 1979;\nCasadevall and others, 1981; Stoiber and others, 1983).\n\n Carbon dioxide in the Mount St. Helens plume was measured by an infrared\nspectrometer tuned to the 4.26 um CO2 absorption band.  An external sample tube\nwas attached to the fuselage of a twin-engine aircraft to deliver outside air\nto the gas cell of the spectrometer.  The aircraft was then flown at several\ndifferent elevations through the plume at right angles to plume trajectory to\ndefine plume area and carbon dioxide concentration in a vertical cross-section\nof the plume.  These two parameters along with the density of CO2 for the\naltitude of the plume and the plume velocity (assumed as above to be equal to\nambient wind speed) were then used to calculate the CO2 emission rate (Harris\nand others, 1981).",
