    "description": "Chemical, physical, profile, imagery, laboratory analysis and sediment analysis oceanographic data were collected aboard the GYRE in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-09-19 to 2010-09-28 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include Carbon - Total Organic, Metals, Semivolatile Organic Compounds, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH), Volatile Organic Compounds and sediment properties. The instruments used to collect these data included bottle and sediment sampler - corer along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. Sediment cores were analyzed for physical characteristics, and recorded in photos and data files. The analytical chemistry data are provisional and provide results of onshore laboratory analysis of water and sediment samples. Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers.
