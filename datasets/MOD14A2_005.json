    "description": "The MOD14A2.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nMODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products are primarily derived from MODIS 4- and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are employed to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline.\r\n\r\nMOD14A2 data are 8-day fire-mask composites at 1-kilometer resolution provided as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Science Data Sets include the fire-mask and algorithm quality.\r\n\r\nThe Terra MODIS instrument acquires data twice daily (10:30 AM and PM), as does the Aqua MODIS (1:30 PM and AM). These four daily MODIS fire observations serve to advance global monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS Thermal Anomalies & Fire products have attained Validation Stage 3, which was completed using active fire reference data that were derived from ASTER and Landsat-5 TM (30 m resolution) data sources.\r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nInternal HDF compression reduces products to ~5% of their uncompressed size\r\nSDS \"most confident detected fire\" renamed as \"FireMask\"\r\nReduced 32-bit QA to simpler 8-bit layer\r\nAdded global HDF attributes to simplify use of tile-level QA\r\nMore: Collection 5 Change Summary for MODIS Active Fire Algorithm and Products (http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/QA_WWW/forPage/C005_Change_Fire.pdf)\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: February 26, 2000 - March 29, 2017\r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long\r\nFile Size: ~0.04 MB \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 1000 meters \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 2",
