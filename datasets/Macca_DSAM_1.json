    "description": "The Macquarie Island Station Area GIS Dataset is a topographic and facilities data base covering Australia's Macquarie Island Station and its immediate environs. The database includes all man made and natural features within the operational area of the station proper. Attributes are held for many facilities including, buildings, site services, communications, fuel storage, aeronautical and management zones. The spatial data have been compiled from low level aerial photography, ground surveys and engineering plans. Detail attribution of hydraulic site services includes make, size and engineering plan number.\n\nThe dataset conforms to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information.\n\nThe data is included in the data available for download from a Related URL below.\nThe data conforms to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See a Related URL below.\nData described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 25.\nEach feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets & quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature.\n\nChanges have occurred at the station since this dataset was produced. For example some buildings and other structures have been removed and some added.\nAs a result the data available for download from a Related URL below is updated with new data having different Dataset_id(s).",
