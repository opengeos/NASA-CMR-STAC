    "description": "The incidental take of marine birds was estimated for the following North\nPacific driftnet fisheries in 1990: Japanese squid, Japanese large-mesh, Korean\nsquid, and Taiwanese squid and large-mesh combined. The take was estimated by\nassuming that the data represented a random sample from an unstratified\npopulation of all driftnet fisheries in the North Pacific. Estimates for 13\nspecies or species groups are presented, along with some discussion of\ninadequacies of the design. About 416,000 marine birds were estimated to be\ntaken incidentally during the 1990 season; 80 % of these were in the Japanese\nsquid fishery. Sooty Shearwaters, Short-tailed Shearwaters, and Laysan\nAlbatrosses were the most common species in the bycatch.\n\nRegression models were also developed to explore the relations between bycatch\nrate of three groups Black-footed Albatross, Laysan Albatross, and \"dark\"\nshearwatersand various explanatory variables, such as latitude, longitude,\nmonth, vessel, sea surface temperature, and net soak time (length of time nets\nwere in the water). This was done for only the Japanese squid fishery, for\nwhich the most complete information was available. For modeling purposes,\nfishing operations for each vessel were grouped into 5-degree blocks of\nlatitude and longitude.\n\nResults of model building indicated that vessel had a significant influence on\nbycatch rates of all three groups. This finding emphasizes the importance of\nthe sample of vessels being representative of the entire fleet. In addition,\nbycatch rates of all three groups varied spatially and temporally. Bycatch\nrates for Laysan Albatrosses tended to decline during the fishing season,\nwhereas those for Black-footed Albatrosses and dark shearwaters tended to\nincrease as the season progressed. Bycatch rates were positively related to net\nsoak time for Laysan Albatrosses and dark shearwaters. Bycatch rates of dark\nshearwaters were lower for higher sea surface temperatures.",
