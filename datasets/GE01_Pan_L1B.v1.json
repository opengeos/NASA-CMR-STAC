    "description": "The GeoEye-1 Level 1B Panchromatic Imagery collection contains satellite imagery acquired from Maxar Technologies (formerly known as DigitalGlobe) by the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program. Imagery is collected by the GeoEye-1 satellite using the GeoEye-1 Imaging System across the global land surface from September 2008 to the present. This data product includes panchromatic imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.46m at nadir (0.41m before summer 2013) and a temporal resolution of approximately 3 days. The data are provided in National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) and GeoTIFF formats. This level 1B data is sensor corrected and is an un-projected (raw) product. The data potentially serve a wide variety of applications that require high resolution imagery. Data access is restricted based on a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) license, and investigators must be approved by the CSDA Program.",
