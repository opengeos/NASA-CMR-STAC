    "description": "The MYD11C1.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua LST/E L3 Global CMG (Short name: MYD11C1) products incorporate 0.05 degree (5600 meters at the equator) pixels, which are derived from the MOD11B1 daily global 6 km grid product, and stored in a 0.05 degree geographic CMG. They are produced daily using the day/night LST algorithm, which extracts average temperatures (in Kelvin) and applies them to a pair of MODIS daytime and nighttime observations. This method yields 1 K accuracy for materials with known emissivities. The six thermal Band emissivities are retrieved through the day/night algorithm. Prior to reprojecting the MYD11C1, cloud-contaminated LSTs (daytime and nighttime) are removed by a double-screening method. Further details are available in Wan et al. (2002).\r\n\r\nThe MYD11C1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and emissivities for Bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32.\r\n\r\nThe V5 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11C1, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\r\n\r\nWan, ZM, Zhang, YL, Zhang, QC, Li, ZL (2002). Validation of the land-surface temperature products retrieved from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT, 83(2-Jan), 163-180.\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\n\r\nThe V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.
