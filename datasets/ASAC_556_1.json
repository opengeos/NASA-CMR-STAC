    "description": "Underwater recordings of vocalisations of Weddell seals were obtained at 8 locations within the Vestfold Hills (7) and Larsemann Hills (1).  The recordings were made near groups of seals on the ice during the mid to late part of the breeding season.  Recordings were obtained using a variety of hydrophones and both Sony Digital Audio Tape (130 during 1992 season) and standard analogue cassette (60 during 1991 season) formats.  Over 11,000 vocalizations were analyzed. The calls were classified into 12 major call types (Pahl et al. 1997 Australian Journal of Zoology 45:171-187).  The underwater repertoire is different than that of the seals at McMurdo Sound or the Palmer Penninsula (Thomas et al. 1988 Hydrobiologica 165:279-284).  The Weddell seals at the Vestfold Hills do not exhibit the between-fjord vocal differences reported by Morrice et al. (1994 Polar Biology 14:441-446).  The relative usage of each call type did not vary between the earlier and later recordings (Pahl et al. 1996 Australian Journal of Zoology 44:75-79).  The recordings are currently being used to support other studies on Weddell seal vocalizations.\n\nLegend for ASAC_556.csv - csv text format.\n\nThe following legend describes the 39 variables in this file.  The codes for some of the variables are presented in the 1997 publication:\n\nPahl, B.C., Terhune, J.M., and Burton, H.R. 1997.  Repertoire and geographic variation in underwater vocalisations of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, Pinnipedia: Phocidae) at the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica.

These were subsequently classified into 13 broad categories (Pahl et al. 1997).  The amalgamation of the provisional call types of variable 6 into the 50 call types presented in Pahl et al.
