    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the city of Columbia, Missouri,\nand the Missouri Department of Conservation, collected ground-water quality\ndata from June 1999 through August 2005, surface-water quality data from August\n1999 through August 2003, and water-level data from February 2004 through\nAugust 2005 in McBaine Bottoms, southwest of Columbia. McBaine Bottoms,\nadjacent to the Missouri River, is the location of the municipal-supply well\nfield for the city of Columbia, the city of Columbia wastewater-treatment\nwetlands, and the Missouri Department of Conservation Eagle Bluffs Conservation\nArea.\n\nThis report presents water-quality data, which include water-quality analyses\nof samples collected from 36 water-quality sampling sites (31 were wells and 5\nwere surface-water sites), and ground-water level data, which include\nwater-level measurements from more than 80 wells. Water samples were analyzed\nfor physical properties, inorganic chemical constituents, nutrients, and\ndissolved iron. Selected samples were analyzed for trace elements, wastewater\norganic compounds, and pesticides.\n\nIn samples from monitoring wells, chloride concentrations ranged from 2.41 to\n259 mg/L (milligrams per liter), sodium concentrations ranged from 1.08 to 175\nmg/L, and sulfate concentrations ranged from less than 0.2 to 271 mg/L (all\nconcentrations were dissolved). Dissolved nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen\nconcentrations ranged from less than 0.05 to 0.46 mg/L. Total phosphorous\nconcentrations ranged from less than 0.04 to 1.68 mg/L, dissolved phosphorous\nconcentrations ranged from less than 0.04 to 1.50 mg/L, and dissolved\northophosphorous concentrations ranged from less than 0.01 to 1.83 mg/L.\nDissolved iron concentrations ranged from less than 6 to 42,900 g/L (micrograms\nper liter). Dissolved arsenic concentrations in samples from two monitoring\nwells ranged from 11 to 37 g/L.\n\nIn samples from surface-water sampling sites, chloride concentrations ranged\nfrom 8.67 to 289 mg/L, sodium concentrations ranged from 6.18 to 219 mg/L, and\nsulfate concentrations ranged from 33.4 to 119 mg/L. All of the minimum\nconcentrations were detected in samples from Perche Creek. Dissolved nitrite\nplus nitrate as nitrogen concentrations ranged from less than 0.05 to 1.53\nmg/L. Total phosphorous concentrations ranged from 0.07 to 3.06 mg/L, dissolved\nphosphorous concentrations ranged from less than 0.05 to 2.88 mg/L, and\ndissolved orthophosphorous concentrations ranged from less than 0.01 to 2.86\nmg/L. Most of the maximum concentrations were detected in samples from the city\noutflow.\n\nMore than 35 wastewater organic compounds and pesticides were detected in\nsamples from the city outflow. However, most concentrations were estimated or\ntheir presence verified, but not quantified.\n\nWater levels in monitoring wells ranged from 548.54 to 576.55 ft (feet) above\nthe National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29). The difference in water\nlevels from February 2004 to August 2005 ranged from 0.13 ft to 10.97 ft.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
