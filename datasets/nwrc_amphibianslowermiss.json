    "description": "Bottomland hardwood forests are floodplain forests distributed along\nrivers and streams throughout the central and southern United States.\nThe largest bottomland hardwood ecosystem in North America occurred\nwithin the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMAV).  By the\n1980.s, an estimated 80% of the former 10 million ha of bottomland\nhardwood forest in the LMAV were cleared for flood control efforts,\nagriculture, and development.  Forests are continuing to be cleared\ntoday at an alarming rate, and the forests that remain are highly\ndegraded and fragmented.  In addition, these forests are subjected to\nextreme hydrological alterations.  Over the past few decades,\nextensive efforts have begun to reforest marginal agricultural lands\nwithin the LMAV.  Restoration efforts are limited by the lack of\ninformation concerning the habitat needs of bottomland wildlife\nspecies.  Amphibians are one group of species for which little is\nknown about their population status or habitat requirements in the\nLMAV.  Information concerning the population status of amphibians in\nthe LMAV is especially important since amphibians appear to be\ndeclining worldwide.  Amphibians may also be important indicators of\nenvironmental health because of their sensitivity to land management\npractices and water quality.  Understanding the habitat requirements\nof amphibians can be a step toward enhancing wildlife populations\nwithin the LMAV by providing valuable information for improving land\nmanagement practices and wetland restoration techniques.\n\nTo provide an inventory of amphibians at Tensas River and Lake Ophelia\nNational Wildlife Refuges.  In addition, to determine amphibian\ndistribution patterns in the LMAV as they relate to landscape habitat\nfeatures.  Research results will be used to develop reports and\nmanuscripts, and to assist land managers in management decisions to\nbenefit amphibian populations.\n\nInformation was obtained from Janene Lichtenberg for this metadata.",
