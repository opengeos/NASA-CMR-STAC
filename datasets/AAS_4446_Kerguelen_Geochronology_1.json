    "description": "40Ar/39Ar geochronology data of basalt samples from the Kerguelen Plateau and Broken Ridge\n\nThe samples include basalts from ODP drilling cores and dredge sites. The drilling core samples were stored in the Kochi Core Centre, Japan and the dredged samples were stored in the National Museum of Natural History, France.\n\nAnalytical methods of the 40Ar/39Ar geochronology data:\n\nSamples were crushed and minerals/groundmass were separated using a Frantz magnetic separator. Plagioclase, pyroxene, amphibole, sericite, and basaltic glass crystals and groundmass were separated from either the 125\u2013212 \u03bcm or the 212\u2013355 \u03bcm size fractions using a Frantz isodynamic magnetic separator. Minerals and groundmass were subsequently hand-picked grain-by-grain under a binocular stereomicroscope. Plagioclase and groundmass were further leached using diluted HF (2N) for 5 minutes and thoroughly rinsed in distilled water. Samples were loaded into several large wells of 1.9cm diameter and 0.3 cm depth aluminium discs. The discs were Cd-shielded to minimise undesirable nuclear interference re-actions and irradiated for 40 hours in the Oregon State University nuclear reactor (USA) in the central position. The samples were irradiated alongside FCs and GA1550 standards, for which ages of 28.294 \u00b1 0.037 Ma and 99.738 \u00b1 0.100 Ma were used, respectively.\n\nThe 40Ar/39Ar analyses were performed at the Western Australian Argon Isotope Facility at Curtin University. The samples were step-heated using a continuous 100 W PhotonMachine\u00a9 CO2 (IR, 10.4 \u00b5m) laser fired on the crystals during 60 seconds. Each of the standard crystals was fused in a single step. The gas was purified in an extra low-volume stainless steel extraction line of 240cc and using one SAES AP10 and one GP50 getter. Ar isotopes were measured in static mode using a low volume (600 cc) ARGUS VI mass spectrometer from Thermofisher\u00a9 set with a permanent resolution of ~200. Measurements were carried out in multi-collection mode using four faradays to measure mass 40 to 37 and a 0-background compact discrete dynode ion counter to measure mass 36. We measured the relative abundance of each mass simultaneously using 10 cycles of peak-hopping and 33 seconds of integration time for each mass. Detectors were calibrated to each other electronically and using air shot beam signals. The raw data were processed using the ArArCALC software.\n\nThe criteria for the determination of plateau are as follows: plateaus must include at least 70% of 39Ar released. The plateau should be distributed over a minimum of 3 consecutive steps agreeing at 95% confidence level and satisfying a probability of fit (P) of at least 0.05. Plateau ages are given at the 2\u03c3 level and are calculated using the mean of all the plateau steps, each weighted by the inverse variance of their individual analytical error. Uncertainties include analytical and J-value errors.",
