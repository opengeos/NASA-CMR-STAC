    "description": "The dataset comprises photographic images of seabird breeding colonies from cameras at multiple breeding sites across east Antarctic. Once deployed, the cameras operate continuously throughout the year and over multiple years but are programmed to take photographs on different schedules depending on the seabird species. The species include Adelie penguins, emperor penguins, Southern fulmars, Antarctic petrels, Cape petrels and Southern giant petrels. The cameras were positioned to include approximately 10-50 nests in the field of view. Photographs are taken frequently during the breeding season (1-10 photographs per day from October to March) and infrequently during the non-breeding season (1 photograph per week from March to October). Photographs are named by location, date and time (but not species).\n\nThe first cameras were deployed in November 2005 and the last camera was deployed in January 2012. Image acquisition is ongoing.\n\nCameras have been placed at:\n\nBechervaise Island, Mawson region (2 cameras, Adelie penguins)\nWelch Island, Mawson region (3 cameras, Adelie penguins)\nVerner Island, Mawson region (1 camera, Adelie penguins)\nPetersen Island, Mawson region (2 cameras, Adelie penguins)\nUnnamed Island, Mawson region (1 camera, Adelie penguins)\nUnnamed Island, Mawson region (1 camera, Cape petrel)\nTaylor Glacier, Mawson region (2 cameras, emperor penguins)\nGardner Island, Davis region (3 cameras, Adelie penguins)\nMagnetic Island, Davis region (2 cameras, Adelie penguins)\nHop Island, Davis region (1 camera, Adelie penguins; 2 cameras, Southern fulmars; 1 camera, Antarctic petrel)\nHawker Island, Davis region (3 cameras, Southern Giant Petrel)\nAmanda Bay, Davis region (3 cameras, emperor penguins)\nWhitney Point, Casey region (2 cameras, Adelie penguins)\nBlakeney Point, Casey region (1 camera, Adelie penguins)\nShirley Island, Casey region (1 camera, Adelie penguins)\nOdbert Island, Casey region (1 camera, Adelie penguins)\nArdery Island, Casey region (2 cameras, Southern fulmars; 2 cameras, Cape petrel)\nNelly Island, Casey region (4 cameras, Southern giant petrel)\nCape Denison, Commonwealth Bay region (1 camera, Adelie penguins)",
