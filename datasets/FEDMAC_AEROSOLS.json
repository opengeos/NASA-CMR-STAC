    "description": "     Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Multisensor Airborne Campaign (FED MAC):\n      Aerosol Optical Thickness\n      \n      The Biospheric Sciences Branch (formerly Earth Resources Branch)\n      within the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space\n      Flight Center and associated University investigators are involved in\n      a research program entitled Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) which is\n      fundamentally concerned with vegetation change of forest ecosystems at\n      local to regional spatial scales (100 to 10,000 meters) and temporal\n      scales ranging from monthly to decadal periods (10 to 100 years). The\n      nature and extent of the impacts of these changes, as well as the\n      feedbacks to global climate, may be addressed through modeling the\n      interactions of the vegetation, soil, and energy components of the\n      boreal ecosystem.\n      \n      Measurement of atmospheric attenuation and hence estimate of the\n      aerosol optical thickness were made in the Northern Experimental\n      Forest (NEF) in Howland, Maine, with sunphotometers. This parameter is\n      useful in calibration and correction of other measurements made with\n      remote sensing instruments at FED sites.  Measurements were made with the\n      eight channel sun-photometer named SXM-2 (440, 522, 613, 672, 781, 871\n      and 1030 nm with 10 nm FWHM) located on the ground. It tracks the\n      sun automatically using a 4 quadrant detector. The detector is a\n      silicon photodiode which is kept at a constant temperature. The\n      instrument has a 1.5 degree field-of-view.\n     \n      The FED Home Page is at: \"https://forest.gsfc.nasa.gov/\".\n",
