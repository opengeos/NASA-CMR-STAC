    "description": "Atmospheric volatile organic compounds in the marine boundary layer was monitored from July 14 to September 24 by the PTR-TOF-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer) along the cruise track of R/V Araon from Incheon to Incheon carrying out a series expeditions in the Northwestern Pacific and the Arctic Ocean. The air inlet to the instrument was located at 29 m asl and the species were measured at tens minutes.\nAtmospheric VOCs take part in tropospheric chemistry in particular related to the oxidation chemical processes in the marine boundary layer. This oxidation chemistry produces aerosol precursors and oxidative radicals which can further involve in the chemistry, which may lead to the control of atmospheric oxidation capacity and radiation budget. To understand these processes we measured VOCs in the marine boundary layer.",
