    "description": "The MCD15A2.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \n\nThe level-4 MODIS global Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) product is composited every 8 days at 1-kilometer resolution on a Sinusoidal grid. The MCD15A2 product includes the following Science Data Sets: LAI, FPAR, and a set of quality rating, and standard deviation layers for each variable.\n\nThe LAI variable defines the number of equivalent layers of leaves relative to a unit of ground area, whereas FPAR measures the proportion of available radiation in the photosynthetically-active wavelengths that are absorbed by green vegetation. Both variables are used as satellite-derived parameters to calculate surface photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and net primary production, which inputs are used to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water-cycle processes, and vegetation biogeochemistry.\n\nChange Points of Interest\n\nAlgorithm refinements were targeted to improve quality of LAI/FPAR retrievals, and consistency with field measurements over all biomes, but with major focus on woody vegetation.\nOld 6-biome LAI/FPAR map was replaced with a new 8-biome map (broadleaf and needleleaf forest classes were split into deciduous and evergreen subclasses)\nLAI/FPAR algorithm LUTs refined for all 8 biomes\nReduced file volume through internal compression\nAdditional V005 LAI/FPAR changes: http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/QA_WWW/forPage/C005_Changes_LAI_FPAR.pdf\n\nV005 Data Set Characteristics:\nTemporal Coverage: July 4, 2002 \u2013 March 29, 2017 \nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \nSpatial Resolution: 1 km \nFile Size: 2 MB\nResolution: ~1000 meters \nProjection: Sinusoidal \nData Format: HDF-EOS\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 6",
