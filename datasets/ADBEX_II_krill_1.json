    "description": "This dataset contains results from the Antarctic Division BIOMASS Experiment II (ADBEX II) cruise of the Nella Dan.  This is the third cruise of six, and follows the ADBEX I cruise made during late 1982. ADBEX II was to have been an international experiment, Second International BIOMASS Experiment I (SIBEX I), in cooperation with Japan, South Africa and France, however due to the delay of a supply program Australia's participation was cancelled. ADBEX II is the result of a reduced sampling program carried out during the resupply of Davis and Mawson stations. Surveys of krill and other zooplankton were taken off Antarctica in the Australian sector (Mawson to Davis region) and Prydz Bay in January 1984. Species identity and abundance data were obtained. The major species investigated were Euphausia superba, Euphausia frigidia, Euphausia crystallorophias and Thysanoessa marcuria. Other pteropods and cephalopods were also studied. Results from hydroacoustic surveys of krill biomass were also obtained, as well as CTD and chlorophyll data. Summary results are listed in the documentation.",
