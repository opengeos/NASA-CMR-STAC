    "description": "These data describe the locations, dates, time, etc where biogeochemistry data were collected on the CEAMARC-CASO cruise in the 2007/2008 Antarctic season.\n\nSee the CEAMARC-CASO events metadata record for further information.\n\nSample codes are not descriptive.  \nCEMARC/CASO column have underway data (no link to group site) as well as the CEAMARC and CASO sampling locations.\nEvents are recorded by number and the associated type of sample taken.  \nCTD - 0.4 um filtered water sample. \nBox corer - diatom scrape.\nBeam Trawl AAD - sponge sample.\nPHY - phytoplankton sample taken from inline surface seawater system.\nVan Veen grab - sediment scrape.\nWAT - surface water sample passed through 0.4 um filter.\nDescription column explains the samples in more detail - eg information on what size fraction the phytoplankton were filtered at.\nLitres column describes the volume of water that was filtered.\nDepth is in metres.\nTime is local time.\nTemperature is degrees C.\nStorage location was for shipboard use only.  The \"other\" column details any extra information that may be useful to the sample for example #2153 refers to a sample id code that the French CEAMARC group was using to code for their samples.\n\nOur aim for this voyage was to collect surface phytoplankton and water samples across a transect of the Southern Ocean, and to collect benthic sponge and coral samples in Antarctica, to (i) measure the Ge/Si and Si isotope composition to construct a nutrient profile across the Southern Ocean, and to test and calibrate these parameters as proxies for silica utilisation; and (ii) measure the B isotope composition to test the potential of biogenic silica to be used as a seawater pH proxy.  \n\nWe collected phytoplankton, sponges, diatom sediment scrapes and water samples at strategic locations to ensure that the entire water column was surveyed.  The data that were collected were used in collaboration with palaeoenvironmental data from sediment cores and experimental culture experiments on diatoms and sponges to gain a better understanding of historical distributions of Silicon and pH in the Southern Ocean.",
