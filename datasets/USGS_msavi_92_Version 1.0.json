    "description": "The data set was created to determine areas of regional plant-cover\ninformation for use in the report \"Ground-water discharge determined from\nestimates of evapotranspiration, Death Valley regional flow system, Nevada and\nCalifornia.\"\n\nThe raster-based Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index was derived from\nLandsat Thematic Mapper imagery data acquired during June 1992 for the Death\nValley regional flow system. The index has been shown to increase the dynamic\nrange of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background\ninfluences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a\n\"vegetation signal\" to \"soil noise\" ratio. The data set was used in determining\nphreatophyte boundaries for a ground-water evapotranspiration study and\nrelative differences in vegetation density between discharge areas.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe raster-based Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) was derived\nfrom Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery data acquired during June 1992 for\nthe Death Valley regional flow system. Background and formulas of the MSAVI are\ndetailed in Qi and others (1994).\n\nThe MSAVI has been shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal\nwhile further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater\nvegetation sensitivity as defined by a \"vegetation signal\" to \"soil noise\"\nratio. The MSAVI is a type of Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). The SAVI\nincludes a constant soil adjustment factor L. The MSAVI uses the Normalized\nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Weighted Difference Vegetation Index\n(WDVI) to compute the L value in the SAVI for each picture element or pixel.\nThis is referred to as a self-adjusting L function in Qi and others (1994, p.\n123). The slope of the soil line used in the equations was 1.06. This was used\nby Qi and others (1994, p. 123) and was determined to be an acceptable value\nfor this study.\n\nReviews\n\nThe MSAVI image for 1992 was checked for consistency and accuracy during the\ndata processing. Two external reviews were done. The reviewers were asked to\ncheck metadata and other documentation files for completeness and accuracy.\nReviewers also were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,\nprojections, and geographic extent.",
