    "description": "This data set characterizes snow microstructure for 6 snow pits from the SnowEx 2020 Grand Mesa Intensive Observation Period (February 2020) using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Included with this data set are two- and three-dimensional microstructural analysis of DMP/DEP casted and un-casted snow samples, available as .xlsx and .txt file, and visual representations of the three-dimensional snow structure, available is .bmp image files. Containers of snow were collected at 6 snow pits in approximately 17 cm intervals. There were approximately 5-8 discrete containers per pit and each container had an ~2 cm overlap with the sample below. A 6-cm section of snow was dissected from each container of snow, which were analyzed in ~2 cm sub-sections. Each sub-section was scanned in three intervals using a micro-CT instrument. The three interval scans comprise multiple slices, and were combined into the reconstructed final scan used for calculating the snow microstructural data.",
