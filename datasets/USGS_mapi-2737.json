    "description": "The map is an educational tool with which to inform the public about the\nexistence and the broad, regional nature of earthquake hazard in the Northeast.\nThe data were created digitally in order to ease and speed production and\npublication of the map. Text on the map cautions against using the map for\nscientific or engineering purposes, or to estimate hazard in small areas or at\nsingle sites. Entries in Lineage under Data_Quality_Information explain the\nreasons for this caution (see also Wheeler, 2000; reference in Lineage).\n\n The earthquake catalog was constructed in such a way that it should not be\nutilized in scientific, engineering, or hazards use (Wheeler, 2000; reference\nin Lineage). Accordingly, the catalog is not being published separately, in\norder to minimize the potential for misuse. It is available only as part of the\ndigital files from which the entire map was made.\n\nThe data are those used to make a large-format, colored map of earthquakes in\nthe northeastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada and the Atlantic\nOcean (Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler and others, 2001; references in\nData_Quality_Information, Lineage).  The map shows the locations of 1,069 known\nearthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or larger, and is designed for a non-technical\naudience. Colored circles represent earthquake locations, colored and sized by\nmagnitude. Short descriptions, colonial-era woodcuts, newspaper headlines, and\nphotographs summarize the dates, times of day, damage, and other effects of\nnotable earthquakes. The base map shows color-coded elevation, shaded to\nemphasize relief.\n\nThis metadata record describes the data on earthquakes and topography. Other\ndata, such as for roads and urban areas, were obtained elsewhere and we lack\nmetadata for them. Instead, this field cites the sources of these data that\nwere obtained elsewhere.",
