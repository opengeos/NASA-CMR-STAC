    "description": "NARSTO_NE_MODEL is the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) 1998 Model-Intercomparison Study Verification Data: NARSTO-Northeast 1995 Surface Ozone, NO, and NOx Langley Data Center Data Set. It supports the NARSTO Model Intercomparison activity described in the report of a workshop that was held in Washington, DC on May 27-28, 1998. The intercomparison activity will compare meteorological, emissions, and air quality models that are used to estimate ozone concentrations in the northeastern United States. The air quality models are used to estimate how ambient ozone concentrations will change in response to changes in VOC and NOx emissions. These data are a subset of the measurements made during the NARSTO-Northeast 1995 intensive field campaign and will be used to verify model predictions. Included are surface one-hour average O3, NO, and NOx measurement results from all reporting sources for 1995. ASCII data files are available for specific time intervals and the full monitoring period. A measurement station description file is included.\r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
