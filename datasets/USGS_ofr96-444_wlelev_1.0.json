    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data sets that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.\n\nThis data set consists of digitized water-level elevation contours for the\nVamoosa-Ada aquifer in east-central Oklahoma. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is an\nimportant source of water that underlies about 2,320-square miles of parts of\nOsage, Pawnee, Payne, Creek, Lincoln, Okfuskee, and Seminole Counties.\nApproximately 75 percent of the water withdrawn from the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is\nfor municipal use. Rural domestic use and water for stock animals account for\nmost of the remaining water withdrawn. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is defined in a\nground-water report as consisting principally of the rocks of the Late\nPennsylvanian-age Vamoosa Formation and overlying Ada Group. The Vamoosa-Ada\naquifer consists of a complex sequence of fine- to very fine-grained sandstone,\nsiltstone, shale, and conglomerate interbedded with very thin limestones. The\nwater-yielding capabilities of the aquifer are generally controlled by lateral\nand vertical distribution of the sandstone beds and their physical\ncharacteristics. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is unconfined where it outcrops in\nabout an 1,700-square-mile area.\n\nThe water-level elevation contours were digitized from a mylar map, at a scale\nof 1:250,000, used to publish a plate in a ground-water report about the\nVamoosa-Ada aquifer. The water-level elevation contours in this data set extend\nwest of the aquifer outcrop to areas where Vanoss Group rocks overlie the Ada\nGroup. The data set also includes a water-level elevation contour for a terrace\ndeposit east of the aquifer outcrop near the North Canadian River. Water-level\nelevations range from 800 to 1,000 feet above sea level for the Vamoosa-Ada\naquifer.",
