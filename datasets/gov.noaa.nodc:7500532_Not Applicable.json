    "description": "Chemical, physical, and other data were collected from CTD casts from the YAQUINA from 20 June 1972 to 24 August 1973. Data were collected by the University of Washington (UW) as part of the International Decade of Ocean Exploration / Coastal Upwelling Ecosystems Analysis (IDOE/CUEA) from 08 July 1977 to 29 July 1977. Data were processed by NODC to the NODC standard F022 High-Resolution CTD/STD Output Format. Full format description is available from NODC at www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-Archive/f022.html.\n\nThe F022 format contains high-resolution data collected using CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) and STD (salinity-temperature-depth) instruments. As they are lowered and raised in the oceans, these electronic devices provide nearly continuous profiles of temperature, salinity, and other parameters. Data values may be subject to averaging or filtering or obtained by interpolation and may be reported at depth intervals as fine as 1m. Cruise and instrument information, position, date, time and sampling interval are reported for each station. Environmental data at the time of the cast (meteorological and sea surface conditions) may also be reported. The data record comprises values of temperature, salinity or conductivity, density (computed sigma-t), and possibly dissolved oxygen or transmissivity at specified depth or pressure levels. Data may be reported at either equally or unequally spaced depth or pressure intervals. A text record is available for comments.",
