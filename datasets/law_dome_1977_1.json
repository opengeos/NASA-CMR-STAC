    "description": "In 1977 several traverses were carried out over the Law Dome area, primarily to drill new ice cores on the dome. The 1974 drill site (near Cape Folger) was redrilled to add instrumentation for inclination, while additional holes at BHQ (418m) and the dome summit (475m, 2x 30m) were also drilled.\n\nIn addition to the drilling work, two strain grids were laid out on the ice surface, and the grid laid out in 1974 was remeasured.\n\nNotes on the traverse and drilling (but few results) are contained in this record, along with the results of the strain grid surveys. Records for this work have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division. \n\nLogbook(s): \nGlaciology Log of 1977 Field Work",
