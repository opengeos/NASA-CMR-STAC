    "description": "The WorldView-4 Multispectral 4-Band Imagery collection contains satellite imagery acquired from Maxar Technologies (formerly known as DigitalGlobe) by the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program. Imagery was collected by the DigitalGlobe WorldView-4 satellite using the SpaceView-110 camera across the global land surface from December 2016 to January 2019. This satellite imagery is in the visible and near-infrared waveband range with data in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared wavelengths. The multispectral imagery has a spatial resolution of 1.24m at nadir and has a temporal resolution of approximately 1.1 days. The data are provided in National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) and GeoTIFF formats. This level 1B data is sensor corrected and is an un-projected (raw) product. The data potentially serve a wide variety of applications that require high resolution imagery. Data access is restricted based on a Maxar End User License Agreement for Worldview 4 imagery and investigators must be approved by the CSDA Program.",
