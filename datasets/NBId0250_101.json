    "description": "The Southern, Northeastern and Eastern Africa members make up the\nAfrica Integrated Terrain Units data set of the UNEP/FAO/ESRI Database\nproject that covers the entire world.  The maps were prepared by\nEnvironmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), USA.  Most data for\nthe database were provided by the Soil Resources, Management and\nConservation Service Land and Water Development Division, Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO), Italy.  The database was developed by\nthe GRID Network of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) as\npart of a project initiated by UNEP.\n\nThe base maps that were used were the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World\n(1977) in Miller Oblated Stereographic projection, the DMA Global\nNavigation and Planning Charts (various Dates between 1976-1982) and\nthe National Geographic Atlas of the World (1975), Physiographic\nDiagram of Africa (the base for the physiographic division), Landsat\nMosaics, USSCS World Soil Map of Africa, Landform map of North Africa,\nUNESCO Geological World Atlas, World Atlas of Agriculture. The high\ndensity polygon features were laser scanned at a resolution of 0.025\ninches. The maps were then transformed from inch coordinates to\nlatitude/longitude degrees. The transformation was done by an\nunpublished algorithm by US Geological Survey and ESRI to create\ncoverages for one-degree graticules.\n\nThis data forms the core of the Desertification study that was the\nfinal goal of the Data compilation in the UNEP/FAO/ESRI project. It\nshows all kinds of land features like general landuse, physiographic\ndivision, general vegetation etc.  The order of integration is FAO\nsoils, geology, USDA soils, landforms and surface modifiers, land\nsurface forms, vegetation, landuse, physiographic divisions,\ngeomorphological regions.  The country boundaries were appended from\nthe Administrative Unit map.",
