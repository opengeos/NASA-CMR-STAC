    "description": "This data set was used to compare base-flow and ground-water nitrate loads to\nassess the significance of ground-water discharge as a source of nitrate load\nto non tidal streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n\nGeneralized lithology (rock type) and physiography based on geologic formations\nwere used to characterize hydrgeomorphic regions (HGMR) within the Chesapeake\nBay watershed. These HGMRs were used in conjunction with existing data to\nassess the significance of ground-water discharge as a source of nitrate load\nto non tidal streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (Bachman and others,\n1998). This work is part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Chesapeake Bay\ninitiative to develop an understanding and provide scientific information for\nthe restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed (Phillips and Caughron,\n1997).\n\nAny use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and\ndoes not imply endorsement by the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nAlthough this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata file is\nintended to document the data set in non proprietary form, as well as in\nARC/INFO format, this metadata file may include some ARC/INFO-specific\nterminology. \n\nThe HGMR data set is the result of combining digital data sets of physiography\nand rock type from numerous sources.",
