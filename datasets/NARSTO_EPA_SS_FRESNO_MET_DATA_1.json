    "description": "NARSTO_EPA_SS_FRESNO_MET_DATA is North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Supersite (SS) Fresno, Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAM) Meteorological Data. This data set contains measurements taken from six meteorological instruments operated at the Fresno supersite from May 24, 2000 to December 31, 2006. The ambient temperature was measured by a Met One Instruments aspirated thermistor, Model 060A-2. The barometric pressure was measured by a Met One pressure transducer, Model 090D. The relative humidity was measured by a Met One aspirated thin film capacitor, Model 083V. The solar radiation was measured by a LI-COR Inc. pyranometer, Model LI-200SA. The wind speed was measured by a Met One Instruments 3-cup anemometer, Model 010-SC. The wind direction was measured by a Met One Instruments High-Sensitivity wind vane, Model 025-5C. All six instruments reported 5 minute samples.\r\n\r\nThe Fresno Supersite is one of several Supersites established in urban areas within the United States by the EPA to better understand the measurement, sources, and health effects of suspended particulate matter (PM). The site is located at 3425 First Street, approximately 1 km north of the downtown commercial district. First Street was a four-lane artery with moderate traffic levels. Commercial establishments, office buildings, churches, and schools were located north and south of the monitor. Medium-density single-family homes and some apartments were located in the blocks to the east and west of First Street. The Fresno Supersite began operation in May of 1999.The EPA PM Supersites Program was an ambient air monitoring research program designed to provide information of value to the atmospheric sciences, and human health and exposure research communities. \r\n\r\nEight geographically diverse projects were chosen to specifically address the following EPA research priorities: (1) to characterize PM, its constituents, precursors, co-pollutants, atmospheric transport, and its source categories that affect the PM in any region; (2) to address the research questions and scientific uncertainties about PM source-receptor and exposure-health effects relationships; and (3) to compare and evaluate different methods of characterizing PM including testing new and emerging measurement methods.\r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
