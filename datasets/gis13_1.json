    "description": "This dataset includes features related to helicopter and fixed wing operations of the Australian Antarctic Division. The features include approach and departure paths, helicopter landing sites, exclusion zones, Wilkins runway, fixed wing skiways, areas occupied by bird colonies and vegetation.\nThe data are for local areas within Australia'a Antarctic Territory.\n\nThis dataset originally consisted of data provided by the Australian Antarctic Division's Helicopter Guidelines Discussion Group. This data was used with other data in the production of the Australian Antarctic Division's series of maps for helicopter operations. Since then additional data has been added and maps for fixed wing operations have also been produced.\n\nThis dataset does not include the helipads at the Australia's year-round stations. They are included in the datasets described by the metadata records 'Casey Station GIS Dataset', 'Davis Station GIS Dataset', 'Macquarie Island Station GIS Dataset' and 'Mawson Station GIS Dataset'.\n\nThe data are available for download from a Related URL below. Files containing the features listed above can be found in the following file groups: Casey Station, Davis Station, Gaussberg, Heard and McDonald Islands, Holme Bay and Framnes Mountains, Larsemann Hills, Macquarie Island, Macquarie Island Station, Mawson Station, Rauer Group, Scullin and Murray Monoliths, Taylor Rookery, Vestfold Hills, Windmill Islands.\n\nThe data conform to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See a Related URL below.\nData described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 13.\nEach feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets and quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature.",
