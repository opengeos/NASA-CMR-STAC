    "description": "Metadata notes for RiSCC Heard Island 2003_04 season (ASAC 1015) - DGPS data and Base Station data DGPS data are described below, and associated data files listed.\n\n1. Three Island study - Phenology and Morphology of Heard Island vascular plants.  This study uses a combination of latitudinal and altitudinal investigations to separate the effects of temperature per se and seasonality on the phenology and morphology of plants.  Most latitudinal studies are confounded by covariation of seasonality and temperature, whereas with altitudinal variation at different latitudes one can disentangle these effects.  The presence of the Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ), which has a major effect on seasonality, would be a key feature that would enable us to investigate this.  Three islands (Marion, Kerguelen, Heard) were used in the study, each of which lies in a different place relative to the APFZ and each of which is inhabited by a similar suite of species, thus removing confounding effects of species identity in understanding responses.\n\n1a Phenology data\nThe collection of positional data for Heard Island Scarlet Hill Phenology was collected at each site; 4 m, 50 m, 100 m, 200 m and 250 m (ASAC 1015). At each site plants of Pringlea antiscorbutica, Acaena magellanica, Poa cookii and Azorella selago were chosen (NB at 100m and 200 m no Acaena magellanica was present, and at 250 m only Pringlea antiscorbutica was sampled) within a 50 x 50 m area, where possible, and were deemed typical of the site. Only healthy mature plants at each site were chosen. At the 4 m, 100 m and 200 m altitude levels, sites were established around AWSs (Automatic Weather Stations). Each plant was flagged and numbered. Numbered flags were removed from around/beside plants at the end of the study. The numbers of plants are represented in the GPS data. Positional data are in the form of points, lines and areas. The positional data are found in the following files.\n\n4 m phenology\nPT021412A.SSF4 m phenology data, N15 Poa cookii data, Poa annua record, 50 m phenology data JDS011811A.SSFcoastal study area, AWS site and phenology site\n\n50 m phenology\nJDS012314A.SSF50 m phenology (Scarlet Hill) and Stephenson camp location\nPT020910A.SSF50 m Azorella phenology, water meadow and Poa cookii N15 sites\n\n100 m phenology\nJDS020714A.SSF200 m Phenology and 100 m AWS and phenology data\nJDS021313A.SSF100 m Phenology (Pringlea)\nPT021614A.SSF250 m and 200 m phenology data, 100m phenology\n\n200 m phenology\nJDS020712A.SSF200 m Phenology site and AWS\nJDS020714A.SSF200 m Phenology and 100 m AWS and phenology data\nPT021614A.SSF250 m and 200 m phenology data, 100m phenology\n\n250 m phenology\nPT021614A.SSF250 m and 200 m phenology data, 100m phenology\n\n1b Morphology data\nDGPS points were only taken by JDS from Fairchild Beach morphology collection sites.\n\nJDS0104.SSFAcaena magellanica, Fairchild Beach morphology JDS010511ATR3.SSFFairchild Beach morphology\n\n2. Positional data for the mapping of the distribution of Ranunculus crassipes The distribution of Ranunculus crassipes at Heard Island was mapped between the 14-1-2004 and 15-2-2004. This mapping was undertaken by JDS, PT and JJS. Data were collected from the Skua Beach bluffs to Sooty Valley. Positional data are in the form of points, lines and areas. Data include areas of rock water meadow. The positional data are found in the following files.\n\nPTRAN021513A.SSFRanunculus crassipes transect, points and rock water meadow JDS020816A.SSFRanunculus crassipes mapping on Skua bluffs JJS011417B.SSFRanunculus crassipes mapping on Skua bluffs\nPT020910A.SSF50 m Azorella phenology, water meadow and Poa cookii N15 sites\n\nThis mapping of the distribution of Ranunculus crassipes together with mapping of Carex trifida and Poa litorosa on Macquarie Island described by the metadata record with ID ASAC_1015_MIGPS03 contributed to the paper:\nBergstrom, D.M., Turner, P.A.M., Scott, J., Copson, G. and Shaw, J.

High altitude vascular plant points and transect data Records of high altitude plants were taken by JDS and RC.
