    "description": "Dimethylsulfide and its precursors and derivatives constitute a major sulfate aerosol source.  This dataset incorporates the potential for increased UV radiation effects due to stratospheric ozone depletion over spring and summer in Antarctica, using large-scale incubation systems and 13-14 day incubation periods.  Surface seawater (200 micron filtered) from the Davis coastal embayment was incubated during four experiments over the 2002-03 Antarctic Summer.\n\nThe data incorporates seawater measurements of DMS, DMSP and DMSO over a temporal progression during each incubation experiment.  Six polyethylene tanks of varying PAR and UV irradiances were incubated. Water was collected stored and analysed by gas chromatography according to a specific sampling protocol, employed by all investigators associated with the project. \n\nThe data are organised according to analysis day, with each days calibration data displayed at the top of each sheet.  The sample code is followed by GC run number and then the raw count data from the GC.  This is calculated to nanomoles DMS, DMSP or DMSO.\n\nSample Codes: Codes for temporal data follow format X.XXXX\n1st X gives experiment number, 1 to 4.\n2nd X gives sampling day, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 (will result in digit code for day no. less than 10\n3rd X gives tank number relating to irradiance level(one to six)\n4th and 5th X is replicate number, (01, 02, 03, DMS), (04, 05,06, DMSP total), (07, 08, 09, DMSP dissolved), (10, 11, 12, DMSO total).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nSample Code\nRun Number from the GC\nCounts - GC generated raw data\nLog Counts - logarithmic conversion of the count data\nLog -c - logarithmic conversion minus the y-intercept determined by calibration of the GC.\n(log -c)/m - log -c divided by m, determined by calibration of the GC.\nngS anti log - nanograms of Sulfur\nNaOH - NaOH adjustment\nngS/L - adjustment per litre\nnM-DMSP/L - nanoMol's DMSP per litre\nnm-DMS/L - nanoMol's DMS per litre\n\nSeptember 2013 Update: DMSO was analysed in these experiments according to an adaptation of the sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduction method of Andreae (1980). The method has since been superseded and the data here probably displays inaccuracies as a result of the analytical method used. This DMSO data should be treated with caution.",
