    "description": "CER_ISCCP-D2like-Nit_Terra-FM1-MODIS_Edition3A is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Cloud Retrievals in International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) Day 2 like Format Nighttime Terra Flight Model 1 (FM1) Edition 3A data product, which was collected using the CERES-FM1 and MODIS instruments on the Terra platform. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe Monthly Gridded Cloud Averages (ISCCP-D2like-Day) data product contains monthly and monthly 3-hourly (GMT-based) gridded regional mean CERES MODIS-derived cloud properties as a function of 18 cloud types, similar to the ISCCP D2 product, where the cloud properties are stratified by pressure, optical depth, and phase. There are separate daytime and nighttime data sets for both Terra-MODIS and Aqua-MODIS. The retrievals, and therefore the quality, are different for each data set. The CERES MODIS-derived cloud properties are not the official NASA MODIS cloud retrievals but are based on the CERES cloud working group retrievals, also available in other CERES products. The CERES MODIS-derived cloud properties have coverage from pole to pole. For these MODIS-based ISCCP-D2like products, the cloud fractions for 42 cloud types, similar to the ISCCP D1 product, are also available. The Single Scanner Footprint TOA/Surface Fluxes and Clouds (SSF) data product is the input to this product. Each ISCCP-D2like file covers a single month.\r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions follow the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, the protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
