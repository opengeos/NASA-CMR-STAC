    "description": "A terrestrial soil sample was collected from King George Island, Antarctica (62\u00b012.37\u2019S, 58\u00b0 47.40\u2019W) on February 12, 2011. The terrestrial soil sample was preserved at -80\uf0b0C until the use. For cultivation, a serially diluted aliquot (100 \u00b5l) of the sample in 0.85% NaCl (w/v) was spread on R2A (BD Difco) plates and incubated at 15\uf0b0C for 11 days. Pure cultures of the bacterial isolates obtained were deposited to Polar and Alpine Microbial Collection (PAMC, Lee et al., 2012) and preserved as glycerol suspensions (20% in distilled water, v/v) at -80 \uf0b0C. In this study, one of these strains, PAMC 27389T, was routinely cultured on 0.5 % TYS at 15\uf0b0C after the determination of optimal temperature for growth. For comparing with strain PAMC 27389T, four type strains of Pseudorhodobacter species, P. wandonensis KCTC 23672T, P. antarcticus KCTC 23700T, P. aquimaris KCTC 23043T, and P. ferrugineus LMG 22047T were purchased from Korean Collection of Type Cultures (KCTC) and Laboratory of Microbiology Gent Bacteria Collection (LMG) and used as reference strains following cultivation under comparable conditions as PAMC 27389T.\r\n\r\nGenome relatedness was investigated by whole genome sequencing of strain PAMC 27389T and four type strains of species of genus Pseudorhodobacter, P. wandonensis KCTC 23672T, P. antarcticus KCTC 23700T, P. ferrugineus LMG 22047T, and P. aquimaris KCTC 23043T.\n-Analysis of Bacterial Community in King George Island, Antarctica.\r\n-Basic data acquisition of PAMC(Polar and Alpine Microbial Collection).\r\n-Academic report of novel strain.",
