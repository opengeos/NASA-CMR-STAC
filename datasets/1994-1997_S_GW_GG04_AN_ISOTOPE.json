    "description": "Ice-cores of the Collins Ice Cap were all gained through the BZXJ-model\n      ice-core drilling machine newly made by Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and\n      Geocryology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. During drilling and collecting\n      ice-cores, strict protection measures against the pollution and melt were taken\n      so that the sample as good as possible to satisfy the demands of physical and\n      chemical analyses of ice-cores. Collected ice-cores were transported under\n      frozen conditions from Antarctica to the low temperature laboratory of Polar\n      Research Institute of China, partly to University of New Hampshire, USA, and\n      were preserved under -25 degrees centigrade. Ice-cores were taken out before\n      analyses, cut apart with a band saw on clean low-temperature working table. We\n      scraped a few millimetres of surface ice to melt under normal air temperature.\n      Oxygen isotope analyses of 0-13.96m depth ice-cores from Big Dome Summit of\n      Collins Ice Cap were completed by the Glacier Research Group, Institute for the\n      Study of Earth, Ocean and Space, University of New Hampshire, USA.  Their\n      sampling interval is 15-20cm, total is 87 samples. Oxygen isotope analyses of\n      13.96-20.02m depth and 27.78-30.52m depth ice-cores from Big Dome Summit of\n      Collins Ice Cap and firn samples drawn from BDA, BDB, BDC and Small Dome Top\n      (SDT) were completed in state key laboratory of mineralization in Nanjing\n      University. Sampling interval (total of 10 samples) is between 30cm and 130cm,\n      and the sampling interval of SDT (total of 20 samples) is 10-20cm.",
