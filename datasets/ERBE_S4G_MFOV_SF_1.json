    "description": "ERBE_S4G_MFOV_SF_1 is the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) S-4G Non-scanner, Medium Field of View (MFOV) Shape Factor (SF) 10 degree Regional Averages in HDF data product. Data collection for this product is complete. This data set consists of non-scanner, medium field-of-view data, which was processed using the shape factor data reduction technique and averaged to a 10.0 degree grid scale. Monthly (day), monthly (hour), daily, and monthly hourly averages were determined for each region. The data are represented as 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integers.\r\n\r\nEarth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) was a multi-satellite system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget. ERBE instruments flew on a mid-inclination National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, NOAA-9 and NOAA-10. NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 provided global coverage and the ERBS provided coverage between 67.5 degrees north and south latitude. Each satellite carried both a scanner and a non-scanner instrument package. The non-scanner instrument contained four Earth-viewing channels and a solar monitor. The Earth-viewing channels had two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth, and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter. The former was called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium field of view (MFOV) channels. For each of the two fields of view, there was a total spectral channel which is sensitive to all wavelengths and a shortwave channel which used a high purity, fused silica filter dome to transmit only the shortwave radiation from 0.2 to 5 microns. Because of the concern for spectral flatness and high accuracy, all five channels on the non-scanner package were active cavity radiometers. The ERBE S-4G product contained averages of radiant flux and albedo on regional, zonal, and global scales. The data for the S-4G product were arranged by parameter values. The ERBE S-4G WFOV product was available as a combination of all operational spacecraft. Products have been archived from November 1984 - January 1985 and June 1989 - February 1990 for ERBS; February 1985 - October 1986 for ERBS/NOAA-9; November 1986 - January 1987 for ERBS/NOAA-9/NOAA-10; and February 1987 - May 1989 for ERBS/NOAA-10. The various combinations of the satellites reflected the actual duration of the scanners.",
