    "description": "This NCEI Accession contains the compiled data product of profile, discrete biogeochemical measurements from 35 individual cruise data sets collected from a variety of ships in the southern Salish Sea and northern California Current System (Washington state marine waters) from 2008-02-04 to 2018-10-19. Water-column time-series stations were occupied in the Salish Sea and adjoining northern California Current System coastal waters in Washington State. Each cruise was designed to obtain a synoptic or targeted snapshot of key carbon, physical, and other biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in Washington's estuarine and/or coastal environments. Two predominant subsets of sampling stations were occupied: 1) Puget Sound stations, wherein all basins within the sound and across the sill at its inlet are sampled, and have recurred regularly in April, July, and September since 2014; and 2) \"Sound-to-Sea\" cruises, associated with servicing the \u00c4\u0086h\u00c3\u00a1\u00ca\u0094ba\u00c2\u00b7 ocean acidification mooring off La Push, Washington, and including sampling at a suite of CTD stations located between Seattle and the mooring site off the coast, occurring most frequently in May and October. At all sampling stations, CTD casts were conducted to measure temperature, conductivity, pressure, and oxygen concentrations using CTD and oxygen sensors. Discrete water samples were collected throughout the water column at all stations in Niskin bottles. Laboratory analyses were run to measure dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), oxygen, and nutrient concentrations and total alkalinity. More information, including a map of stations occupied during each cruise (and other Salish cruises), full-resolution CTD downcast data for all stations sampled, chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations, and other sensor data, can be found at nvs.nanoos.org/CruiseSalish by exploring the Map, Data, and Plots tabs. Maps of stations sampled during each cruise, along with the full discrete sample data set for each cruise, can be found by exploring the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information landing page at https://www.nodc.noa.gov/ocads/oceans/SalishCruises_2008_2018.html for this compiled data product and pages linked therein. This effort was conducted in support of the estuarine and coastal monitoring and research objectives of the University of Washington Puget Sound Regional Synthesis Model (PRISM), the Washington Ocean Acidification Center (WOAC), the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory's Carbon Group, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Acidification Program and conforms to climate-quality monitoring guidelines of the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (goa-on.org). For any questions about appropriate use or limitations of the data set, please contact Drs. Simone Alin and Jan Newton at email addresses above.",
