    "description": "The survey was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219) during 2001/02 summer at Casey.  GPS data were collected for all snow petrel nests and wilson's storm petrel nests located during intensive searches of ice-free areas in the Windmill Islands. Approximately 20% of the ice-free areas were surveyed in this manner.\n\nPublic summary for project 1219:\n\nThis project provides population data on Antarctic and Subantarctic seabirds that permit assessments to be made of natural population trends at local to regional scales, so that changes in populations due to to human disturbance, such as station activities and helicopter operations can be identified.\n\nThe data file includes two shapefiles, one with snow petrel nest sites and the other with wilson storm petrel nest sites.\n\nThe metadata records linked at the provided URLs describe the collection of locations of snow petrel nests at Casey in 1998/99 and 1999/2000.",
