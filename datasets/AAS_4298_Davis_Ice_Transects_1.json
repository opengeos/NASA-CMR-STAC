    "description": "In situ measurements of ice and snow thickness, and freeboard along an irregular transect on the fast, complementing the repeat ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) transects. During our deployment at Davis in 2015 logistics and environmental conditions permitted measurements along 4 transects. The location of the reference grid (ROV box) had its origin (x=0, y=0) at (-68.568904 degrees N,+77.945439 degrees E). Transects 1 \u2013 4 started at x=60, x=70, x=80 and x=90 m and were sampled at y-positions of 0m, 0.5m, 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m, 16m, 32m, 64m, 128m, (256m, and 512m), respectively. Depending on working conditions the overall transect lengths varied from 128 \u2013 512 m.\n\nSampling dates for in situ ice physcis: \nTransect ID\tDate of sampling\tZice and FB measured at\tIce core taken at\tSnowpit measured at\nT1\t19/11/2015\t0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, \u2026 64m.\t0m, 128m, 512m\t0m, 128m, 512m\nT2\t23/11/2015\t0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, \u2026 64m.\t0m, 128m, 512m\t0m, 128m\nT3\t29/11/2015\t0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, \u2026 64m.\t0m, 128m\t0m, 128m\nT4\t02/12/2015\t0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, \u2026 64m.\t0m, 128m\t0m, 128m\n\nIce cores and snow pits were collected at the 0m, 50m and 100m mark along the transect, where possible. Additionally, ice cores for density analysis were taken at a few of the ice-core sites for independent verification of ice density.",
