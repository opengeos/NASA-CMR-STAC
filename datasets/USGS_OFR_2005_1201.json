    "description": "Water-use data were compiled for the 78 municipios of the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico for 2000. Five offstream categories were considered: public-supply\nwater withdrawals, domestic self-supplied water use, industrial self-supplied\nwithdrawals, crop irrigation water use, and thermoelectric power fresh water\nuse. Two additional categories also were considered: power generation instream\nuse and public wastewater treatment return-flows. Fresh water withdrawals for\noffstream use from surface- and ground-water sources in Puerto Rico were\nestimated at 617 million gallons per day. The largest amount of fresh water\nwithdrawn was by public-supply water facilities and was estimated at 540\nmillion gallons per day. Fresh surface- and ground-water withdrawals by\ndomestic self-supplied users was estimated at 2 million gallons per day and the\nindustrial self-supplied withdrawals were estimated at 9.5 million gallons per\nday. Withdrawals for crop irrigation purposes were estimated at 64 million\ngallons per day, or approximately 10 percent of all offstream fresh water\nwithdrawals. Saline instream surface-water withdrawals for cooling purposes by\nthermoelectric power facilities was estimated at 2,191 million gallons per day,\nand instream fresh water withdrawals by hydroelectric facilities at 171 million\ngallons per day. Total discharge from public wastewater treatment facilities\nwas estimated at 211 million gallons per day.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
