    "description": "A report and images taken as part of ASAC (AAS) project 380 - Archaeological Investigation of Sealing Sites at Heard Island.\n\nTaken from the report:\n\nFrom November 1986 to January 1987 the authors participated in the ANARE expedition to Heard Island.  Our objectives were:\n\n1) To undertake a survey of historic archaeological sites of Heard Island and to compile an inventory of sites.\n\n2) At the request of the Antarctic Division to salvage certain sealing-era artefacts identified in the 1985/86 ANARE report as being at risk.\n\n3) At the request of the Antarctic Division, to record the site of the historic ANARE station at Atlas Cove, to assess the significance of surviving site features and make recommendations for the conservation of significant elements.\n\n4) To provide a report to the Australian Heritage Commission documenting the location, description and assessment of the various sealing and other historic places located during the 1986-87 expedition.\n\nSealing sites on Heard Island can be categorised into five types based on structural and functional differences.  These five types are:\n\na) stone platforms\nb) hut footings or ruins\nc) occupied caves\nd) barrels\ne) grave\n\nAll types of sites are found on the various beaches around the island, except that stone platforms appear to be confined to the southern beaches, and only one grave is known.",
