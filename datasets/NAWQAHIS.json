    "description": "The retrospective database is a compilation of historical water-quality and\nancillary data collected before NAWQA Study Units initiated sampling in 1993.\nThis coverage contains the point locations of monitoring locations where\nhistorical water-quality data was collected. Water-quality data were obtained\nby study-unit personnel from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water\nInformation System (NWIS), from records of State water-resource agencies, and\nfrom STORET, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency national database.\nAncillary data describing characteristics of sampled sites were compiled by\nNAWQA Study Units or obtained from national-scale digital maps.\n\nMueller and others (1995) used this data to determine preexisting water-quality\nconditions in the first 20 NAWQA Study Units that began in 1991. Also, Nolan\nand Ruddy (1996) used the data to describe areas of the United States at risk\nof nitrate contamination of ground water.\n\nSupplemental_Information:\n\nThe retrospective database includes over 22,000 surface-water samples. The\nsurface-water data are for samples collected during 1980-90 at sites that had a\nminimum of 25 monthly samples. Year of sampling is included in the\nretrospective database because it was reported most often by the various Study\nUnits. Year of sampling also is convenient because some Study Units reported\nmedian constituent concentrations. If sampling date ranges for median values\nfell within a single year, then year of sampling was retained in the national\ndata set for that sample.\n\nBecause sampling, preservation, and analytical techniques associated with these\nhistorical data changed during the period of record and are different for\ndifferent agencies, reported nutrient concentrations were aggregated into the\nfollowing groups: (1) ammonia as N, (2) nitrate as N, (3) total nitrogen, (4)\northophosphate as P, and (5) total phosphorus. For example, ammonia includes\nboth ammonium ions and un-ionized ammonia. More information on methods used to\naggregate constituent data is available in the report by Mueller and others\n(1995).\n\nMuch of the ancillary data, such as well and aquifer descriptions and  land-use\nclassification for surface-water drainage basins, were provided by NAWQA Study\nUnits. Data evaluated at the national scale include land use, soil hydrologic\ngroup, nitrogen input to the land surface, and the ratios of pasture or\nwoodland to cropland.\n\nLand-use classification of surface-water sites is based on Anderson Level I\ncategories (Anderson and others, 1976). Land use at surface-water sites was\nclassified by NAWQA Study Unit personnel based on the Anderson Level I\ncategories. Many surface-water sites were affected by mixed land uses, such as\nForest and Agricultural, or Agricultural and Urban. Surface-water sites with\nvery large drainage areas (greater than 10,000 square miles) were considered to\nbe affected by multiple land uses, and were designated as Integrated land use.\nMore detailed descriptions of the land-use categories in the retrospective\ndatabase are given by Mueller and others (1995).\n\nSoil hydrologic group was determined from digital maps compiled by the U.S.\nSoil Conservation Service (1993). The categorical values (A, B, C, and D) from\nthe digital maps were converted to numbers to permit aggregation (Mueller and\nothers, 1995). Surface-water sites were assigned the area-weighted mean for\nsoil mapping units in the upstream drainage basin. Many surface-water sites did\nnot have digitized basin boundaries available, so hydrologic group could not be\nevaluated.\n\nFertilizer and manure applications were estimated from national databases of\nfertilizer sales (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1990) and animal\npopulations (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1989). Nitrogen input by atmospheric\ndeposition was derived from data provided by the National Atmospheric\nDeposition Program/National Trends Network (1992).\n\nPopulation data were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1991). Total\npopulation in the upstream drainage was compiled for the surface-water data\nset.\n\nWithin the database, concentrations less than detection are reported as\nnegative values of the detection limit. Missing values are indicated by a\ndecimal point. (During processing of the tabular data, these decimal points\nwere replaced will NULL values; See Data_Quality_Information section.\n\nHistorical data can be of limited use in national assessments because of\ninconsistencies between and within agencies in database structure and format\nand in sample collection, preservation, and analytical procedures. For example,\nchanges in sample collection and analytical procedures can cause shifts in\nconstituent concentrations that are unrelated to possible changes in\nenvironmental factors. See Mueller and others (1995) for assumptions and\nlimitations associated with the retrospective database. \n\n[Summary provided by the EPA.]",
