    "description": "INPE's only receiving station for SPOT HRV is located in Cuiaba, MT\n            (geographic coordinates approx. 15.5S/56.0W). Data have been acquired\n            based on requests from users and over priority areas, therefore the\n            coverage is not continuous. Most of the data lies within Brazil.\n            \n            The HRV tapes recorded at Cuiaba are air shipped to the processing and\n            distribution center in Cachoeira Paulista, SP, where they are\n            kept. The holdings are estimated to be around 11,000 scenes (about\n            8600 XS and 2300 PAN). About 500 scenes have been processed to\n            black-and-white film originals, and half of this number composited\n            into color negatives. No copies are kept of produced CCTs.\n            \n            Requests for products and for image search listings *originated in\n            South American countries* are handled by INTERSAT, the SPOT Image\n            representative in Brazil (Al. Jose Alves Siqueira F., 139 / 12245-260\n            Sao Jose dos Campos, SP / Brazil / phone +55.12.321-8966; fax\n            +55.12.322-2076; e-mail intersat@iconet.com.br). No online remote\n            access is available to the moment, although plans exist to implement\n            it, including the International Directory protocols. No firm date is\n            speculated for that, but hopes are that it can be made before\n            1998. Information about costs, delivery time and available formats can\n            be requested at the same address.\n            \n            Requests from other countries must be routed through SPOT Image in\n            Toulouse, France (16 bis, avenue Edouard Belin / 31030 Toulouse Cedex\n            / Fax +33.61.27.46.05 / Phone +33.61.53.99.76).",
