    "description": "The objectives of this data acquisition project were to complete the downhole geophysical logging including video and flowmeter logging of two core holes (9A and 11A), which are the deepest wells at monitor well sites 0009AB and 0011AB.\n      \n      The goal of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCWP) is to rehydrate wetlands and reduce point-source discharge to Biscayne Bay. The BBCWP will replace lost overland flow and partially compensate for the reduction in ground-water seepage by redistributing, through a spreader system, available surface water entering the area from regional canals. The proposed redistribution of freshwater flow across a broad front is expected to restore or enhance freshwater wetlands, tidal wetlands, and near shore bay habitat. A critical component of the BBCWP is the development of a realistic representation of ground-water flow within the karst Biscayne aquifer. Mapping these ground-water flow units is key to the development of models that simulate ground-water flow from the Everglades and urban areas through the coastal wetlands to Biscayne Bay. Because there is little detailed hydrogeologic data of the Surficial aquifer (to depth) in this area, the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project Delivery Team installed two monitor-well sites and collected the necessary detailed hydrogeologic data. The L-31 North Canal Seepage Management Pilot Project is intended to curtail easterly seepage emanating from within Everglades National Park (ENP). The pilot project is examining various seepage management technologies as well as operational changes that could be implemented to reduce the water losses from ENP. This project is in close proximity to Biscayne Bay so an effort has been made to combine ongoing work efforts at the two project areas. The distribution of seepage into the L-31 North Canal and beneath it is not known with any degree of certainty today. A canal draw down experiment was conducted to provide additional field data that will be utilized to refine seepage estimates in the study area as well as determine aquifer parameters in the study area.\n      \n      This project was funded by the USGS Florida Integrated Science Center and  the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD).",
