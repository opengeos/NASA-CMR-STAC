    "description": "John van den Hoff (Australian Antarctic Division biologist) visited the Frazier Islands on 12 and 13 December 2011. He was assisted by Tim Gill (Field Training Officer), Dan Blight and Trevor Crews (Casey winterers) and Zane Hacker and Oliver Henshaw (watercraft operators). \nVisits were made to Charlton, Dewart and Nelly Islands and four cameras, tripods and supporting solar power packs were deployed on Nelly Island. The main visit occurred on 12 December and a shorter second visit to check on the cameras was made on 13 December 2011. The cameras were installed to monitor the southern giant nesting areas.\nA count was made of the number of southern giant petrels in each nesting area.\n\nA search for bird carcasses was made on Nelly Island with none found or collected.\n\nThis dataset includes the counts, camera locations and GIS polygon data representing the extents of the southern giant petrel nesting areas as observed on this visit.",
