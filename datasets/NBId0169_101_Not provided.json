    "description": "The purpose of the Kenya Pilot Study was to evaluate the FAO/UNEP\nProvisional Methodology for Assessment and Mapping of Desertification,\nand to recommend an effective, simple methodology for desertification\nassessment within Kenya.\n\nThe FAO/UNEP Provisional Methodology (1984) proposes seven processes\nfor consideration in desertification assessment: degradation of\nvegetation, water erosion, wind erosion, salinization, reduction of\norganic content, soil crusting and compaction.\n\nIn late 1985, a pilot project for the assessment of the FAO/UNEP\nMethodology within Kenya was proposed, and in 1987 a memorandum of\nunderstanding between the Government of Kenya and UNEP for the\nimplementation of that study was signed.\n\nThe study areas were:\n1) Models can be useful to assist in desertification assessment.\nModels can be developed from FAO/UNEP Methodology.\n\n2) Any modeling output requires verification.\n\n3) Ground survey and remote sensing can be important sources of data.\n\n4) An evaluation of data and methodologies necessary to allow\nverification of desertification assessment modeling is required.\n\n5) A human use component should be incorporated into desertification\nassessment that considers management implications and social, as well\nas, economic context.\n\n6) Computer implementation of desertificaiton assessment can be\neffective, however, procedures should be well defined.\n\nThis study within the Baringo Study Area was designed to address these\nconcerns.\n\nThe Baringo Study Area identified in this study would be typical of\nsuch a training area.  The models developed during this study could be\napplied to the general region.\n\nThe study area lies between 0 15'-1 N and 35 30' -36 30' E.\n\nIt is located between the Laikipia escarpment to the East and the\nTugen Hills to the West. Topographic elevations vary from 900m on the\nNjemps flats to 2000m in the Puka, Tangulbei and Pokot highlands.  The\nsize of the study area is approximately 15ookm2.\n\n\n4.0 DATA COLLECTION\n\nA wide variety of data was collected. Detailed data was required to\nprovide a basis for evaluating more general cost effective data\ngathering techniques and to provide a basis for model verification,\nparticularly the socio/economic data.\n\nPhysical Environment\nTopographic Data\nTopographic contours were digitized directly from 1:250,000 Survey of\nKenya topographic maps.  The contour interval was 200 feet.  A digital\nelevation model was constructed using triangular irregular networks\n(TIN).\n\nSoil Data\nSoil types were mapped at 1:100,000 scale using existing soil maps,\nmanual interpretation of SPOT imagery, and field investigations\n(Figure 3).  During field trips, soil samples were taken from each\nsoil unit and analyzed by the Kenya National Agricultural Center.\n\n4.2 Climate Data\n4.2.1 Rainfall Data\nRainfall data from the Kenya Meteorological Department was analyzed\nfor 33 stations within and surrounding the study area.  A rainfall\nerosivity index was calculated based on the Fourier Index (R).\n12\nRE (p /P)\n12\nwhere P = annual rainfall\np = monthly rainfall\n\nA relationship between this erosivity index and the annual rainfall\nfor each station was calculated using linear regression (Bake, 1988).\nA map of rainfall erosivity was generated for the study area by\nrelating annual rainfall isoheyts to the following:\n\ny = 0.108x - 0.68\n\nThis data was coded and digitized.\n\nWind Erosion Potential\nThe following required conditions were determined to create high wind\nerosion potential (Kinuthia, 1989):\n\n1) Annual rainfall less than 300mm.\n2) P/E greater than zero and less than 1, where:\nP=mean monthly rainfall (cm).\nE=mean monthly PET (cm).\n3) Wind velocity greater than 4 m/s at 10m height.\n\nVegetation Data\nA vegetation map for the study area was produced at a scale of\n1:100,000 through manual interpretation of a SPOT image and field\ninvestigations (Figure 6).  A structural classification system as\nadopted by DRSRS was used for naming vegetation types (Grunb).\n\nSystematic Reconnaissance Flight Data Since 1977, DRSRS has been\nconducting aerial surveys of Kenyan rangelands.  In addition to data\non the number of wildlife and livestock, observations of land use and\nenvironmental condition are also made.\n\nSocio/economic Data\nSocial Factors\n\nA wide variety of data was collected through literature review and a\nfield administered questionnaire.  Nutritional status was estimated by\nmeasurement of childrens' mid upper arm.  Such data is useful for a\nLevel 1 type assessment.\n\nPermanent Structures Data\nFor the Level 2 assessment, data on permanent structures was extracted\nfrom DRSRS SRF data.  This data was used to indicate presence and\nconcentration of sedentary populations.\n\nExample\nFiles: VDS.E00 (Vegetation degradation)\nDES.E00 (Plant Species)\nOthers available on request.",
