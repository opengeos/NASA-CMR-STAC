    "description": "The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is responsible for the archive and distribution of NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/competitive-programs/measures) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which includes the global 1 arc second (~30 meter) combined (merged) image data product. (See User Guide (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf) Section 2.2.2.)\n\nThe combined image data set contains mosaicked one degree by one degree images/tiles of uncalibrated radar brightness values at 1 arc second. To create a smooth mosaic image, each pixel in an output is an average of all the image pixels for a location. Pixels with a value of zero (voids) were not counted. Because SRTM imaged a given location with two like-polarization channels (VV = vertical transmit and vertical receive, and HH = horizontal transmit and horizontal receive) and at a variety of look and azimuth angles, the quantitative scattering information was lost in the pursuit of a smoother image product unlike the SRTM swath image product SRTMIMGR (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMIMGR.003), which preserved the quantitative scattering information.\n\nThe NASA SRTM data sets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. This collaboration aims to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was the primary (and virtually only) payload on the STS-99 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which launched February 11, 2000 and \ufb02ew for 11 days.\n\nThe SRTM swaths extended from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km), creating swaths ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60\u00b0 N and 56\u00b0 S latitude to account for 80% of Earth\u2019s total landmass. \n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions \n* Voids in the Version 3.0 products have been filled with ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 2.0, the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010), and the National Elevation Dataset (NED).",
