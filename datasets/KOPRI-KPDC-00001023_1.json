    "description": "Inflammation mediated by the innate immune system is an organism\u2019s protective mechanism against\r\ninfectious environmental risk factors. It is also a driver of the pathogeneses of various human\r\ndiseases, including cancer development and progression. Microalgae are increasingly being focused\r\non as sources of bioactive molecules with therapeutic potential against various diseases.\r\nFurthermore, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer potentials of microalgae and their\r\nsecondary metabolites have been widely reported. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to\r\nbe elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the\r\nanti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of the ethanol extract of the Antarctic freshwater\r\nmicroalga Micractinium sp. (ETMI) by several in vitro assays using RAW 264.7 macrophages and\r\nHCT116 human colon cancer cells. ETMI exerted its anti-inflammatory activity by modulating the\r\nmain inflammatory indicators such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interleukin (IL)-6, inducible nitric\r\noxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent\r\nmanner. In addition, ETMI exerted cytotoxic activity against HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent\r\nmanner, leading to significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation. Further, it induced cell cycle arrest\r\nin the G1 phase through the regulation of hallmark genes of the G1/S phase transition, including\r\nCDKN1A, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6, respectively). At the transcriptional\r\nlevel, the expression of CDKN1A gradually increased in response to ETMI treatment while that of\r\nCDK4 and CDK6 decreased. Taken together, our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory and\r\nanticancer activities of the Antarctic freshwater microalga, Micractinium sp., and ETMI may provide a\r\nnew clue for understanding the molecular link between inflammation and cancer and that ETMI may\r\nbe a potential anticancer agent for targeted therapy of colorectal cancer.\nThe main purpose of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of the ethanol extract from the polar microalga Micractinium sp. (ETMI) on the human colon cancer cell line, HCT116.",
