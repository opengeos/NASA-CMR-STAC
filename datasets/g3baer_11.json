    "description": "Data quality notice: The SAGE III/ISS team recommends against using data from events 2024030913SS, 2024030915SS, and 2024030917SS. These events were affected by line-of-sight blockage from a docked spacecraft which undermined the data quality. Typically, such events are withheld by a quality assurance process.  \r\n\r\ng3baer_11 is the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) on the International Space Station (ISS) (SAGE III/ISS) Level 2 Monthly Aerosol Product (NetCDF) V011 data product. It contains all of the aerosol data and flags for a month of solar events.  \r\n\r\nLaunched on February 19, 2017 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Kennedy Space Center, the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS), the second instrument from the SAGE III project, is externally mounted on the International Space Station (ISS). This ISS-based instrument uses a technique known as occultation, which involves looking at the light from the Sun or Moon as it passes through Earth\u2019s atmosphere at the edge, or limb, of the planet to provide long-term monitoring of ozone vertical profiles of the stratosphere and mesosphere. The data provided by SAGE III/ISS includes other key components of atmospheric composition and their long-term variability, focusing on the study of aerosols, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen trioxide, and water vapor. SAGE data has historically been used by the World Meteorological Organization to inform their periodic assessments of ozone depletion. These new observations from the International Space Station will continue the SAGE team's contributions to ongoing scientific understanding of the Earth's atmosphere.",
