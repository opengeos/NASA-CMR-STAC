    "description": "The objective of this project is to estimate the rate of nitrogen loss in\nselected reaches of the Connecticut River. In-stream loss of nitrogen may\ninfluence the total nitrogen loads being input to Long Island Sound (LIS);\ntherefore, an improved understanding of nitrogen attenuation is needed to plan\neffective strategies for meeting the goals of the LIS Total Maximum Daily Load\n(TMDL) allocation plan approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(USEPA) in 2001. The TMDL plan was instituted to reduce the problem of chronic\nseasonal hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) that results from excessive nitrogen\nloading in Long Island Sound.\n\nTwo study methods were used to measure nitrogen loss in selected study reaches\nof the Connecticut River during 2005: a mass-balance study to observe in-stream\nchanges in total nitrogen, and a dissolved nitrogen gas study to measure\ndenitrification. For the mass-balance study, samples were collected from all\nmajor tributaries and at the upstream and downstream ends of two 30- to 40-mile\nstudy reaches, and were analyzed for total nitrogen (including ammonia,\nnitrite, nitrate, and organic nitrogen). Streamflow data (from USGS gaging\nstations or manual measurements) were also taken at the time of sampling so\nthat the mass flux of nitrogen could be computed at each site. To assess the\neffects of different hydrologic conditions and water temperatures on nitrogen\nattenuation in the Connecticut River, the study reaches were sampled two times\nin the spring and summer. The calculations of nitrogen mass flux entering and\nexiting each study reach will indicate when and where nitrogen removal\nprocesses are significant.\n\nThe study of dissolved nitrogen gas was performed on a 6-mile sub-reach of the\nConnecticut River during a period of late summer when warm temperatures and\nlow-flow conditions are most conducive to observing measurable rates of\ndenitrification. Denitrification is estimated by measuring the downstream\nchange in dissolved nitrogen after compensating for gas exchange with the\natmosphere and dilution from inflows. Gas exchange is computed from the\ndownstream concentration changes of SF6 gas and Bromide, which are injected at\nthe head of the study reach.\n\nThe data from this study will be useful for verifying predictions of nitrogen\ninputs, transport, and loss from water-quality models such as the New England\nSPARROW model and the RivR-N model. The results will assist state resource\nmanagers in the development of nitrogen reduction strategies for the\nConnecticut River Watershed, including the selection of sources in which to\ntarget these strategies. Results of the study will be presented in a journal\npaper in 2007. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
