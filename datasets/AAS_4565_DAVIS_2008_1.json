    "description": "Area of heavy ground disturbance surrounding Davis Station. Originally GIS-mapped from aerial imagery during 2008 and then ground-truthed during fieldwork at Davis on the 11th December 2008.\n\nFootprint shapefile of heavy ground disturbance for Davis Station.\n\nThis shapefile was created by mapping all areas of visible heavy surface disturbance at Davis Station from aerial imagery during 2008. This area was then ground-truthed and corrected from fieldwork measurements on the 11th December 2008 with support from the Australian Antarctic Program.\n\nMethods and origins from this work is contained within the following article:\nBROOKS, S. T. 2014. Developing a Standardised Approach to Measuring the Environmental Footprint of Antarctic Research Stations. Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy and Management, 16, 1450037.\n\nAny reuse of this data within published work should cite this associated paper.",
