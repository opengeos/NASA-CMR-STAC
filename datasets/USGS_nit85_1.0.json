    "description": "NITROGEN-FERTILIZER SALES DATA Estimates of nitrogen-fertilizer sales by\ncounty were generated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1990) and by\nJerald Fletcher (West Virginia University, written commun., 1992) by using the\nfollowing procedure: (1) compiling annual State fertilizer-sales data reported\nas tonnages to the National Fertilizer and Environmental Research Center of the\nTVA; (2) calculating the ratio of expenditures for commercial fertilizers by\ncounty to expenditures for commercial fertilizers by States from the 1987\nCensus of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989a); and (3) computing\nannual county-level nitrogen-fertilizer sales, in tons, by multiplying\nestimates of annual States sales by the ratio of county expenditures to States\nexpenditures.  In some counties no fertilizer sales were reported, but some\nfertiliz use was reported in the Census Data.  Although fertilizer expenditures\nestimates (in $1,000) represent the 1987 growing year, the nitrogen-fertilizer\nsales estimates (tons) generally reflect 1985 amounts.  Estimates of\nnitrogen-fertilizer sales by county were constructed fro a combination of data\nreported to State regulatory agencies and from data in the 1987 Census of\nAgriculture. Fertilizer-sales data submitted annually to State regulatory\nagencies by fertilizer dealers reflect total sales without regard to the land\nuse for which it was bought, or the State (or county) in which the fertilizer\nwas actually used. In the Census of Agriculture sampling and statistics were\nused to account for non responding farm operations (U.S. Department of\nCommerce, 1989b) Thus, the information that describes county-level fertilizer\nsales is subject to sampling variability as well as reporting and coverage\nerrors. Census disclosure rules also prevent the publication of information\nthat would reveal the operation of individual farms. COUNTY BOUNDARIES The\noriginal files for this map were provided in 15 sections. Boundaries near the\nedges of sections have been adjusted in edgematching.  Polygons that extend\ninto the water (an ocean or the Great Lakes) should be considered arbitrary.\nOriginating_Center: (required) Group: Reference End_Group Group: Summary\n\nThe nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates in this coverage are intended for use\nin estimating regional fertilizer sales, and in producing visual displays and\nmapping relative rates of fertilizer sales across broad regions of the United\nStates.\n\nThis coverage contains estimates of nitrogen-fertilizer sales for the\nconterminous United States in 1985 as reported by the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (1990) and by Jerald Fletcher (West Virginia University,\nwritten commun., 1992). Nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates in this coverage\nare reported for each county polygon in tons of actual nutrient sold (inorganic\nnitrogen, phosphate, and potash) as distinct from total tons of fertilizer\nproduct. \n\nThe data are summarized for fertilizer years (i.e. the 1987 fertilizer year\nruns from July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987).\n\nThe polygons representing county boundaries in the conterminous United States,\nas well as lakes, estuaries, and other nonland-area features were derived from\nthe Digital Line Graph (DLG) file representing the 1:2,000,000-scale map in the\nNational Atlas of the United States (1970).",
