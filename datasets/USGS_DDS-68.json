    "description": "Coastal Changes Due to Sea-Level Rise:\n\nOne of the most important applied problems in coastal geology today is\ndetermining the physical response of the coastline to sea-level rise.\nPredicting shoreline retreat, beach loss, cliff retreat, and land loss rates is\ncritical to planning coastal zone management strategies and assessing\nbiological impacts due to habitat change or destruction. Presently, long-term\n(>50 years) coastal planning and decision-making has been done piecemeal, if at\nall, for the nation's shoreline (National Research Council, 1990; 1995).\nConsequently, facilities are being located and entire communities are being\ndeveloped without adequate consideration of the potential costs of protecting\nor relocating them from sea-level rise related erosion, flooding and storm\ndamage.\n\nRecent estimates of future sea-level rise based on climate modeling (Wigley and\nRaper, 1992) suggest an increase in global eustatic sea-level of between 15 and\n95 cm by 2100, with a \"best estimate\" of 50 cm (IPCC, 1995). This is more than\ndouble the rate of eustatic rise for the past century (Douglas, 1997; Peltier\nand Jiang, 1997).\n\nThe prediction of coastal evolution is not straightforward. There is no\nstandard methodology, and even the kinds of data required to make such\npredictions are the subject of much scientific debate. A number of predictive\napproaches have been used (National Research Council, 1990), including: 1.\nextrapolation of historical data (for example, coastal erosion rates); 2.\nstatic inundation modeling; 3. application of a simple geometric model (for\nexample, the Bruun Rule); 4. application of a sediment dynamics/budget model;\nor 5. Monte Carlo (probabilistic) simulation based on parameterized physical\nforcing variables. Each of these approaches, however, has its shortcomings or\ncan be shown to be invalid for certain applications (National Research Council,\n1990). Similarly, the types of input data required vary widely, and for a given\napproach (for example, sediment budget), existing data may be indeterminate or\nmay simply not exist (Klein and Nicholls, 1999). Furthermore, human\nmanipulation of the coast in the form of beach nourishment, construction of\nseawalls, groins, and jetties, as well as coastal development itself, may\ndictate Federal, State and local priorities for coastal management without\nproper regard for geologic processes. Thus, the long-term decision to renourish\nor otherwise engineer a coastline may be the primary determining factor in how\nthat coastal segment evolves.\n\nVariables Affecting Coastal Vulnerability:\n\nWe use here a fairly simple classification of the relative vulnerability of\ndifferent U.S. coastal environments to future rises in sea-level. This approach\ncombines the coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability\nto adapt to changing environmental conditions, and yields a relative measure of\nthe system's natural vulnerability to the effects of sea-level rise (Klein and\nNicholls, 1999).  The vulnerability classification is based upon the relative\ncontributions and interactions of six variables:\n\n1. Tidal range, which contributes to inundation hazards.\n\n2. Wave height, which is linked to inundation hazards.\n\n3. Coastal slope (steepness or flatness of the coastal region), which is linked\nto the susceptibility of a coast to inundation by flooding and to the rapidity\nof shoreline retreat.\n\n4. Shoreline erosion rates, which indicate how the given section of shoreline\nhas been eroding.\n\n5. Geomorphology, which indicates the relative erodibility of a given section\nof shoreline.\n\n6. Historical rates of relative sea-level rise, which correspond to how the\nglobal (eustatic) sea-level rise and local tectonic processes (land motion such\nas uplift or subsidence) have affected a section of shoreline.\n\nThe input data for this database of coastal vulnerability have been assembled\nusing the original, and sometimes variable, horizontal resolution, which then\nwas resampled to a 3-minute grid cell. A data set for each risk variable is\nthen linked to each grid point. For mapping purposes, data stored in the\n3-minute grid is transferred to a 1:2,000,000 vector shoreline with each\nsegment of shoreline lying within a single grid cell.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
