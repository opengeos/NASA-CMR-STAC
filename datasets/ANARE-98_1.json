    "description": "From the abstract of the referenced publication:\n\nFive possible runway sites have been proposed within 4 km of Davis on the northwestern part of Broad Peninsula, Vestfold Hills.  Most are on on thin, young sedimentary sequences on low level flat areas, although two are dominantly on Precambrian basement, one of which is at low elevation.\n\nThis report reviews the geology of each site as a background summary for use by engineers in the event of a decision to build.\n\nPermafrost level in the area is normally within 100+/- 20-30 cm of the surface and appears to vary depending on location and proximity to water masses.\n\nThe report uses as much information as can be assembled from earlier dispersed reports and adds detailed grain size data from eight sites cored during the 1993-94 summer.\n\nStratigraphy of the sediment sections is not well understood and is best documented in the Heidemann Valley.  Maximum sediment thickness known is about 4 m.  All sediments appear to be younger than one million years and probably are much younger.\n\nSpeculation is given about the origin and significance of some of the features of the area.\n\n\nAvailable for download:\n\n1 The ANARE Research Notes 98 publication as a pdf.\n\n2 AutoCAD drawing file data digitised in November 1996 from original survey plans of the possible runway sites survey undertaken in February 1984 by the Australian Survey Office. \nThe original survey plan drawing number is 3276/001 in 9 sheets.\nThe coordinates system for the drawing file is WGS84 UTM grid Zone 44.\n\n3 Eleven maps of the possible runway sites in Adobe Illustrator (.ai) format.\nThe maps were produced by AUSLIG (Australian Survey and Land Information Group) using the digitised survey data and are included in the publication.\nThe maps are also available from the Antarctic Map Catalogue as pdf.\nThe map catalogue numbers are 13363 to 13373.\nSee a Related URL for a link to the Antarctic Map Catalogue.",
