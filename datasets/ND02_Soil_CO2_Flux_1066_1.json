CO2 flux measurements were made in the field on a monthly basis at 16 sites from June of 1999 to January 2001. In addition, litter was collected monthly from 2001-2002 at each of the mature forest sites and at 4 of the secondary forest sites, and mean litter mass is reported. Soil samples were collected and analyzed from several land cover types at two sites during this same time period. There are four comma-delimited ASCII data files with this data set.\r\n\r\nand chemical characterization of soils from pastures, secondary forests, and mature forests near Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil.
