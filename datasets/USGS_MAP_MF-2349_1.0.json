    "description": "This database and accompanying plot files depict the distribution of geologic\nmaterials and structures at a scale of 1:24,000.  The report is intended to\nprovide geologic information for the regional study of materials properties,\nearthquake shaking, landslide potential, mineral hazards, seismic velocity, and\nearthquake faults.  In addition, the report contains new information and\ninterpretations about the regional geologic history and framework.  However,\nthe regional scale of this report does not provide sufficient detail for site\ndevelopment purposes.  In addition, this map does not take the place of\nfault-rupture hazard zones designated by the California State Geologist (Hart\nand Bryant, 1997).  Similarly, the database cannot be used to accurately\nidentify or delineate landslides in the region.\n\nThis digital map database, compiled from previously published and unpublished\ndata, and new mapping by the authors, represents the general distribution of\nbedrock and surficial deposits in the mapped area. Together with the\naccompanying text file (skmf.txt, skmf.pdf, or skmf.ps), it provides current\ninformation on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the area covered. \nThe database delineates map units that are identified by general age and\nlithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution (scale) of\nthe database to 1:24,000 or smaller.\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (Arc/Info\ncoverages) and supporting text and plotfiles.  In addition, the report includes\ntwo sets of plotfiles (PostScript and PDF format) that will generate map sheets\nand pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field Studies Report.\n These files are described below:\n\n>ARC/INFO     Resultant    Description of Coverage\n>export file  Coverage\n>-----------  -----------  --------------------------------\n>sk-geol.e00  sk-geol/     Polygon and line coverage showing\n>                          faults, depositional contacts, and\n>                          rock units in the map area.\n>\n>sk-strc.e00  sk-strc/     Point and line coverage showing\n>                          strike and dip information and fold axes.\n>\n>sk-lnds.e00  sk-lnds/     Point and line coverage showing arrows\n>                          indicating landslide directions as well\n>                          as the locations of wells and springs\n>                          not included in the topographic base map.\n\nASCII text files, including explanatory text, ARC/INFO key files, PostScript\nand PDF plot files, and a ARC Macro Language file for conversion of ARC export\nfiles into ARC coverages:\n\n>skmf.ps                 A PostScript plot file of the pamphlet\n>                        containing detailed unit descriptions\n>                        and geological information, a description\n>                        of the digital files associated with the\n>                        publication, plus references cited.\n>\n>skmf.pdf                A PDF version of mamf.ps.\n>\n>skmf.txt                A text-only file containing an unformatted\n>                        version of skmf.ps.\n>\n>import.aml              ASCII text file in ARC Macro Language to\n>                        convert ARC export files to ARC coverages\n>                        in ARC/INFO.\n>\n>skmap.ps                A PostScript plottable file containing\n>                        an image of the geologic map and base\n>                        maps at a scale of 1:24,000, along with\n>                        a simple map key.\n>\n>skmap.pdf               A PDF file containing an image of the\n>                        geologic map and base maps at a scale\n>                        of 1:24,000, along with a simple map key.\n\nBase maps\n\nBase Map layers used in the preparation of the geologic map plotfiles were\nderived from published digital maps (Aitken, 1997) obtained from the U.S.\nGeological Survey Geologic Division Website for the Western Region\n(http://wrgis.wr.usgs.gov).
