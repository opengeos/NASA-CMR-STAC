    "description": "The data collected by Spire from it's 110 satellites launched into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has a diverse range of applications, from analysis of global trade patterns and commodity flows to aircraft routing to weather forecasting. The data also provides interesting research opportunities on topics as varied as ocean currents and GNSS-based planetary boundary layer height.  The following products can be requested:  ADS-B Data Stream Global ADS-B satellite data observed by Spire satellites and processed through the ground stations network. Historical ADS-B data older than 6 months can be delivered as data cuts containing CSV file(s) accessible through a Web Service or Cloud storage solutions. Live ADS-B data is available through a streaming API, and recent historical data can be accessed through a REST API. Data is distributed as a monthly subscription: historical data can be requested starting from 3 December 2008, the time period for live data starts from a user-defined date and continues for 30 days.  AIS AIS messages include satellite AIS (S-AIS) as observed by Spire satellites and terrestrial AIS (T-AIS) from third party sensor stations (up to 40 million messages per day). Historical AIS data are delivered as a cvs file with availability back to June 2016 or via Historical API from December 2018; live AIS data are pushed to end users via TCP or through Messages API. Data is distributed as a monthly subscription, from a user-defined date and continues for a 30 day period.  GNSS-Radio Occultation GNSS Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements are collected globally on a continuous basis, generating profiles of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Derived Level 1 and Level 2 products include both atmospheric and ionospheric products. Historical data for most of the GNSS-RO products are available from December 2018 to the present. Near real-time (within 90 minutes or less latency from collection to delivery) GNSS-RO profiles are also available upon request.  GNSS Reflectometry GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a technique to measure Earth\u2019s surface properties using reflections of GNSS signals in the form of a bistatic radar. Spire collects two types of GNSS-R data: conventional, near-nadir incidence LHCP reflections collected by the Spire GNSS-R satellites (e.g., Spire GNSS-R \u201cBatch-1\u201d satellites) and grazing angle (i.e., low elevation angle) RHCP reflections collected by the Spire GNSS-RO satellites. Derived Level 1 and Level 2 products are available, as well as some special Level 0 raw intermediate frequency (IF) data. Historical grazing angle GNSS-R data are available from May 2019 to the present, while conventional GNSS-R data are available from December 2020 to the present.
