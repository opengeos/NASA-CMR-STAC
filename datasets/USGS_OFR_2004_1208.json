    "description": "Samples of creek bed sediment collected near seal-coated parking lots in\nAustin, Texas, by the City of Austin during 2001-02 had unusually elevated\nconcentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To investigate the\npossibility that PAHs from seal-coated parking lots might be transported to\nurban creeks, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the City of\nAustin, sampled runoff and scrapings from four test plots and 13 urban parking\nlots. The surfaces sampled comprise coal-tar-emulsion-sealed,\nasphalt-emulsion-sealed, unsealed asphalt, and unsealed concrete. Particulates\nand filtered water in runoff and surface scrapings were analyzed for PAHs. In\naddition, particulates in runoff were analyzed for major and trace elements.\nSamples of all three media from coal-tar-sealed parking lots had concentrations\nof PAHs higher than those from any other types of surface. The average total\nPAH concentrations in particulates in runoff from parking lots in use were\n3,500,000, 620,000, and 54,000 micrograms per kilogram from coal-tar-sealed,\nasphalt-sealed, and unsealed (asphalt and concrete combined) lots,\nrespectively. The probable effect concentration sediment quality guideline is\n22,800 micrograms per kilogram. The average total PAH (sum of detected PAHs)\nconcentration in filtered water from parking lots in use was 8.6 micrograms per\nliter for coal-tar-sealed lots; the one sample analyzed from an asphalt-sealed\nlot had a concentration of 5.1 micrograms per liter and the one sample analyzed\nfrom an unsealed asphalt lot was 0.24 microgram per liter. The average total\nPAH concentration in scrapings was 23,000,000, 820,000, and 14,000 micrograms\nper kilogram from coal-tar-sealed, asphalt-sealed, and unsealed asphalt lots,\nrespectively. Concentrations were similar for runoff and scrapings from the\ntest plots. Concentrations of lead and zinc in particulates in runoff\nfrequently exceeded the probable effect concentrations, but trace element\nconcentrations showed no consistent variation with parking lot surface type.\n\n[Summary provided by USGS.]",
