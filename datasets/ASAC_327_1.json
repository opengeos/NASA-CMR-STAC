    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 327\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\nFrom the abstract of one of the referenced papers:\n\nA monitoring system was required to study the Doppler frequency shifts and the propagation delay of modulation (so-called group delay) of the carrier frequencies for VNG, the Standard Time Frequency and Time Signal Service transmitted by Telecom Australia from Lyndhurst, Victoria (38 degrees 33 minutes S, 145 degrees 15.7 minutes E).  The present study is a continuation of a similar monitoring of VNG on a much shorter path within Victoria.  The report describes the equipment (including HF equipment and dedicated minicomputers) used in creating a monitoring system for Macquarie Island at 54 degrees 30 minutes S, 158 degrees 57 minutes E.\n\nThe results were in the form of chart recordings and computer-produced one-minute summaries, with the real-time recordings also made during summer on an audio tape machine for later analysis.  Diurnal Doppler variations were derived from the computer data.  It is demonstrated that group delay can be more accurately determined by software signal analysis than by using a hardware level discriminator.",
