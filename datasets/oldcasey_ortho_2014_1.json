See the metadata record 'Digital Surface Model of an area at Old Casey, derived from aerial photographs taken with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), 5 February 2014' with ID 'oldcasey_DSM_2014'.\n \nThe products were requested for Australian Antarctic Science Project 4036:\nRemediation of petroleum contaminants in the Antarctic and subantarctic. \nThey cover the drainage area from a fuel spill at Old Casey that occurred in 1982.\nThe products were created from digital photos taken on the 5th February, 2014, with a UAV piloted by Dr Zybnek Malenovsky. \nThe products were georeferenced to ground control points surveyed using differential GPS by Dr Daniel Wilkins of TNE/AAD.\nHorizontal Datum: ITRF2000.",
