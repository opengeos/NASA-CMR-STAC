    "description": "This data set is part of the Pliocene Research, Interpretation, and Synoptic\nMapping (PRISM) Project.  \n\nThis data set describes marine ostracode species and related sample and\nstratigraphic information produced as part of the USGS PRISM Project (Pliocene\nResearch, Interpretation, and Synoptic Mapping).  The general goals of PRISM\nare to reconstruct global climate during a period of extreme warmth about 3\nmillion years ago and to determine the causes of the warmth and the subsequent\nclimatic change towards colder climates about 2.5 million years ago.  To do\nthis, PRISM has been studying Pliocene deposits and their microfaunas and, by\ncomparison with modern assemblages, estimating past boundary conditions such as\nocean temperatures.  To obtain more reliable estimates of past environments in\npaleoclimate studies, the use of ecologically sensitive species requires extensive modern datasets on living species with limited environmental tolerances.  Thus, much of the data generated by PRISM consists of species\ncounts from modern samples that form a \"coretop\" dataset applicable not only to\nPRISM Pliocene assemblages but also to Quaternary assemblages as well.\n\n  This situation was especially true for ostracodes, a group of Crustacea that\nincludes many species that have limited range of water temperatures required\nfor survival, reproduction, or both.  Fossil assemblages of ostracodes can\ntherefore yield information on past bottom water conditions on continental\nshelves in the mixed ocean layer above the thermocline and they are especially\nuseful where planktic foraminifers are rare or absent.  However comprehensive\ndatasets with quantitative ostracode data were not available for application to\nregional paleoceanographic studies.  Further, because of the endemic nature of\nostracodes living on continental shelves, separate modern datasets needed to be\ndeveloped for regions of the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.  The data\ncontained in the files in this folder come from the western North Pacific\nOcean, mainly the seas around Japan.  These regions encompass subtropical to\ncold temperate and subfrigid marine climate zones and include faunas from the\nmajor Western North Pacific water masses such as the Oyashio and Kuroshio\ncurrent systems.\n\n  The ostracode data sets were developed in collaboration with Prof. Noriyuki\nIkeya, Institute of Geosciences, Shizuoka University, Shizuoka, Japan, Prof.\nIkeya's students, and other Japanese colleagues,  with support from the USGS\nGlobal Change and Climate History Program and grants from the National Science\nFoundation (NSF grant INT: LTV-9013402) and the Japanese Society for the\nPromotion of Science (JSPS grant EPAR- 093).  Most of the faunal slides are\nhoused at Shizuoka University.\n\n Separate PRISM ostracode data sets contain modern and Pliocene species data\nfrom continental shelves of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans and from deep sea\nenvironments.\n\n Among the various types of quantitative analyses used to evaluate the\nostracode data, the Squared Chord Distance (SCD) coefficient of dissimilarity\nwas found to be useful in identifying modern analog assemblages for fossil\nassemblages on the basis of the proportions of shared species between two\nsamples.\n\n  The ostracode data and analyses of them are discussed in detail in the\nfollowing published scientific papers:\n\n    Ikeya, Noriyuki and Cronin, Thomas.
