    "description": "ADEOS-II/AMSR L1B dataset is obtained from the AMSR sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) was launched on December 14, 2002 (Japanese Standard Time). The objective of ADEOS-II was to acquire data to contribute to international global climate change research, as well as for applications such as meteorology and fishery.AMSR observes various physical contents concerning to water (H2O) by receiving weak microwaves naturally radiated from the Earth's surface and atmosphere and also regardless of day or night, the presence of clouds. Those sensors aim at collecting global data for mainly understanding the circulation of water and energy.This dataset includes the brightness temperature converted by the radiometric correction coefficients from observed sensor data of level 1A. It also contains the ancillary data stored in level 1A product. The physical quantity unit is Kelvin.For AMSR/AMSR-E, they correspond to brightness temperatures. Data location and quality information are also included. Data are not map-projected, but stored in the swath format.The provided format is HDF4. The current version of the product is \"Version 3\". The generation unit is scene(defined as a half orbit).",
