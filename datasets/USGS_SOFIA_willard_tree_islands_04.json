    "description": "Analysis of 209 pollen assemblages from surface samples in ten vegetation types in the Florida Everglades form the basis to identify wetland sub-environments from the pollen record. This calibration dataset makes it possible to infer past trends in hydrology and disturbance regime based on pollen assemblages preserved in sediment cores. Pollen assemblages from sediment cores collected in different vegetation types throughout the Everglades provide evidence on wetland response to natural fluctuations in climate as well as impacts of human alteration of Everglades hydrology. Sediment cores were located primarily in sawgrass marshes, cattail marshes, tree islands, sawgrass ridges, sloughs, marl prairies, and mangroves. The datasets contain raw data on pollen abundance as well as pollen concentration (pollen grains per gram dry sediment).\n\nEverglades restoration planning requires an understanding of the impact of natural and human-induced environmental change on wetland stability, and this project focuses specifically on three wetland types: tree islands, the sawgrass ridge and slough system, and marl prairies. Tree islands are considered key indicators of the health of the Everglades ecosystem because of their sensitivity to both flooding and drought conditions. Tree islands also act as a sink for nutrients in the ecosystem and may play an important role in regulating nutrient dynamics. Although management strategies to restore and even create tree islands are being formulated, the published data on their age, developmental history, geochemistry, and response to hydrologic alterations is limited. To address these issues, this project integrates floral and geochemical data with geologic and vegetational mapping activities to establish the timing of tree-island formation and impacts of both flooding and droughts on tree islands throughout the Everglades.",
