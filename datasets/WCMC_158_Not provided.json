    "description": "As part of the species activities, WCMC maintains nomenclature,\n      distribution and conservation status information on some 18,000 animal\n      species and subspecies worldwide. WCMC stores animal information in a\n      series of Foxpro database files which include data on single country\n      endemics, globally threatened species, and species included on various\n      International Conventions. These animal data are currently being\n      converted from Foxpro to A-Rev. For further details of structure see\n      Plant Species Database description.\n      \n      The basic data elements on species conservation include scientific and\n      common names, distribution by country and conservation status.\n      Additional information on population size, trends and habitat are\n      sought wherever possible. For species subject to wildlife trade,\n      information on levels of trade, impact on wild populations, protection\n      and management measures are important.\n      \n      WCMC publishes the Red List of Threatened Animals in collaboration\n      with IUCN and the Species Survival Commission. All the data are held\n      on computer, including nomenclature, common names, distribution,\n      conservation status, threats, etc. The Centre is actively seeking\n      collaboration to prepare digital distribution maps for threatened\n      animals and plants, but this work is at an early stage.\n      \n      LANGUAGE:\n        English\n      \n      STATISTICAL INFORMATION:\n      \n      ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION:\n      \n      WCMC makes information available through published media, through\n      provision of datasets, and through the provision of either standard or\n      customised reports.  WCMC is committed to the principle of the free\n      exchange of data with other institutions and users. In so far as is\n      practical, it places its data in the public domain and encourages\n      their wide distribution. However, costs may be incurred in accessing\n      and distributing datasets, and where analysis and assessment provide\n      an added-value service. Such costs are passed on to the user.",
