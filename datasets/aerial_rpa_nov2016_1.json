    "description": "The Australian Antarcic Division (AAD) contracted Helicopter Resources to fly remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) on Voyage 1 2016/17. The RPA were used to take aerial photographs for sea ice reconnaisance from the RSV Aurora Australis, aerial photographs of Davis, aerial photographs for building roof inspections at Davis and aerial photographs of part of Heidemann Valley. Video was also recorded from the RSV Aurora Australis and of Heidemann Valley. The flights over Heidemann Valley were done at the request of the AAD's Antarctic Modernisation Taskforce. The roof inspections were done at the request of the AAD's Infrastructure section. \n\nThe following can be downloaded or requested from this metadata record by AAD staff only (see Related URLs): \n1 A report prepared by Doug Thost, the chief RPA pilot; \n2 The aerial photographs of Davis and Heidemann Valley; and \n3 Some panoramas created from aerial photographs taken at Davis. \n\nThe AAD's Multimedia section have a copy of the videos. The AAD's Infrastructure section have a copy of the aerial photographs taken for roof inspections. \n\nSee the report for further details.",
