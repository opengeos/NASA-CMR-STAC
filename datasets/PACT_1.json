    "description": "PACT is a scientific research Action Group project of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR; http://www.scar.org/), conducted under the Standing Scientific Group on Physical Sciences (SSG-PS; http://www.scar.org/researchgroups/physicalscience/ ). It is a specialised project for scientific workers in the fields of atmospheric and climate research.\n\nThe goal of PACT is to provide a unique and convenient set of observational data and analyses derived from high-latitude ozonesonde measurements to help improve understanding of the distribution and variability of ozone in the extratropical tropopause region and the feedbacks of ozone change to polar\nclimate.\n\nObjectives\nPACT will produce a documented database consisting of the following information derived from existing high latitude ozonesonde measurements;\n\n1. High resolution profiles of ozone mixing ratio and partial pressure in the vicinity of the tropopause.\n2. The height of the chemical tropopause.\n3. Ten-day forward and backward trajectory information at selected potential temperature surfaces intersected by the ozonesonde profiles.\n4. Other relevant diagnostic information derived from radiosonde measurements and data assimilations (including lapse rate tropopause location, and interpolated potential vorticity and potential temperature associated with the ozonesonde measurements).\n\nThe specific information gathered by PACT is aimed to help model studies of the UTLS region particularly the validation of heating and cooling rates and the transport fluxes of trace gases. Data will be made available through the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) and the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA; https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/weather-balloon/integrated-global-radiosonde-archive).\n\nPACT data may be useful in the following studies:\nRadiative and chemical processes in the tropopause region.\nTrace gas transport and exchange between the troposphere and stratosphere.\nOzone microphysics.\nLong-term changes and variability in the structure and composition of the lower atmosphere.\nFeedbacks of climate change.\nValidation of coupled chemistry-climate models and atmospheric measurements.",
