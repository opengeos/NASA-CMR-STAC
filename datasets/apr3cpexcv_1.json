    "description": "The Airborne Precipitation Radar 3rd Generation (APR-3) CPEX-CV dataset consists of radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity for all bands, linear depolarization ratio Ku-band, and normalized radar cross-section measurements at Ka- and Ku- bands data collected by the APR-3 onboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft. These data were gathered during the Convective Processes Experiment \u2013 Cabo Verde (CPEX-CV) field campaign. The NASA CPEX-CV field campaign will be based out of Sal Island, Cabo Verde from August through September 2022. The campaign is a continuation of CPEX \u2013 Aerosols and Winds (CPEX-AW) and was conducted aboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft equipped with remote sensors and dropsonde-launch capability that will allow for the measurement of tropospheric aerosols, winds, temperature, water vapor, and precipitation. The overarching CPEX-CV goal was to investigate atmospheric dynamics, marine boundary layer properties, convection, the dust-laden Saharan Air Layer, and their interactions across various spatial scales to improve understanding and predictability of process-level lifecycles in the data-sparse tropical East Atlantic region. These data files are available from September 2, 2022, through September 30, 2022, in netCDF-4 format, with associated browse imagery in JPG format. \r\n",
