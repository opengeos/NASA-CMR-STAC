    "description": "A seismotectonic map shows geologic, seismological, and other information that\nis pertinent to seismic hazards but previously was scattered among many\nsources. Afghanistan is part of the Eurasian plate. Afghan seismicity is driven\nby the relative northward movements of the Arabian plate past western\nAfghanistan at 33 mm/yr and of the Indian plate past eastern Afghanistan at 39\nmm/yr or faster as both plates subduct under Eurasia. Afghanistan is laced with\nfaults. Known faults large enough to have been mapped at a scale of 1:500,000\nare least abundant in the stable North Afghan platform, more abundant in the\naccreted terranes of southern Afghanistan, and most likely to slip rapidly and\ngenerate earthquakes in eastern and southeastern Afghanistan in the broad\ntranspressional plate boundary with the Indian plate. Crustal earthquakes are\nmost abundant in and around northeastern Afghanistan as a result of the\nnorthward subduction of the Indian plate. Crustal earthquakes are somewhat less\nabundant in much of the transpressional plate boundary with India. Central and\nwestern Afghanistan are least seismically active. Beneath the Hindu Kush of\nnortheastern Afghanistan and the Pamirs of adjacent Tajikistan, numerous mantle\nearthquakes occur within a steeply dipping, northeast-trending, tabular zone\nthat is 700 km long and extends nearly to 300 km depth. Except for the Chaman\nfault that forms part of the western edge of the transpressional plate boundary\nin Pakistan and Afghanistan, published evidence for or against the activity of\nindividual Afghan faults is sparse.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
