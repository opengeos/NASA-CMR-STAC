The maps were prepared by Environmental Systems Research\nInstitute (ESRI), USA.  Most data for the database were provided by\nthe Soil Resources, Management and Conservation Service Land and Water\nDevelopment Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\nItaly. This dataset was developed in collaboration with the United\nNations Environment Program (UNEP), Kenya.  The manuscript derived\nfrom the topographic film separates of the UNESCO/FAO Soil Map of the\nWorld (1977) in Miller Oblated Stereographic projection was used to\nprovide a generalized coverage of elevation values providing\ninformation as both line-related and polygonal form.  The map was\nprepared by overlaying the topography film separate with a matte\ndrafting film and then delineating the selected elevation contours.\nSome of the line crenulation was removed during the delineation\nprocess, because this map was designed to define general elevation\nzones rather than constitute a true topographic base.  Code values\nwere recorded directly on the map and were key-entered during the\ndigitizing process with a spatial resolution of 0.002 inches, as part\nof the polygon or line sequence indentification number. The map was\nthen transformed from inch coordinates to latitude/longitude\ndegrees. The transformation was done using an unpublished algorithm of\nthe US Geological Survey and ESRI to create coverages for one-degree\ngraticules.  Contact: UNEP/GRID-Nairobi, P.O.
