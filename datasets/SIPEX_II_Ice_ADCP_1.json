    "description": "A 600KHz Teledyne RDI Workhorse Sentinel ADCP was deployed through a 10inch auger hole, flush with the base of the ice, looking downwards. At ice stations 2, 3, and 4 the deployment locations was Ridge site 1, the ridge site closest to the ship.\n\nAt ice station 7 there were 4 different deployment locations:\n- Transducer Hole A, by active ridge on 6th October 2012;\n- Trace Metal / Bio Site;\n- 100m Core site of ice-physics transect;\n- Transducer Hole A, re-drilled on 7th October 2012.\n\nLength of deployment varies from stations to station and was limited by AUV operations, when our ADCP was switched off. \n\nFiles contain the data collected in raw format. This format can be read by Teledyne WinSC software.  Data files are stored in folders by ice station (see below).",
