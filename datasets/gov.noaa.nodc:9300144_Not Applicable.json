    "description": "The water depth and temperature data were collected in Coastal Waters of Gulf of Mexico, NW Atlantic (limit-40 W) as part of Louisiana-Texas (LATEX part C) Gulf of Mexico Eddy Circulation Study from CAPE HENLOPEN, and DRIFTING PLATFORM between August 13, 1992 and June 5, 1993. The originator's CTD and ARGOS tracked drifting buoy data containing 2,821 records were submitted by Dr. Thomas Berger, Science Applications, Inc. Raleigh NC. The study was supported by grant no MMS 14-35-0001-30633.\n\nLATEX is a three-part, $16.2 million federal initiative funded by the U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior. The study was conducted to aid MMS in reducing risks associated with oil and gas operations on the continental shelf along the Texas and Louisiana coasts from the mouth of the Mississippi River to the Rio Grande.\n\nBegun in September 1991, it was the largest physical oceanography program ever undertaken in the Gulf. The program consists of three major parts: LATEX A, B, and C, conducted by the Texas A&M University System (TAMUS), Louisiana State University (LSU), and Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC), respectively.\n\nLATEX C was carried out by researchers at SAIC and the University of Colorado. Loop Current eddies, slope eddies, and squirts and jets within the Gulf of Mexico were located and tracked by air-deployed temperature profiling instruments and drifting buoys. Using these data, scientists assessed the impact of these Gulf-wide, circulation features on shelf circulation and identified the processes that interact with the shelf. The data is currently available in F022-CTD-Hi-Resolution and F156-Drifting-Buoy file formats of NODC.",
