    "description": "The Williamson River Basin, located in south-central Oregon, has a drainage\narea of approximately 3,000 square miles. The Sprague River, which flows into\nthe Williamson River Basin, has a drainage area of 1,580 square miles.\nTogether, the Williamson and Sprague Rivers supply about one-half of the inflow\nto Upper Klamath Lake. Various statistical techniques, which included trend\ntests, double-mass curves, and two-sample tests, were used to detect\nsignificant changes in the precipitation-runoff relation for the Williamson and\nSprague River Basins. Flows from these two rivers were compared with the\nprecipitation and air temperature records collected at Klamath Falls to assess\nthe effect of climate on flow variations.\n\n   Most of the double-mass curves showed a major break in the slope of the\ncurve\noccurring around 1950 and a smaller one near 1990. For the years 1930-50 and\n1990-96, February through May flows were relatively lower in the Williamson\nRiver than in rivers in nearby basins, by an average of 25,000 acre-feet per\nyear and 36,000 acre-feet per year, respectively, for the 4-month period. From\n1950 through 1963, flows were generally higher in the Williamson River compared\nwith the nearby rivers by an average of 38,000 acre-feet for the 4 months. In\nJuly through September of 1945-51, 1970-76, and 1992-96, flows were lower in\nthe Williamson River than in the comparison rivers by an average of about 6,000\nacre-feet for the 3-month period. Two-sample statistical tests of the annual\nflow data sets for the Williamson and Sprague Rivers showed significant\nincrease in the estimated population mean for the period 1951-96 compared to\nthe estimated population mean for the period 1922-50. However, climate data,\nwhich included annual precipitation data from Klamath Falls, Crater Lake, and\nMedford, and annual air temperature data from Klamath Falls, all showed no\nsignificant difference between the two periods. During the past century,\nvarious human land-use activities, such as irrigation, grazing, drainage, and\ntimber harvesting, may have had some impact on the hydrology within the\nWilliamson River Basin. However, relating specific land-use activities to\nchanges in flow is impossible to assess owing to the size and geologic\ncomplexity of the basin and to the paucity of historical land- and water-use\ndata for local areas.\n\nThe area of study was Upper Klamath Lake Basin, Oregon, Williamson and Sprague\nRivers.\n\nStatistical techniques were used to analyze the Williamson and Sprague River\nstreamflow data.  Trend analysis was used to detect an increase or decrease in\nstreamflow for the period of record as measured near the mouth of each river. \nDouble-mass curve analysis was used to detect possible changes in runoff\npatterns during the period of record that could indicate human influences in\nthe basins.  Long-term precipitation and air temperature data collected near\nthe basins were used in these analyses to remove the influence of climate from\nthe runoff data.\n\nThe information for this metadata was taken from the Online Publications of the\nOregon District at http://oregon.usgs.gov/pubs_dir/online_list.html .",
