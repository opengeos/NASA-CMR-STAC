    "description": "The main objective of this NASA-funded project was to develop a remote sensing and modeling capability to monitor and predict ecosystem changes in coastal Arctic waters, in particular, changes in primary production and organic carbon dynamics, due to changing riverine fluxes caused by recent warming trends. Research activities focused on the coastal waters around Colville, Kuparuk, and Sagavanirktok rivers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 three of the largest rivers in the North Slope of Alaska. Changing riverine fluxes affect light and nutrient availability \u00e2\u0080\u0093 two most critical factors affecting primary production \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in a complex manner. Understanding how riverine materials transported into the coastal Arctic mix with ocean waters and affect primary production and phytoplankton community structure using a combination of in situ data, remote sensing measurements, and modeling was the overarching objective of this effort.\u00c2\u00a0Project funding was through NASA OBB Award: 80NSSC22K1043 (to CCNY, PI: Maria Tzortziou) and NASA OBB Award: 80HQTR21T0050 (to NRL, PI: Wes Moses).",
