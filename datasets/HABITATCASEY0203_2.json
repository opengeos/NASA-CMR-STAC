    "description": "Very little information is available on the geomorphology of areas surrounding Australian Antarctic stations. This type of information is generally collected during geological surveys. This metadata record gathers a range of descriptive geomorphological information of various nature: \n\n-Habitat surveys were conducted in the season 2002-2003 in the Windmill Islands in parallel with bird nest mapping (reported in metadata record BIRDSCASEY0203) in order to study selection of nest sites by a range of species. Habitat was described in the survey sites searched for bird nests following various methods (described in BIRDSCASEY0203). Information is stored as GIS files (Arcview 3.2)\n-polygon shapefile gathering all the geomorphological units.\n-line shapefile describing habitat along transects used for searching bird nests\n-polygon shapefile describing habitat in small 25*25m quadrats used for searching bird nests\n\n-A collection of 1309 digital photos showing the sites searched for bird nests indexed by grid site number. Plus another set of 194 photos showing region of the Windmill Islands or bird nests more in detail\n-A set of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) covering the entire Windmill Islands area generated separately for 18 regions.\n-200m*200m grid created from the coverage of ice-free areas (Aerial photography 93-94) providing site numbers for the photographic database\n-A series of Black and White aerial Photos (500 m, Zeiss, 1994) scanned at high resolution for the purpose of substrate study.\n\nSee the word document in the file download for more information.\n\nThis work has been completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nDate\nBoulderbig\nBouldsmall\nBaresubst\nMorsed\nScree\nSnowcover\nPermice\nSlope\nAspect\nPhotonumber\nSitedotid\nComments",
