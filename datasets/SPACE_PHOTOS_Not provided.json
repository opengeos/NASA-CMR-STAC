    "description": "Gemini photography was acquired between March 23, 1965 and November 15, 1966. The images were collected as part of the Synoptic Terrain Photography and the Synoptic Weather Photography experiments during Gemini Missions III through XII. Hand-held cameras were used to obtain photographs of geologic, oceanic, and meteorologic targets. The Gemini archive consists primarily of 70-mm black and white (B/W), color, and color-infrared (CIR) film. All Gemini photographs are distributed by the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center as digital products only.\n\nSkylab photography was acquired between May 22, 1973 and February 8, 1974 during three manned flights. The Skylab Earth Resources Experiment Package used two photographic remote sensing systems. The Multispectral Photographic Camera (S190A), was a six-camera array, in which each camera used 70-mm film and a six-inch focal length lens. The acquired film ranges from narrow-band B/W to broad-band color and CIR. The Earth Terrain Camera (S190B) consisted of a single high-resolution camera which used five-inch film and an 18-inch focal length lens. The acquired film includes B/W, black and white infrared (BIR), color, and CIR. All Skylab photographs are distributed by the USGS EDC as digital products only.\n\nShuttle Large Format Camera (LFC) images were acquired from the Space Shuttle Challenger Mission on October 5-13, 1984. The LFC was mounted in the cargo bay, and was operated via signals from ground controllers. The archived imagery includes 9 x 18 inch B/W, natural color, and CIR film. Shuttle LFC photographs are distributed by the USGS EDC as digital products only.",
