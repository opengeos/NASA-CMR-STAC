    "description": "The Global Hyperspectral Imaging Spectral-library of Agricultural crops (GHISA) is a comprehensive compilation, collation, harmonization, and standardization of hyperspectral signatures of agricultural crops of the world. This hyperspectral library of agricultural crops is developed for all major world crops and was collected by United States Geological Survey (USGS) and partnering volunteer agencies from around the world. Crops include wheat, rice, barley, corn, soybeans, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, chickpeas, lentils, and pigeon peas, which together occupy about 65% of all global cropland areas. The GHISA spectral libraries were collected and collated using spaceborne, airborne (e.g., aircraft and drones), and ground based hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy. \n\nThe GHISA for the Conterminous United States (GHISACONUS) Version 1 product provides dominant crop data in different growth stages for various agroecological zones (AEZs) of the United States. The GHISA hyperspectral library of the five major agricultural crops (e.g., winter wheat, rice, corn, soybeans, and cotton) for CONUS was developed using Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion hyperspectral data acquired from 2008 through 2015 from different AEZs of CONUS using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer ([CDL](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/)) as reference data.\n\nGHISACONUS is comprised of seven AEZs throughout the United States covering the major agricultural crops in six different growth stages: emergence/very early vegetative (Emerge VEarly), early and mid vegetative (Early Mid), late vegetative (Late), critical, maturing/senescence (Mature Senesc), and harvest. The crop growth stage data were derived using crop calendars generated by the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment ([SAGE](https://nelson.wisc.edu/sage/)), University of Wisconsin-Madison. \n\nProvided in the CSV file is the spectral library including image information, geographic coordinates, corresponding agroecological zone, crop type labels, and crop growth stage labels for the United States.",
