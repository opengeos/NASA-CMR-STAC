    "description": "AmeriFlux  [http://ameriflux.lbl.gov/] is part of the larger             network  Fluxnet  [http://daac.ornl.gov/FLUXNET/fluxnet.shtml] which             endeavors to connect observations from regional micrometeorological             tower sites for global analysis. AmeriFlux towers measure the             exchange of energy, water, and carbon through a network of sites             with variable vegetation, disturbance records, and climatic             conditions. The ecosystems included within the network are temperate             and tropical evergreen forests, temperate deciduous forests,             woodlands, grasslands, agricultural crops, boreal, and shrublands.             Climates in these biomes vary between tundra, temperate, tropical,             and arid.              \n\nThis Level 4 Dataset accumulated from the AmeriFlux Network focuses             on hourly, daily, and monthly observations collected at North             American tower sites. The selection of AmeriFlux sites were chosen             based on the period of available data, the diversity in vegetation             types, the past success of testing land surface models, and the             availability of atmospheric forcing for Community Land Models.             AmeriFlux Level 4 data has been gap-filled, quality-flagged and             includes meteorological variables, CO2 exchange rates, heat fluxes,             biogeochemical pools, calculated gross productivity, and ecosystem             respiration terms. The period of record varies by individual tower             site, but some sites have as much as 15 years of recorded data.",
