    "description": "Decommisioned product.\r\n\r\nThe 16-day 0.05Deg global albedo product (MCD43C1) is a Level-3 Climate Modeling Grid product that provides measures of Earth's white-sky and black-sky albedo.  These measures are derived averages computed from the 16-Day 1 km global albedo product (MCD43B3). The 1 km global albedo is computed by integrating the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which describes the characteristic anisotropy of the land surface.  The MODIS BRDF parameters are modeled by inverting multi-date, multi-angular, cloud-free, atmospherically corrected surface reflectance observations acquired by MODIS over a 16-day period.\r\n\r\nBlack-sky albedo and white-sky albedo mark the extreme cases of both completely direct and diffuse illumination. Black-sky albedo, or directional hemispherical reflectance, is defined as albedo in the absence of a diffuse component and is a measure of a surface's relative brightness when illuminated from a certain angle.  MODIS black-sky albedo is calculated at the solar zenith angle of local solar noon.  White-sky albedo, or bi-hemispherical reflectance, is defined as albedo in the absence of a direct component when the diffuse component is isotropic.\r\n\r\nMCD products are generated using a combination of Terra and Aqua acquisitions to optimize data quality.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  These products are validated, meaning that product uncertainties are well defined over a range of representative conditions. Although there may be later improved versions, these data are ready for use in scientific publications.\r\n\r\nData Set Characteristics\r\nArea = Global\r\nImage Dimensions = 3 (3600x7200x10 row/column/band)\r\nAverage File Size = ~1126 MB\r\nResolution = 0.05 degree (~5 km)\r\nProjection = Latitude/Longitude Grid\r\nData Type Albedo = 16-bit Signed Integer\r\nData Type Quality = 32-bit Unsigned Integer\r\nData Format = HDF-EOS\r\nScience Data Sets (SDS) = 3",
