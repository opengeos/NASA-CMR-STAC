    "description": "Water samples were collected in streams and springs in the karst terrane of the\nSinking Creek Basin in 2004 as part of study in cooperation with the Kentucky\nDepartment of Agriculture. A total of 48 water samples were collected at 7\nsites (4 springs, 2 streams, and 1 karst window) from April through November\n2004. The karst terrane of the Sinking Creek Basin (also known as Boiling\nSpring Basin) encompasses about 125 square miles in Breckinridge County and\nportions of Meade and Hardin Counties in Kentucky.\n\nFourteen pesticides were detected of the 52 pesticides analyzed in the stream\nand spring samples. Of the 14 detected pesticides, 12 were herbicides and 2\nwere insecticides. The most commonly detected pesticides; atrazine, simazine,\nmetolachlor, and acetochlor-were those most heavily used on crops during the\nstudy. Atrazine was detected in 100 percent of all samples; simazine,\nmetolachlor, and acetochlor were detected in more than 35 percent of all\nsamples. The pesticide-transformation compound, deethylatrazine, was detected\nin 98 percent of the samples. Only one nonagricultural herbicide, prometon, was\ndetected in more than 30 percent of the samples. Malathion, the most commonly\ndetected insecticide, was found in 4 percent of the samples, which was followed\nby carbofuran (2 percent).\n\nMost of the pesticides were present in low concentrations; however, atrazine\nwas found in springs exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's\n(USEPA) standards for drinking water. Atrazine exceeded the USEPA's maximum\ncontaminant level 2 times in 48 detections.\n\nConcentrations of nitrate greater than 10 milligrams per liter (mg/L) were not\nfound in water samples from any of the sites. Concentrations of nitrite plus\nnitrate ranged from 0.21 to 3.9 mg/L at the seven sites. The median\nconcentration of nitrite plus nitrate for all sites sampled was 1.5 mg/L.\nConcentrations of nitrite plus nitrate generally were higher in the springs\nthan in the main stem of Sinking Creek.\n\nForty-two percent of the concentrations of total phosphorus at all seven sites\nexceeded the USEPA's recommended maximum concentration of 0.1 mg/L. The median\nconcentration of total phosphorus for all sites sampled was 0.09 mg/L. The\nhighest median concentrations of total phosphorus were found in the springs.\nMedian concentrations of orthophosphate followed the same pattern as\nconcentrations of total phosphorus in the springs. Concentrations of\northophosphate ranged from 0.006 to 0.192 mg/L.\n\nConcentrations of suspended sediment generally were low throughout the basin;\nthe median concentration of suspended sediment for all sites sampled was 23\nmg/L. The highest concentration of suspended sediment (1,486 mg/L) was measured\nfollowing a storm event at Sinking Creek near Lodiburg, Ky.",
