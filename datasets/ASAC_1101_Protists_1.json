    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 1101\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nMost of our knowledge of the Antarctic marine ecosystems comes from summer surveys. There are very few observations of this ecosystem in winter and there is a fundamental lack of knowledge of understanding of even basic questions such as 'what is there?' and 'what's it doing?'.  The proposed visit to the sea ice zone in winter is a rare opportunity to conduct observations on phytoplankton, krill, birds, seals and whales, so that we can begin to understand the biological processes that go on in winter.\n\nData for this project were intended to be collected on a 1998 winter voyage of the Aurora Australis, but a fire on board meant that the voyage had to return to port before work could be carried out.\n\nData were then collected the following year during a 1999 winter voyage of the Aurora Australis (IDIOTS), which ran from July to September.\n\nData attached to this metadata record, include protist, bacteria and virus data collected from the Mertz Glacier region.\n\nThe purpose of this research was to quantify and identify the different assemblages of phytoplankton, change in virus populations and the number of live/dead bacteria between Tasmania and the polynya, within the polynya and sea ice.   A variety of methods were used including HPLC, light and fluorescent microscopy and the collection of samples for subsequent analysis upon return to the Antarctic Division.  \n\nMore information is available in the download file.\n\nThe samples were collected by Rick van den Enden.",
