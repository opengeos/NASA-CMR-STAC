    "description": "The Lambert Glacier Basin (LGB) series of five oversnow traverses were conducted from 1989-95. Snow accumulation rate measurements were recorded every 2 km along the 2014 km main traverse track from LGB00 (68.6543 S, 61.1201 E) near Mawson Station to LGB72 (69.9209 S, 76.4933 E) near Davis Station, and at 7 selected sites around the basin where local accumulation cane farm gridded arrays were established.\n\nRaw data were manually recorded in field logbooks and later entered into spreadsheet files (MS Excel).\n\nSummary data (2 km spatial resolution) can be obtained from CRC Research Note No.09 'Surface mass balance and snow surface properties from the Lambert Glacier Basin Traverses 1990-94'.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 3 and 2216.\n\nSome of this data have been stored in a very old format.  The majority of files have been updated to current formats, but some files (kaleidograph files in particular) were not able to be modified due to a lack of appropriate software.  However, these files are simply figures, and can be regenerated from the raw data (also provided).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nLatitude\nLongitude\nHeight\nCane\nDistance\nElevation\nDensity\nMass Accumulation\nYear\nDelta Oxygen-18\nGrain Size\nIce Crusts\nDepth Hoar\n\nAll logbooks have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nCopies of the document details forms for the logbooks is available for download from the provided URL.",
