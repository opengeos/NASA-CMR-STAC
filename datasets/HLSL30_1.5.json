    "description": "The HLSL30 V1.5 data product was decommissioned on January 4, 2022. Users are encouraged to use the improved [HLSL30 V2](https://doi.org/10.5067/HLS/HLSL30.002) data product.\n\nThe Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface reflectance (SR) and top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Europe\u2019s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2\u20133 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment. \n\nThe HLSL30 product provides 30-m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from Landsat 8 OLI data products. The [HLSS30](https://doi.org/10.5067/HLS/HLSS30.015) and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System ([MGRS](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/)) tiling system and thus are \u201cstackable\u201d for time series analysis.\n\nThe HLSL30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed as a separate file. There are 10 bands included in the HLSL30 product along with one quality assessment (QA) band and four angle bands. For a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSL30 product, please see the User Guide.\n\nProvisional HLS V1.5 data have not been validated for their science quality and should not be used in science research or applications.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* HLSL30.015 products are based on input Landsat 8 L1TP (precision terrain corrected) products, which require identification of ground control targets for precision geometric correction. Images where ground control is not available (e.g., very cloudy images) cannot be processed to L1TP and are not included in the HLSL30 dataset.\n\n* Interruptions in data service occurred during a restaging of backlogged data between June 1 and June 15, 2021 for both HLSS30 and HLSL30 version 1.5 data products. During this time period increased errors in the processing workflow resulted in a significant number of data ingestion failures and thus, significant gaps in data availability. Given the pending release of the version 2.0, science quality HLS products, these missing data will not be filled for version 1.5. Users of the provisional version 1.5 products should be aware of the significant data gap in this two week window. The version 2.0 products will incorporate these data back into the archive.  If you have any feedback or questions on the data please contact [Customer Services](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/lp-daac/contact) or join our HLS conversion on the [Earthdata Forum](https://forum.earthdata.nasa.gov/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=618&hilit=hls&sid=95750d868b6448e0f4360a1473def234). \n",
