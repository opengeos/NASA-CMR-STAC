    "description": "The data set for the Cougar Buttes quadrangle has been prepared by the\nSouthern California Areal Mapping Project (SCAMP), a cooperative project\nsponsored jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Division of\nMines and Geology, as part of an ongoing effort to utilize a Geographical\nInformation System (GIS) format to create a regional digital geologic database\nfor southern California. This regional database is being developed as a\ncontribution to the National Geologic Map Data Base of the National Cooperative\nGeologic Mapping Program of the USGS. Development of the data set for the\nCougar Buttes quadrangle has also been supported by the Mojave Water Agency and\nU.S. Forest Service, San Bernardino National Forest.\n\nThe digital geologic map database for the Cougar Buttes quadrangle has been\ncreated as a general-purpose data set that is applicable to other land-related\ninvestigations in the earth and biological sciences. In cooperation with the\nWater Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey, we have used our\nmapping in the Cougar Buttes and adjoining quadrangles together with well log\ndata to develop a hydrogeologic framework for the basin. In an effort to\nunderstand surficial processes and to provide a base suitable for ecosystem\nassessment, we have differentiated surficial veneers on piedmont and pediment\nsurfaces and distinguished the various substrates found beneath these veneers. \nCurrently, the geologic database for the Cougar Buttes quadrangle is being\napplied in groundwater investigations in the Lucerne Valley basin (USGS, Water\nResources Division), in biological species studies of the Cushenbury Canyon\narea (U.S. Forest Service, San Bernardino National Forest), and in the study of\nsoils on various Quaternary landscape surfaces on the north piedmont of the San\nBernardino Mountains (University of New Mexico). The Cougar Buttes database is\nnot suitable for site-specific geologic evaluations at scales greater than\n1:24,000 (1 in = 2,000 ft).\n\n\nThis data set maps and describes the geology of the Cougar Buttes 7.5'\nquadrangle, San Bernardino County, California. Created using Environmental\nSystems Research Institute's ARC/INFO software, the data base consists of the\nfollowing items: (1) a map coverage showing geologic contacts and units, (2) a\nseparate coverage layer showing structural data, (3) a scanned topographic base\nat a scale of 1:24,000, and (4) attribute tables for geologic units (polygons),\ncontacts (arcs), and site-specific data (points). The data base is accompanied\nby a readme file and this metadata file. In addition, the data set includes the\nfollowing graphic and text products: (1) A portable document file (.pdf)\ncontaining a browse-graphic of the geologic map on a 1:24,000 topographic base.\nThe map is accompanied by a marginal explanation consisting of a Description of\nMap Units (DMU), a Correlation of Map Units (CMU), and a key to point and line\nsymbols. (2) Separate .pdf files of the DMU and CMU, individually. (3) A\nPostScript graphic plot-file containing the geologic map on a 1:24,000\ntopographic base accompanied by the marginal explanation. (4) A pamphlet that\nsummarizes the late Cenozoic geology of the Cougar Buttes quadrangle.\n\nThe geologic map data base contains original U.S. Geological Survey data\ngenerated by detailed field observation and by interpretation of aerial\nphotographs, including low-altitude color and black-and-white photographs and\nhigh-altitude infrared photographs. The map was created by transferring lines\nfrom the aerial photographs to a 1:24,000 topographic base via a mylar\northophoto-quadrangle or by using a PG-2 plotter. The map was then scribed,\nscanned, and imported into ARC/INFO, where the database was built. Within the\ndatabase, geologic contacts are represented as lines (arcs), geologic units as\npolygons, and site-specific data as points. Polygon, arc, and point attribute\ntables (.pat, .aat, and .pat, respectively) uniquely identify each geologic\ndatum and link it to other tables (.rel) that provide more detailed geologic\ninformation.",
