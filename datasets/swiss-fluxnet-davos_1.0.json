    "description": "The Swiss FluxNet Site Davos is a managed subalpine evergreen forest, located on the Seehorn mountain near Davos in the Swiss Alps. The site is dominated by Norway spruce. The tower is owned by the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN).   Ecosystem flux measurements of CO2, H2O (since 1997) as well as CH4 and N2O (since 2016) are performed with the eddy covariance method.   In addition to Swiss FluxNet, the site is part of the National Air Pollution Monitoring Network (NABEL), the Long term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF), the biological drought and growth indicator network (TreeNet) and of ICOS Switzerland (Integrated Carbon Observation System). Since November 2019, the site is an ICOS Class 1 Ecosystem station.    __Measurements__    - Ecosystem flux measurements of CO2, H2O vapour (since 1997) as well a CH4 and N2O (since 2016) are performed with the eddy-covariance method. This method is based on measurements of trace gas mixing ratios, using infrared gas analyzers (for CO2, H2O vapor) and laser spectrometers (for CH4 and N2O), combined with wind speed and wind direction measurements, using 3D sonic anemometers. To resolve the short-term turbulent fluctuations in the atmosphere, very fast measurements are needed: we measure at 10-20 Hz, i.e., 10-20 times per second. To assess the energy budget of each ecosystem, also radiation sensors and soil climate profiles are installed at the site.  - Sub-canopy eddy fluxes (CO2, H2O, since 2023 also CH4).  - Continuous profile concentration and forest floor flux measurement of CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O.  - Auxiliary micrometeorology and soil climate measurements.    __Data availability__    Near real-time flux and meteo data uploaded daily to the ICOS Carbon Portal. Processed flux and meteo data are also available from the European Fluxes Database Cluster and part of Fluxnet2015 dataset.    __Data policy__    ICOS data license:   [https://www.icos-cp.eu/data-services/about-data-portal/data-license](https://www.icos-cp.eu/data-services/about-data-portal/data-license)    __Detailed site info__:   [https://www.swissfluxnet.ethz.ch/index.php/sites/ch-dav-davos/site-info-ch-dav/](https://www.swissfluxnet.ethz.ch/index.php/sites/ch-dav-davos/site-info-ch-dav/)",
