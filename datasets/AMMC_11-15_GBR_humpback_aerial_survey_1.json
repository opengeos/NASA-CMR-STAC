    "description": "This dataset is a collection of dedicated humpback whale sightings and effort from a double platform line transect aerial survey program conducted in the Great Barrier Reef. The survey was undertaken 3-10 August 2012 using a Partenavia Observer P-68B six-seater, twin engine, high-wing aircraft at a ground speed of 100 knots in passing mode at an altitude of 1000 ft. The survey was undertaken to coincide with peak humpback whale abundance within the breeding season, when it is assumed whales are utilising habitat important to their breeding behaviour and not engaging in migratory behaviour. For more details of the survey see:\n\nSmith, J. N., N. Kelly, and I. W. Renner. 2020.
