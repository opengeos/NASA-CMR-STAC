    "description": "A lack of young muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) and arctic hares (Lepus arcticus)\n      in the Eureka area of Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut),\n      Canada, was observed during summer 1998, in contrast to most other years since\n      1986.  Evidence of malnourished muskoxen was also found. Early winter weather\n      and a consequent 50% reduction of the 1997 summer replenishment period appeared\n      to be the most likely cause, giving rise to a new hypothesis about conditions\n      that might cause adverse demographic effects in arctic herbivores.\n      \n      The study area included a 150 km2 region of the Fosheim Peninsula in a 180o arc\n      north of Eureka, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada (all within about 9 km of\n      80oN, 86oW). The area, extending from Eureka Sound to Remus Creek and from\n      Slidre Fiord to Eastwind Lake, included shoreline, hills, lowlands, creek\n      bottoms, and the west side of Blacktop Ridge. An associate, Layne Adams, and I\n      spent 1-11 July 1998 in this area on all-terrain vehicles, following a pair of\n      wolves Canis lupus (Mech, 1994). Adams and I also surveyed the surrounding area\n      with binoculars for prey animals, in much the same manner that my assistants\n      and I have practiced for one to six weeks each summer in the same area since\n      1986 (Mech, 1995, 1997). Because both muskoxen and arctic hares were common\n      residents of the area during most years and were not the focus of our studies,\n      no standardized counts were made. However, general field notes were sufficient\n      to document that during most summers both species and their young were present.",
