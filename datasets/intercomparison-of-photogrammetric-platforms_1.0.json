    "description": "This data set contains the produced snow depth maps as well as the reference data set (manual and snow pole measurements) from our paper \"Intercomparison of photogrammetric platforms for spatially continuous snow depth mapping\".    __Abstract.__ Snow depth has traditionally been estimated based on point measurements collected either manually or at automated weather stations. Point measurements, though, do not represent the high spatial variability of snow depths present in alpine terrain. Photogrammetric mapping techniques have progressed in recent years and are capable of accurately mapping snow depth in a spatially continuous manner, over larger areas, and at various spatial resolutions. However, the strengths and weaknesses associated with specific platforms and photogrammetric techniques, as well as the accuracy of the photogrammetric performance on snow surfaces have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, industry-standard photogrammetric platforms, including high-resolution satellites (Pl\u00e9iades), airplane (Ultracam Eagle M3), Unmanned Aerial System (eBee+ with S.O.D.A. camera) and terrestrial (single lens reflex camera, Canon EOS 750D), were tested for snow depth mapping in the alpine Dischma valley (Switzerland) in spring 2018. Imagery was acquired with airborne and space-borne platforms over the entire valley, while Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and terrestrial photogrammetric imagery was acquired over a subset of the valley. For independent validation of the photogrammetric products, snow depth was measured by probing, as well as using remote observations of fixed snow poles.    When comparing snow depth maps with manual and snow pole measurements the root mean square error (RMSE) values and the normalized median deviation (NMAD) values were 0.52 m and 0.47 m respectively for the satellite snow depth map, 0.17 m and 0.17 m for the airplane snow depth map, 0.16 m and 0.11 m for the UAS snow depth map. The area covered by the terrestrial snow depth map only intersected with 4 manual measurements and did not generate statistically relevant measurements. When using the UAS snow depth map as a reference surface, the RMSE and NMAD values were 0.44 m and 0.38 m for the satellite snow depth map, 0.12 m and 0.11 m for the airplane snow depth map, 0.21 and 0.19 m for the terrestrial snow depth map. When compared to the airplane dataset over a large part of the Dischma valley (40 km2), the snow depth map from the satellite yielded a RMSE value of 0.92 m and a NMAD value of 0.65 m. This study provides comparative measurements between photogrammetric platforms to evaluate their specific advantages and disadvantages for operational, spatially continuous snow depth mapping in alpine terrain over both small and large geographic areas.",
