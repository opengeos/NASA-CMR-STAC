    "description": "The VNP43D85 Version 1 data product was decommissioned on July 31, 2025. Users are encouraged to use the\u00a0[VNP43D85](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43D85.002) and [VJ143D85](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VJ143D85.002) Version 2 data products.\n\nThe NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) for Band M7 (VNP43D85) is produced daily using 16 days of data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The VNP43D product suite is provided in a Climate Modeling Grid (CMG), which covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each VNP43D product contains just one data layer. \n\nVNP43D80 through VNP43D89 are the NBAR products of the VNP43D BRDF/Albedo product suite. NBAR values are provided for the nine VIIRS moderate resolution bands (M1 through M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11) included in the [VNP43MA4](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43MA4.001) product. In addition to the bands included in VNP43MA4, this product suite includes NBAR values for the VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB). The NBAR algorithm removes view angle effects from directional reflectances to model the values as if they were collected from a nadir view at local solar noon. Details regarding methodology are available on the [VNP43MA4](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43MA4.001) product page and in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\n\nVNP43D85 is the NBAR for VIIRS band M7 (0.865 \u03bcm). \n\nKnown Issues\n\n* The abnormally high activation of the high aerosol flag in the Collection 1 (C1) VNP09 product has impacted downstream products. The VNP43 BRDF/Albedo/NBAR product is affected by reducing the number of otherwise acceptable observations used as input to characterize surface anisotropy. This effect (most obvious over arid bright surfaces), results in a reduced number of high quality full BRDF model inversions. Therefore, users should be aware that bright arid surfaces (normally associated with high quality BRDF/Albedo/NBAR retrievals) are likely to be somewhat represented by lower quality results in C1. VNP09 has been corrected for Collection 2 (C2). Therefore, users should avoid substantive use of C1 VNP43 over arid regions (and wait for C2 products). In any event, users are **always strongly encouraged** to download and use the extensive QA data provided in VNP43[I-M]A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QA provided as part of the VNP43[I-M]A1, 3 and 4 products.\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=VIIRS).",
