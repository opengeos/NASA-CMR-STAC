    "description": "There are several ArcInfo coverages described by this metadata record - FRAME, GEOL, MAPGRID, SITES, STRLINE and STRUC (in that order). Each coverage is described below. The data is also provided as shapefiles and ArcInfo interchange files. \nThe data was used for the Mawson Escarpment Geology map published in 1998. This map is available from a URL provided in this metadata record. \n\nFRAME:\n\nThe coverage FRAME contains (arcs) and (polygon, label) and forms the limits of the data sets or map coverage of the MAWSON ESCARPMENT area of the AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC TERRITORY.\n\nThe purpose or intentions for this dataset is to form a cookie cutter for future data which may be aquired and require clipping to the map/data area.\n\nGEOL:\n\nThe coverage GEOL is historical geological data covering the MAWSON ESCARPMENT area.\n\nThe data were captured in ARC/INFO format and combined with geological outcrops that were accurately digitised over a March 1989 Landsat Thematic Mapper image at a scale of 1:100000.\nIt is not recomended that this data be used beyond this scale.\n\nThe coverage contains Arcs (lines) and polygons (polygon labels). These object are attributed as fully as possible in their .aat file for arcs and .pat for polygon labels and conform with the Geoscience Australia Geoscience Data Dictionary Version 98.04\n\nThe purpose or intentions for the dataset is that it become part of a greater geological database of the Australian Antarctic Territory.\n\n(1998-04-10 - 1998-06-30)\n\nMAPGRID:\n\nMAPGRID is a graticule that was generated as a 5 minute by 5 minute grid mainly to allow for good location/registration of source materials for digitising and adding some locational anno.mapgrat\n\nThis covers other function was to be used for a proof plot.\n\n(1998-04-22 - 1998-06-30)\n\nSITES:\n\nThe purpose or intentions for this dataset is to provide the approximate location of this historic data on sample sites in the MAWSON ESCARPMENT region of the AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC TERRITORY, for future expansion or more accurate positioning when improved records of location are found.\n\n(1998-05-11 - 1998-06-30)\n\nSTRLINE:\n\nThis Structural lines for geology coverage is named (STRLINE).\n\nThe purpose or intentions for the dataset is to have the linear structural features in their own coverage containing only structure which does not form polygon boundaries.\n\n(1998-05-28 - 1998-06-30)\n\nSTRUC:\n\nThis coverage called STRUC for structural measurements is a point coverage. It can be described as Mesoscopic structures at a site or outcrop.\n\nThe purpose or intentions for the dataset is to provide all the known structural point data information in the one coverage.\n\n(1998-05-28 - 1998-06-30)",
