    "description": "The Digital Surface Model (DSM) was created by Dr Arko Lucieer of TerraLuma (http://www.terraluma.net/) and the University of Tasmania for the Terrestrial and Nearshore Ecosystems research group at the Australian Antarctic Division (TNE/AAD).\nThe resolution of the DSM is 2 cm.\nAlso included are layers derive from the DSM: hillshade, slope and 20 cm interval contours.\nAn orthophoto was also created. See the metadata record 'Orthophoto of an area at Old Casey, derived from aerial photographs taken with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), 5 February 2014' with ID 'oldcasey_ortho_2014'.\n\nThe products were requested for Australian Antarctic Science Project 4036: \nRemediation of petroleum contaminants in the Antarctic and subantarctic.\nThey cover the drainage area from a fuel spill at Old Casey that occurred in \n1982.\nThe products were created from digital photos taken on the 5th February, 2014, with a UAV piloted by Dr Zybnek Malenovsky. \nThe products were georeferenced to ground control points surveyed using differential GPS by Dr Daniel Wilkins of TNE/AAD.\nHorizontal Datum: ITRF2000.",
