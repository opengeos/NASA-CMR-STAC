    "description": "This dataset contains estimates of tree canopy cover presence at high resolution (0.5m) across the state of Vermont for 2016 in Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (*.tif) format. Tree canopy was derived from 2016 high-resolution remotely sensed data as part of the Vermont High-Resolution Land Cover mapping project. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract potential tree canopy and trees using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to ensure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:3000 and all observable errors were corrected. Tree canopy assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establish tree canopy goals.",
