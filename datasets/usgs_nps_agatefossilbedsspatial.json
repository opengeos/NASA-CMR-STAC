    "description": "The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction with the Biological Resources\nDivision (BRD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has implemented a program\nto \"develop a uniform hierarchical vegetation methodology\" at a national level.\nThe program will also create a geographic information system (GIS) database for\nthe parks under its management. The purpose of the data is to document the\nstate of vegetation within the NPS service area during the 1990's, thereby\nproviding a baseline study for further analysis at the Regional or Service-wide\nlevel. The vegetation units of this map were determined through stereoscopic\ninterpretation of aerial photographs supported by field sampling and ecological\nanalysis. The vegetation boundaries were identified on the photographs by means\nof the photographic signatures and collateral information on slope, hydrology,\ngeography, and vegetation in accordance with the Standardized National\nVegetation Classification System (October 1995). The mapped vegetation reflects\nconditions that existed during the specific year and season that the aerial\nphotographs were taken (July, 1995). There is an inherent margin of error in\nthe use of aerial photography for vegetation delineation and classification.\n\nThe purpose of this spatial data is to provide the National Park Service the\nnecessary tools to manage the natural resources within this park system.\nSeveral parks, representing different regions, environmental conditions, and\nvegetation types, were chosen by BRD to be part of the prototype phase of the\nprogram. The initial goal of the prototype phase is to \"develop, test, refine,\nand finalize the standards and protocols\" to be used during the production\nphase of the project. This includes the development of a standardized\nvegetation classification system for each park and the establishment of\nphotointerpretation, field, and accuracy assessment procedures. Agate Fossil\nBeds National Monument was designated as one of the prototype parks. The\nmonument is located in the high Great Plains. It contains prairie, hill, and\nriverine environments, with vegetation types that include prairie grassland,\nriverine woodland, and wetlands. The vegetation units were photointerpreted\nfrom stereo-paired, natural color photography.\n\nAgate Fossil Beds National Monument was created by the National Park Service on\nJune 5, 1965. The park occupies 4.5 square miles of land straddling the\nNiobrara River in the middle of the Nebraska Panhandle. The park is noted for\nits history, prehistoric fossils, and scenic quality. Historically, the park\nwas a part of the Agate Springs Ranch, owned by Captain James H. Cook. The park\nhas a collection of ranching and Native American artifacts and memorabilia as a\nresult of its donation from the Ranch. Paleontologically, the park contains a\nnumber of Miocene fossil quarries that were excavated through the late 19th\ncentury and early 20th century. From a scenic aspect, the park has views of\nrolling hills, bluffs, and the Niobrara River floodplain. Ranching is also an\nactive part of the landscape. The park is located in the grassy rolling hills\nof Western Nebraska. The park landscape consists of the east-west trending\ncap-rocked northern and southern hills, with the treeless Niobrara River\nfloodplain running down the middle of the valley. The city of Harrison is\nlocated 23 miles to the north, Mitchell is 34 miles to the south. State Highway\n29 runs north-south through the western part of the park.\n\n The Vegetation mapping was conducted in Agate Fossil Beds National Moument,\nNebraska with a 400 meter buffer.\n\nA total of 39 plots were obtained from July 10 through August 15, 1995. These\nplots were used by TNC to describe the vegetation associations found within the\npark. These descriptions are in the companion report by TNC. Map Validation A\nfield trip was conducted in August of 1997 to assess the initial mapping effort\nand to refine map class.\n\nInformation for this metadata was taken from\n\"http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/agfo/metaagfospatial.html\" and converted to the\nNASA Directory Interchange Format.\n\nAnother site to obtain the data is located at \nOnline_Resource: \"ftp://ftp.cbi.usgs.gov/pub/vegmapping/agfo/agfo.exe\".",
