    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 1342\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nThis project involves field trialling of software written as part of ASAC project 1212 (2000-2001) to determine sea-ice thickness in real-time from ship-borne electromagnetic induction measurements.  Computer simulation of ship- and helicopter-borne electromagnetic induction measurements over realistic sea-ice structures will also be performed in order to assess the suitability and cost-effectiveness of helicopter-mounted systems for future Antarctic sea-ice thickness measurements.\n\nEquipment used in this study were the IBEO PS100 infrared laser altimeter and the Geonics EM31 geophysical electromagnetic induction device.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nDAY is Julian day\nTIME is in seconds after midnight (UTC).\nLASER is the laser altitude above the snow/ice (metres). A zero reading\nindicates no return (open water).\nPITCH is pitch of the system in degrees.\nROLL is roll of the system in degrees.\nCOND-A is analogue conductivity from the EM31 (not used).\nPHASE-A is analogue in-phase response from the EM31 (not used).\nCOND is the estimated depth to seawater (metres) from the EM31-ICE processing module.\nPHASE is the EM31 in-phase response (expressed as parts per thousand of the primary field). A value of 9.99 indicates the magnetic field was too large to be recorded.\nSITE\nLATITUDE\nLONGITUDE\nSNOW THICKNESS\nICE THICKNESS\nFREEBOARD\na is the electrode spacing.\nR is the measured resistance.\nRho is the apparent conductivity (not true conductivity) = 2 aR.\nCONDUCTIVITY = 1/Rho.",
