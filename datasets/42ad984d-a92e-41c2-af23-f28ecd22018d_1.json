    "description": "The African Cities Population Database (ACPD) has been produced by the\nBirkbeck College of the University of London in 1990 at the request of\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe database contains head counts for 479 cities in Africa which either\nhave a population of over 20,000 or are capitals of their nation state.\nListed are the geographical location of the cities and their population\nsizes.  The material is primarily derived from a 1988 report of the\nEconomic Commission for Africa (ECA) and several issues of the United\nNations Demographic Yearbook (1973-81). Severe problems were found with\nseveral countries such as Togo, Ghana and South Africa.  For South Africa,\nthe data were derived from the United Nations Demographic Yearbook 1987.\n \nWCPD is an Arc/Info point coverage.  It has no projection, as the cities\nare located on the basis of their latitude and longitude.  Coordinates\nwere assigned on the basis of gazetteers or African maps.  Each record\nin the data base contains details of the city name, country name,\nlatitude and longitude of the city, and its population at a defined\ntime.  The Arc/Info attribute table contains the following fields:\n \nAREA       Arc/Info item\nPERIMETER  Arc/Info item\nACPD#      Arc/Info item\nACPD-ID    Arc/Info item\nID-NUM     Unique number for each city\nCITY       City name\nCOUNTRY    Country name\nCITY-POP   Population of city proper\nYEAR       Latest available year of collection\n \nACPD comes as an Arc/Info EXPORT file originally called \"ACPD.E00\" and \ncontains 67 Kb of data.  The file has a record length of 80 and a block\nsize of 8000 (blocking factor = 100).  The file can be read from tape\nusing Arc/Info's TAPEREAD command or any other generic copy utility. \nIf distributed on a diskette it can be read using the ordinary DOS 'COPY'\ncommand.  The file has to be converted to Arc/Info internal format using\nits IMPORT command.\n \nReferences to the WCPD data set can be found in:\n \n - SERLL News, Issue No. 1, January 1991, Birkbeck College, London, UK.\n - D. Rhind.  \"Cartographically-related research at Birkbeck College\n   1987-91\" in: The Cartographic Journal, Vol. 28, June 1991, pp. 63-66.\n \nThe source of the WCPD data set as held by GRID is Birkbeck College,\nUniversity of London, Department of Geography, London, UK.",
