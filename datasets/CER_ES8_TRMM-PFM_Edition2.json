    "description": "CER_ES8_TRMM-PFM_Edition2 is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)-like Instantaneous Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Estimates Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) proto flight model (PFM) Edition 2 data product. The CERES-PFM instrument collected data for this product on the TRMM platform. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nCERES ES-8 data product contains a 24-hour, single-satellite, instantaneous view of scanner fluxes at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reduced from spacecraft altitude unfiltered radiances using ERBE scanner Inversion algorithms and the ERBE shortwave (SW) and long-wave (LW) Angular Distribution Models (ADMs). The ES-8 data include the total (TOT), SW, LW, and window (WN) channel radiometric data; SW, LW, and WN unfiltered radiance values; and the ERBE scene identification for each measurement. These data are organized according to the CERES 3.3-second scan into 6.6-second records. As long as there was one valid scanner measurement within a record, the ES-8 record was generated. \r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful ERBE mission. The first CERES instrument, PFM, was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the TRMM. Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit onboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched onboard Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched onboard the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
