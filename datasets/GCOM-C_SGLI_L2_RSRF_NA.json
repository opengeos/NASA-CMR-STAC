    "description": "GCOM-C/SGLI L2 Land atmospheric corrected reflectance is obtained from the SGLI sensor onboard GCOM-C and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GCOM-C is Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent orbit satellite launched on December 23, 2017 and conducts long-term global observations of geophysical variables related to the global climate system across 28 items including aerosol and vegetation over 4 areas of atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere. The data will be used to contribute to higher accuracy of global warming prediction. The SGLI has swath of 1150 km in the visible band and 1400 km in the infrared band. Level 2 products are defined to be granule scene and global (tile) data of physical quantity derived from Level-1B or Level-2 products and ancillary data such as meteorological data and various additional data related to the physical quantity.  The product is the atmospherically corrected reflectance equivalent to that of the land surface removing the effect of scattering/absorption of light caused by gas molecules and aerosol particles in the atmosphere. BRDF is not corrected in the daily product. This dataset includes surface reflectance of each bands (Rs_SW01-04, Rs_VN01-Rs_VN11, Rs_PI01-02), TOA brightness temperature of TI01 and TI02 sensors (Tb_TI01, 02), daily mean of shortwave radiation (SWR) , daily photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), particle optical thickness at 500 nm (Tau_500), angstrom exponent of particles (Angstrom), observation geometries, Land water flag, and quality flag. Rs_VN01-11, Rs_VN08P, Rs_VN11P, Rs_SW_01-04, PI01-02 are surface reflectance of the SGLI channels. PI01 and PI02 are I components of the Stokes vector. VN08P and VN11P are Surface reflectance of co-registered for PI01 and PI02 respectively. The physical quantity unit is dimensionless. Tb_TI01, 02 is TOA brightness temperature of TI01 and TI02 sensors. The physical quantity unit is Kelvin.SWR is Daily mean of shortwave radiation in W/m^2.PAR is Daily Photosynthetically Active Radiation in Ein/m^2/day.Tau_500 is particle optical thickness at 500 nm.Angstrom is Angstrom exponent of particles. The physical quantity unit is dimensionless.Satellite/solar zenith/azimuth angles, and observation time from LTOA, in degree.Land_water_flag is Land water flag from LTOA.QA_flag is quality flag indicating the observation condition. Bit-14 (non-polarization) and 15 (polarization) of QA_flag are set when the grid is recovered by the pre-day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BRDF table. Available data on the target day can be identified by selecting the pixel of the Bit-14 (15 for the polarization channels)=0. The provided format is HDF5. The Spatial resolution of Rs_PI01, Rs_PI02, Rs_SW02, Rs_SW04, Rs_VN08P and Rs_VN11P are 1 km. Others are 250 m. The projection method is EQA. The data projection type is \"Tile\".  The current version of the product is Version 3. The Version 2 is also available.",
