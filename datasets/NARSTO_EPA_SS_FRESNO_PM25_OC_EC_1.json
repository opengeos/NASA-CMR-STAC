    "description": "NARSTO_EPA_SS_FRESNO_PM25_OC_EC is the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Supersite (SS) Fresno, Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 Organic and Elemental Carbon Data. This data set contains measurements taken from a continuous carbon monitor, Model Rupprecht and Patashnick (R&P) 5400C operated from January 13, 2000 to March 31, 2005, and a Sunset Carbon Analyzer at the Fresno supersite. The sample collection time was 1 hour; the sample analysis time was one hour. Data were output once an hour, two hours after the start of sample collection. \r\n\r\nThe Fresno Supersite is one of several Supersites established in urban areas within the United States by the EPA to better understand the measurement, sources, and health effects of suspended particulate matter (PM). The site is located at 3425 First Street, approximately 1 km north of the downtown commercial district. First Street was a four-lane artery with moderate traffic levels. Commercial establishments, office buildings, churches, and schools were located north and south of the monitor. Medium-density single-family homes and some apartments were located in the blocks to the east and west of First Street. The Fresno Supersite began operation in May of 1999.The EPA PM Supersites Program was an ambient air monitoring research program designed to provide information of value to the atmospheric sciences, and human health and exposure research communities. \r\n\r\nEight geographically diverse projects were chosen to specifically address the following EPA research priorities: (1) to characterize PM, its constituents, precursors, co-pollutants, atmospheric transport, and its source categories that affect the PM in any region; (2) to address the research questions and scientific uncertainties about PM source-receptor and exposure-health effects relationships; and (3) to compare and evaluate different methods of characterizing PM including testing new and emerging measurement methods.\r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
