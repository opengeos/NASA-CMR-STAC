    "description": "The MYD14A2.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nMODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products are primarily derived from MODIS 4- and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are employed to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline.\r\n\r\nMYD14A2 data are 8-day fire-mask composites at 1-kilometer resolution provided as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Science Data Sets include the fire-mask and algorithm quality.\r\n\r\nThe Aqua MODIS instrument acquires data twice daily (1:30 PM and AM), as does the Terra MODIS (10:30 AM and PM). These four daily MODIS fire observations serve to advance global monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS Thermal Anomalies & Fire products have attained Validation Stage 3, which was completed using active fire reference data that were derived from ASTER and Landsat-5 TM (30 m resolution) data sources.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~0.4 MB \r\nResolution: ~1000 meters \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 2\r\nTemporal Extent: 2002-07-04 to 2017-03-30",
