    "description": "The Australian Antarctic Division acquired aerial photographs of sea ice from helicopters using a digital Nikon D1X digital camera during the voyage, Alfred Wegener Institute Ice Station Polarstern (ISPOL) voyage 2004/05, 6 Nov 2004 to 19 Jan 2005.\n    \nFlights were conducted around the edges of a triangular array of drifting buoys each transmitting GPS location. Flights throughout the experiment show changes in the surface properties (floe size, extent of surface flooding) with time.\n\nSee the metadata record 'AAD buoy data collected during ISPOL 2004, Western Weddell Sea' for more information on the ISPOL project.\n\nThe Related URLs in this metadata record include the urls of web pages with information about the voyage, urls for requesting for the photographs and urls for downloading information about the photographs.\n\nThe ISPOL aerial photographs of sea ice are part of the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's collection of aerial photographs which is described by the metadata record 'The collection of aerial photographs held by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre' with Entry ID: aerial_photo_gis.\n\nThe collection can be searched in the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's Aerial Photograph Catalogue - see Related URLs. \n\nSelect ISPOL from the Aerial Photography Series picklist.\n\nPreview images of the photos may be viewed using this search.\n\nDigital flight lines and photo centres representing the runs along which the photographs were taken and the centres of the photographs are the basis of the catalogue.\n\nThe flight lines and photo centres for ISPOL are available for download as shapefiles - see metadata record ID: aerial_photo_sea_ice_shapefiles.\n",
