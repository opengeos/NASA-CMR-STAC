    "description": "Three experiments were performed at Davis Station, East Antarctica 77 degrees 58' E, 68 degrees 35' S to determine the effects of ocean acidification on natural assemblages of Antarctica marine microbes (bacteria, viruses, phytoplankton and protozoa). Incubation tanks (minicosms) were filled on the 30/12/08, 20/01/09 and 09/02/09 with sea water that was filtered through 200 microns mesh to remove metazoan grazers. The pH of the contents of each tank was then adjusted by adding calculated amounts to CO2 saturated sea water to achieve and maintain CO2 concenrtations that encompassed atmospheric concenrtations from pre-industrial to post-2100.  As 6 tanks were available the 3 x current CO2 treatment was duplicated to indicate the variance among replicate tanks. Instead, responses were analysed to determine trends among concentrations. The microbial communities were incubated for 10, 12 and 10 days, in experiments 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Chemical and biological parameters were measured every second day to determine concentrations of macronutrients, particulate and dissolved organic carbon, pigment composition, dissolved oxygen, concentrations of phytoplankton, protozoa, bacteria (and viruses) using flow cytometry, light and electron microscopy, lipids, rates of primary, bacterial production and microzooplankton grazing.\n    \nThese data have been collected as part of ASAC project 40 (ASAC_40), and Terrestrial Nearshore Ecosystems project 8A.\n\nThe excel spreadsheet contains:\n\nSeparate sheets reporting the results from each of the 3 experiments run at Davis Station in the 2008/09 summer. \nAbbreviations are as follows:\n\nNutrients: NO3 =nitrate, PO4 = Phosphate, Si = silicate\n\nPrimary production and respiration were determined from oxygen microelectrodes: net photosynthesis from oxygen increase during exposure to light and respiration determined from net decrease in oxygen in the absence of light.\n\nPhotosynthetic parameters were also measure using 14C bicarbonate as a trace for Carbon uptake, these being: maximum photosynthetic rate) Pmax, Photosynthetic efficiency (Alpha) and saturating light intensity (Ek).\n\nFlow cytometry was used to count 7 microbial parameters: pico phytoplankton (Picos) nanophytoplankton in two regions (Nano R2 and Nano R3).\n\nCryptophytes, high DNA bacteria (HDNA_bact) and low DNA bacteria (LDNA_bact).\n\nMicroscope cell counts identified a range of taxa/groups that comprised greater than 1% of the total phytoplankton abundance: unidentified nanoplankton (UNAN), small pennate diatoms (Pennate less than 10 microns)  and other taxa as specified.\n\nOrganic material measurements including: Particulate organic carbon (POC), Particulate organic nitrogen (PON) particulate carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N), Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)\n\nIntermittent measurements were also made of rates of herbivory and bacterivory and rates of phytoplankton and bacterial growth in 3 of the 6 tanks.\n\nPhotosynthetic pigments were measured and are given only for experiment 1 so far (other to come later): Beta-Beta carotene (BB carotene), Chlorophylls c1 (Chl c1), c2 (Chl c2), c3 Chl c3), a (Chl a), b (Chl b), Chlorophyllide a (Chlidea), diadinoxanthin (Ddx), Diatoxanthin (dtx), Chl a epimer (epi), Fucoxanthin (Fuc), 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxathin (Hex), Methyl Chlorophyllide a (MeChlidea), Magnesium divinyl  pheaoporphyrin monomethyl ester (MgDVP), Phaeophytin (Phaeo), Violaxanthin (viola) and total pigment concentration. CHEMTAX will also be performed using these pigments to study CO2-induced changes in phytoplankton community structure.",
