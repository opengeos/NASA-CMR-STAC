    "description": "The scientific focus of this project is to examine the complex interactions (synergistic and antagonistic) of contaminants (externally derived nutrients, mercury, sulfur, pesticides, herbicides, polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and other metals), ecosystem responses to variations in contaminant loading (time and space dimensions), and how imminent ecosystem restoration steps may affect existing contaminant pools.\nThe major objectives of this project are to use an integrated biogeochemical approach to examine: (1) anthropogenic-induced changes in the water chemistry of the Everglades ecosystem, (2) biogeochemical processes within the ecosystem affecting water chemistry, and (3) the predicted impacts of restoration efforts on water chemistry. The project uses a combination of field investigations, experimental approaches (mesocosm experiments in the ecosystem, and controlled laboratory experiments), and modeling to achieve these objectives. Contaminants of concern will include nutrients, sulfur, mercury, organic compounds, and other metals. Protocols for the collection of samples and chemical analyses developed during earlier studies will be employed in these efforts. Integration of the individual tasks within the project is achieved by colocation of field sampling sites, and cooperative planning and execution of laboratory and mesocosm experiments.\n\nData available for this project include dissolved sulfate and solid sulfur geochemistry and surface and pore water chemistry.",
