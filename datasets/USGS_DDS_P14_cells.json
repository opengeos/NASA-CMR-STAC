    "description": "The purpose of the cell map is to display the exploration maturity,\ntype of production, and distribution of production in quarter-mile\ncells in each of the oil and gas plays and each of the provinces\ndefined for the 1995 U.S. National Oil and Gas Assessment.\n\nCell maps for each oil and gas play were created by the USGS as a\nmethod for illustrating the degree of exploration, type of production,\nand distribution of production in a play or province. Each cell\nrepresents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells\nare coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are\npredominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and\ngas-producing, or dry. The well information was initially retrieved\nfrom the Petroleum Information (PI) Well History Control System\n(WHCS), which is a proprietary, commercial database containing\ninformation for most oil and gas wells in the U.S.  Cells were\ndeveloped as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying\nproprietary WHCS data. No proprietary data are displayed or included\nin the cell maps. The data from WHCS were current as of December 1990\nwhen the cell maps were created in 1994.\n\nOil and gas plays within province 14 (Los Angeles Basin) are listed\nhere by play number, type, and name:\n\n    Number  Type           Name\n    1401  conventional   Santa Monica Fault System and Las Cienegas\n                         Fault and Block\n    1402  conventional   Southwestern Shelf and Adjacent Offshore\n                         State Lands\n    1403  conventional   Newport-Inglewood Deformation Zone and\n                         Southwestern Flank of Central Syncline\n    1404  conventional   Whittier Fault Zone and Fullerton Embayment\n    1405  conventional   Northern Shelf and Northern Flank of\n                         Central Syncline\n    1406  conventional   Anaheim Nose\n    1407  conventional   Chino Marginal Basin, Puente and San Jose\n                         Hills, and San Gabriel Valley Marginal Basin",
