    "description": "The Lambert Glacier Basin Traverse program ran from the summer of 1989-90 to the summer of 1994-95. The aim of the program was to take multi-year measurements on the dynamics of the ice-sheet draining into the Lambert Glacier, from around the 2500m ice surface elevation contour. These measurements were then used in mass balance calculations for the whole Lambert-Amery system.\n\nAnnual reports were written during this program, detailing the activities and science carried out, equipment and personnel used, travel logs, fuel consumption, and problems encountered. These reports have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.",
