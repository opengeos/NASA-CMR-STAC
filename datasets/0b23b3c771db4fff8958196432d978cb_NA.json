    "description": "This dataset contains ice velocities for the Greenland margin for winter 1995-1996, which have been produced by the ESA Greenland Ice Sheet Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project.  The data were derived from intensity-tracking of ERS-2 data acquired between 03-09-1995 and 29-03-1996. It provides components of the ice velocity and the magnitude of the velocity.The data are provided on a polar stereographic grid (EPSG3413: Latitude of true scale 70N, Reference Longitude 45E).  The horizontal velocity is provided in true meters per day, towards the EASTING(x) and NORTHING(y) directions of the grid;  the vertical displacement (z), derived from a digital elevation model, is also provided.  Please note that previous versions of this product provided the horizontal velocities as true East and North velocities.Both a single NetCDF file (including all measurements and annotation), and separate geotiff files with the velocity components are provided.  The product was generated by DTU Space - Microwaves and Remote Sensing.  For further information please see the product user guide.Please note - this product was released on the Greenland Ice Sheets download page in June 2016, but an earlier product (also accidentally labelled v1.1) was available through the CCI Open Data Portal and the CEDA archive until 29th November 2016. Please now use the later v1.1 product.",
