    "description": "This award provides funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate students and early career researchers for the 2019 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) Polar Marine Science meetings to be held in Ventura, CA May 22-28, 2021. The 2021 GRC event is entitled --Integrating Ocean Physics and Biogeochemistry to Assess Polar Ecosystem Sensitivity to Rapid Change--. Gordon conferences on this topic are held every two years and provide a key forum to discuss cutting-edge and cross-disciplinary marine research highlighted as an international priority topic. The conference plan is designed to provide powerful insights into the present and future states of polar marine ecosystems, including the local and regional aspects of ocean circulation, sea ice dynamics, biogeochemical fluxes, biodiversity, ecosystem health and human well-being. \n.\nThis event will bring together an interdisciplinary group of students and young researchers from many fields working in Polar regions. Exchanges of this type are essential for ensuring that U.S. scientists and engineers maintain international research leadership in in polar regions. Participants will have an opportunity to present their work in the form of oral presentations or posters while interacting with some of the most eminent researchers in the field. The GRS and GRC will address fundamental aspects, which are related to the grand environmental and sustainability challenges facing mankind. Specific emphasis will be given to defining the next generation challenges in polar region research. The unique format of the Gordon Research Conferences with invited talks, limited attendance, and ample time for interactions will provide early career scientists with ample opportunities for discussions and networking. Particular emphasis will be placed on encouraging student and post-doc participation from a broad range of institutions. The GRC-PPS will be widely advertised in the community and the participation and application for travel support by junior scientists will be strongly encouraged.  \n.\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
