    "description": "Bacteria were isolated at 4 degrees C, with oil as their sole carbon and energy source, from the soils collected at the locations below.\nMany of the bacteria will be identified using 16S rRNA analysis, as well as by tradational taxonomic methods.\nThe degradation pathways and the genes involved in the bioremediation of oil will be determined for these bacteria.\nThis can potentially be used to speed up the rate of bioremediation at low temperatures.\nThe differences in the community structures between oil-contaminated and pristine sites around the Windmill Islands will also be determined.\n\n2005-05-30\nUnfortunately all samples were lost when an incubator malfunctioned.  No data were collected from this project.",
