    "description": "The Africa Irrigation Potential data set, which represents the best\n      soils suitable for upland, is part of the FAO Irrigation and Water\n      Resources Potential Database. The main input maps were the 1977\n      FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the Africa, UNESCO Geological World Atlas\n      (scale 1:10 m), Mean Annual Rainfall map from hand drawn FAO/AGS\n      climate maps, Template with water related features, Administrative\n      Units map, and Watersheds map.  All maps, apart from where specified\n      were at a scale of 1:5 million, and all in Miller Oblated\n      Stereographic projection.\n      \nThe soil suitability for irrigation was determined by evaluating the\n      properties of all soil components: dominant soil, associations and\n      inclusions, phases, slope, drainage, and texture.  The classification\n      was done for two major crop types: lowland crops (flooded rice), and\n      upland crops (for all other irrigated crops except the lowland crops).\n      \n      The soils source includes a list of attributes for each soil unit\n      including: slope, drainage, texture and phase (re: UNEP/FAO/ESRI ITU\n      100004). Then for both cases (lowland crops (flooded rice), and upland\n      crops (for all other irrigated crops except the lowland crops)), two\n      maps were generated. One with all soils which are suitable, and one\n      where slope, texture, drainage and phase were considered.\n      \n      Each different soil type is classed according to suitability, S1\n      irrigation with no constraints, S2 irrigation with some constraints,\n      N1 not suitable without major improvements, N2 permanently not\n      suitable.  Because one soil unit can consist of more soil components\n      (unit Af26-a can mean 30%Bf and 70% Af) the suitability is expressed\n      in percentage of the unit that is suitable (1 >50% suitable, 2 =\n      25-50% etc.).  Then the soil characteristics are used to refine the\n      ranking. This refining is done were the original soil rank is\n      increased decreased or changed from their original suitability to a\n      new suitability (so or soil gets new class S1, N1 etc.  or ranking\n      changes like, -1 lower soil rank by one, +1 raise soil rank with one).\n      \n      The Ranking of Soils is as follows\n      The soils  considered not suitable are:\n      \n      Lithosols, Arenosols, Rendzinas, Yermosols, Podzols, Thionic\n      Fluvisols,\n      \n      Miscellaneous land units such as rock debris, desert debris,\n      \n      Gypsum units,\n      \n      Soils with stonic, lythic or petrogypsic phase.",
