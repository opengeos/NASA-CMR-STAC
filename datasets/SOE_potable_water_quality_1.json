Any contamination may be from either natural or human impacts, but analysis provides a useful indicator for further examination of causes, and a long term record of natural water quality around human settlements.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\n\nWater is obtained from a number of sources dependent upon the station: from desalination plants, melt bells, natural melt lakes and natural streams.\n\nPotable water quality is measured monthly at storage water tanks and various tap outlets around stations - mostly at the main living, sleeping and medical quarters.\n\nSpatial Scale: Australian Antarctic stations: Australian Antarctic continental stations and Macquarie Island station.\n\nFrequency: Monthly\n\nMeasurement Technique: Test is conducted by either the Station Medical Officer or the Station Plumber for the following parameters: pH, conductivity, turbidity and faecal coliforms.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\n\nTesting is used primarily to determine health of potable water for consumption.  However testing may show either natural or human impacts in the natural catchments of water sources.  Test results that show unusual contaminant levels leads to investigation of causes, whether in the station infrastructure or natural water catchments.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\n\nSOE Indicator 48 - Station and ship person days\nSOE Indicator 50 - Volume of wastewater discharged from Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 51 - Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) of wastewater discharged from Australian Antarctic Stations\nSOE Indicator 52 - Suspended solids (SS) content of wastewater discharged from Australian Antarctic Stations",
