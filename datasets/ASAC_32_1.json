    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 32\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\nFrom the abstract of the referenced paper:\n\nFoods of the South Polar Skua in the eastern Larsemann Hills:\n\nRegurgitated pellets and food remains were collected near nest sites, and from a club site, of south polar skuas Catharacta maccormicki in the eastern Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica, during the skuas' presence in the area. The samples indicated that the snow petrel Pagodroma nivea, the most abundant seabird species breeding locally, formed the major dietary component, comprising some 66% of food items identified in pellets and 80% of the food remains obtained.  Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae (which do not breed in the Larsemann Hills), other seabirds, fish and marine foods were rarely found as remains or in pellets.  However, refuse (meat, fish and vegetable remains) taken as food by skuas from nearby stations occurred in pellets at all sites and formed about 12% of the food remains collected and identified.  In this study, foods taken by skuas were related both to the local breeding distribution of snow petrels, and to the possession of a feeding territory. Birds without feeding territories took somewhat fewer snow petrels and included more refuse from local stations in their diet, as did those at the club site.  Future monitoring of the influence of anthropogenic foods (and indelible waste materials) on the species' ecology is considered important.",
