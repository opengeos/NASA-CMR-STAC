    "description": "To determine subglacial topography and internal features of the Fourcade Glacier on King George Island in\r\nAntarctica, helicopter-borne and ground-towed ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data were recorded along four profiles in\r\nNovember 2006. Signature deconvolution, f-k migration velocity analysis, and finite-difference depth migration applied to the\r\nmixed-phase, single-channel, ground-towed data, were effective in increasing vertical resolution, obtaining the velocity\r\nfunction, and yielding clear depth images, respectively. For the helicopter-borne GPR, migration velocities were obtained as\r\nroot-mean-squared velocities in a two-layer model of air and ice. The radar sections show rugged subglacial topography,\r\nenglacial sliding surfaces, and localised scattering noise. The maximum depth to the basement is over 79m in the subglacial\r\nvalley adjacent to the south-eastern slope of the divide ridge between Fourcade and Moczydlowski Glaciers.\nIn the groundtowed\r\nprofile,weinterpret a complicated conduit above possible basal water and other isolated cavities, which are a few metres\r\nwide. Near the terminus, the GPR profiles image sliding surfaces, fractures, and faults that will contribute to the tidewater\r\ncalving mechanism forming icebergs in Potter Cove.",
