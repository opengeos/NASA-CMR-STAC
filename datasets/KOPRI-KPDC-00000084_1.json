    "description": "In order to investigate the structure of phytoplankton communities, this study was carried out at 14 stations from July 24 to August 26, 2007 in the Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea. Phytoplankton communities were composed of 57 taxa representing Dinophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Dictyochophyceae, rasinophyceae, Prymneosiophyceae and unidentified phytoplankton(< 20\u339b) in the study area. Phytoplankton standing crops ranged from minimum 4.31\u00d7105cells \u2113-1 at station B04 to maximum 3.47\u00d7106cells \u2113-1 at station B04 in the Bering Sea. and 5.43\u00d7105cells \u2113-1 at station C09 to maximum 2.42\u00d7106cells \u2113-1 at station C16 in the Chukchi Sea. The most abundant species was nano-pico sized phytoplankton in almost station, but the second was variable. Phytoplankton dominant species were Thalassiosira sp., Chaetoceros sp. and nano-picophytoplankton such as Dinobryon belgica. In the Bering strait, the diversity was higher than other study area but cell abundance was not enough of a difference.\n1) To investigate on species composition, abundance and dominant species of phytoplankton communities in the Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea\r\n2) To study on taxonomic research and dominant species of phytoplankton communities for investigate on indicator species",
