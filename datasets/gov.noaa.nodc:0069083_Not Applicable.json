    "description": "Chemical, physical and profile oceanographic data were collected aboard NOAA Ship THOMAS JEFFERSON in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-06-15 to 2010-06-28 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include CDOM fluorescence, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, hydrostatic pressure, salinity, sound velocity, temperature and water density. The instruments used to collect these data included CTD, fluorometer and oxygen meter along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. The CTD data underwent preliminary quality assurance and control procedures at the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC). Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers.
