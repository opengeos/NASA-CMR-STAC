    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance Daily Global 0.05 Degree Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) Version 1 product (VNP43C4) is derived from the 30 arc second CMG VNP43D Version 1 product suite. VNP43C3 is generated daily from all available high-quality reflectance data over a 16-day moving window emphasizing the ninth day of the retrieval period, which is reflected in the Julian date in the filename. The VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from VNP43C1 to compute NBAR values for the VIIRS Day/Night band (DNB), and moderate resolution bands M1 through M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11. The algorithm removes view angle effects from directional reflectances to model the values as if they were collected from a nadir view at local solar noon. The quality and inversion status of the majority of the underlying 30 arc second pixels is provided as well as the percentage of the underlying pixels that were present or were snow covered. Users are encouraged to assess the quality information before using the BRDF/Albedo data. This 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the equator) CMG product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. \r\n\r\nThe VNP43C3 product includes 10 layers containing NBAR values for VIIRS DNB and moderate resolution bands M1 through M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11. Along with the NBAR data for the 10 bands are five ancillary layers for uncertainty, quality, local solar noon, percent finer resolution inputs, and snow cover. A low-resolution browse image is also available showing NBAR bands M5, M4, and M3 as a red, green, blue (RGB) image in JPEG format.\r\n",
