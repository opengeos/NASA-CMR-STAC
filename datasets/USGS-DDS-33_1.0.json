    "description": "The Upper Cretaceous Sussex \"B\" sandstone was deposited as a probable\ntransgressive-marine sand-ridge complex in a mid-shelf position. The \"B\"\nsandstone is bounded by upper and basal disconformities and encased in\nmudstones and low-porosity and low-permeability sandstones of the Cody Shale.\nReservoir characteristics are controlled primarily by depositional and\ndiagenetic heterogeneity at megascopic (field), macroscopic (well), and\nmicroscopic (rock sample) levels. To simplify, this means production of oil is\ncontrolled by stacking and interbedding of sandstone and mudstone beds and by\ngeochemical changes through time that affect flow of fluids through the rock.\n\nMore than 24.8 million barrels of oil (MMBO) have been produced from the Sussex\n\"B\" sandstone in the House Creek field, Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Greatest\noil production, porosity, and permeability, the thickest reservoir sandstone\nintervals, and best lateral continuity of the primary reservoir facies are all\nlocated parallel and proximal to field axes. Decrease in reservoir quality west\nof the axes is due to greater heterogeneity from interbedding of low- and\nmoderate-depositional-energy facies, with associated drop in porosity and\npermeability. Decrease in production east of the axes results primarily from a\ncombination of seaward thinning of the primary reservoir facies and\nnon-deposition of sand ridges.\n\nThe House Creek field has two axis orientations; these are related to\ndepositional patterns of the four sand ridges. Deposition of the \"B\" sandstone\nbegan in the southeastern corner of the field with sand ridge 1; axis\norientation is about north 20 degrees west. Later-deposited sand ridges 2\nthrough 4 are located west and north of sand ridge 1; their axis orientations\nare approximately north 32 degrees west. Progressive northward deposition of\nlater sand ridges is probably concurrent with uplift of the northeast-trending\nBelle Fourche arch. Movement along the arch and of lineaments may have caused\ntopographic highs that localized Sussex and Shannon deposition proximal to the\narch. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
