    "description": "A 3.5-year study was conducted to determine the signifcance of atmospheric\ndeposition to the pesticide concentrations in runoff. Both wet and dry\natmospheric depostion were collected at six sites in the central San Joaquin\nValley, California. Wet deposition samples were collected during individual\nrain events and dry deposition samples were collected for periods ranging from\nthree weeks to four months. Each sample was analyzed for 41 currently used\npesticides and 23 transformation products, including the oxygen analogs of nine\norganophosphorus (OP) insecticides. Ten compounds in rainfall and 19 in dry\ndeposition were detected in at least 50% of the samples.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
