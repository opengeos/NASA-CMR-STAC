    "description": "The ECO3ANCQA Version 1 data product was decommissioned on September 30, 2025. \n\nThe ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52 degrees N and 52 degrees S latitudes. \n\nThe ECO3ANCQA Version 1 is a Level 3 (L3) product that provides Quality Assessment (QA) fields for all ancillary data used in L3 and Level 4 (L4) products generated by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). No quality flags are generated for the L3 or L4 products. Instead, the quality flags of the source data products are resampled by nearest neighbor onto the geolocation of the ECOSTRESS scene. A quality flag array for each input dataset, when available, is collected into the combined QA product.\n\nThe ECO3ANCQA Version 1 data product contains layers of quality flags for ECOSTRESS cloud mask, Landsat 8, land cover type, albedo, MODIS Terra aerosol, MODIS Terra Cloud 1 km, MODIS Terra Cloud 5 km, MODIS Terra atmospheric profile, vegetation indices, MODIS Terra gross primary productivity, and MODIS water mask.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\n* Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\n* Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",
