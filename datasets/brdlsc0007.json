    "description": "An evaluation of adaptive cluster sampling was based on a simulation\nexperiment where samples were drawn from an enumeration of three\nspecies of waterfowl wintering in central Florida.  The initial\nsamples were taken either by simple random sampling or with\nprobability proportional to available habitat. Efficiency of adaptive\ncluster sampling relative to simple random sampling was highest when\n1) the within-network variance was close to the population variance,\nand 2) the final sampling fraction was close to the initial sampling\nfraction.  The within-network variance is determined by the spatial\ndistribution of the population, quadrat size, and the condition that\ndetermined when to adapt sampling.  The final sampling fraction\ndepends on the previous factors as well as the size and selection of\nthe initial sample. Some combinations of these factors led to\nincreased precision compared to simple random sampling and some did\nnot.\n\nGeographic Description:\nCentral Florida (5,000 km2).  The study region extended 100 km east\nand 50 km north from the southwest corner at 0438000, 3056000\n(Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates; zone 17). 1.5.2 Bounding\nRectangle Coordinates\n\nMethodology:\nAn effort was made to count every individual duck of the three\nwaterfowl species in a 5,000 km2 area of central Florida by making\nsystematic flights over the entire study region.  Two biologists\ncounted waterfowl from separate helicopters (Bell Jet Rangers) during\n13-15 December, 1992 and used the LORAN-C and GPS systems to determine\nflock locations Field.",
