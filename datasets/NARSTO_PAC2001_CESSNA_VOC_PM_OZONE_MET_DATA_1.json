    "description": "The NARSTO_PAC2001_CESSNA_VOC_PM_OZONE_MET_DATA were obtained between August 14 and August 31, 2001 during the Pacific 2001 Air Quality Study (PAC2001).The missions of the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Cessna 188 were to support the ground-based measurements at the Slocan Park (SL) site, the Langley Ecole Lochiel (LEL) site, and the Eagle Ridge site on Sumas Mountain (SER). Integration of the measurements on the Cessna with ground measurements was envisioned to provide the vertical chemical and thermal structure of the lowest part of the boundary layer at the sites, and how particle characteristics changes with altitude within the boundary layer. The Cessna flights included profiling and specialized flight patterns. The profiling was made over the sites and at the model boundaries. The profiling provided vertical profiles of O3, particle number size distribution from 0.12 to and total particle counts, VOCs, and meteorological parameters at these locations. During race-track flight patterns, filters were collected at 50, 100, and 300 m altitudes, for inorganic and OC/EC components. On August 20, based on forecast forward trajectories, the Cessna flew along the trajectories starting from the LEL site at the 500 m altitude in an attempt to understanding the time evolution of particles.The Pacific 2001 Air Quality Study (PAC2001) was conducted from 1 August to 31 September, 2001 in the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV), British Columbia, Canada. The study consisted of individual research projects organized to address several issues on ambient particulate matter and ozone that are important to policy makers. A special issue of Atmospheric Environment [Vol. 38(34), Nov 2004] described specific study objectives (Li, 2004) and presented a series of results papers from the field study. The ground sampling sites during the study were (1) Cassiar Tunnel, (2) Slocan Park, (3) Langley Ecole Lochiel, (4) Sumas Eagle Ridge, and (5) Golden Ears Provincial Park. Aloft measurements were taken from a Convair 580 and a Cessna 188. Selected measurement data were compiled for each site and aircraft and are archived as site-specific data sets.NARSTO (formerly North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone) is a public/private partnership, whose membership spans government, the utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission is to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are available.",
