    "description": "The RAN Australian Hydrographic Service have conducted hydrographic surveys near the coasts of the Australian Antarctic Territory and Heard Island and Macquarie Island.\nData and metadata for hydrographic surveys by the RAN Australian Hydrographic Service in Antarctica and at Heard Island and Macquarie Island has been provided to the Australian Antarctic Data Centre by the Australian Hydrographic Office. The survey locations in Antarctica were Mawson, Davis, Casey and Commonwealth Bay. The surveys were conducted since December 1993. Generally the surveys are denoted by a Hydrographic Instruction (HI) eg HI176. There is a metadata record for each survey from which the survey data and metadata can be obtained. The metadata records for the individual surveys are linked to this metadata record.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Data Centre has also had the soundings digitised from the fair sheets produced from earlier hydrographic surveys by the RAN Australian Hydrographic Service at Casey, Davis and Mawson. Metadata records describe the digitised soundings are also linked to this metadata record.",
