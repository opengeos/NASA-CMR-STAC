    "description": "Severe flooding occurred on June 4, 2002, in the Indian Creek Basin in Linn\nCounty, Iowa, following thunderstorm activity over east-central Iowa. The rain\ngage at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, recorded a 24-hour rainfall of 4.76 inches at 6:00\np.m. on June 4th. Radar indications estimated as much as 6 inches of rain fell\nin the headwaters of the Indian Creek Basin. Peak discharges on Indian Creek of\n12,500 cubic feet per second at County Home Road north of Marion, Iowa, and\n24,300 cubic feet per second at East Post Road in southeast Cedar Rapids, were\ndetermined for the flood. The recurrence interval for these peak discharges\nboth exceed the theoretical 500-year flood as computed using flood-estimation\nequations developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Information about the basin\nand flood history, the 2002 thunderstorms and associated flooding, and a\nprofile of high-water marks are presented for selected reaches along Indian and\nDry Creeks.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
