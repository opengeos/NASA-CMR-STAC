    "description": "Benthic organisms and phytoplankton were collected using sediment sampler and net casts in the Gulf of Mexico. Data were submitted by Texas A&M University with support from the Brine Disposal project. Data were collected from the CAPT. BRADY J and other platforms from 10 October 1982 to 30 November 1983. Data has been been processed by NODC to the NODC standard F028- Phytoplankton F132- Benthic Organisms formats. Full format and format code descriptions are available at http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-datafmts.html.\n\nThe F028 format is used for data from the sampling and analysis of marine phytoplankton. Information on phytoplankton abundance, distribution, and productivity derived from these data support studies of marine populations and ecosystems. Data reported may include: position, date, and time of sampling; bottom depth and sampling depths; volume of water filtered; and concentration of cells, carbon concentration, wet and dry weight, and counts for each species reported. Comments may be relayed in a text record.\n\nThe F132 format contains data from field sampling or surveys of bottom dwelling marine organisms. The data provide information on species abundance, distribution, and biomass; they may have been collected by point sampling (grab or core), by tow (dredge, trawl or net), by photographic surveys, or by other methods. Cruise information such as vessel, start and end dates, investigator, and institution/agency; station numbers, positions and times; and equipment and methods are reported for each survey. Environmental data reported at each sampling site may include meteorological and sea surface conditions; surface and bottom temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen; and sediment characteristics. Number of individual organisms and total weight of organisms is reported for each species. A text record is available for comments.",
