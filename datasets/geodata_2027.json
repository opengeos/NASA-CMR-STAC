    "description": "Threatened species are those listed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU).\n\nCRITICALLY ENDANGERED (CR) \nA taxon is Critically Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Critically Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. \n\nENDANGERED (EN) \nA taxon is Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. \n\nVULNERABLE (VU) \nA taxon is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.\nA part from the mammals, birds, amphibians and gymnosperms (i.e., those groups completely or almost completely evaluated), the figures in the last column are gross over-estimates of the percentage threatened due to biases in the assessment process towards assessing species that are thought to be threatened, species for which data are readily available, and under-reporting of Least Concern species. The true value for the percentage threatened lies somewhere in the range indicated by the two right-hand columns. In most cases this represents a very broad range. For example, the true percentage of threatened insects lies somewhere between 0.07% and 50%. Hence, although 39% of all species on the IUCN Red List are listed as threatened, this figure needs to be treated with extreme caution given the biases described above.\n",
