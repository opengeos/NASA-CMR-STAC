    "description": "Digital aerial photography was flown by a contractor for the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) from CASA 212-400 aircraft during the 2010-11 season. \n\nPhotographs were taken for various projects or needs:\nWhales project requested by Natalie Kelly (Science Branch AAD and CSIRO); Cronk Islands, Knox Coast, Wilkes Coast - requested by Colin Southwell (Science Branch AAD, AAS project 2722) - the coverage also includes Bailey Peninsula and part of Clark Peninsula; Frazier Islands - requested by Ian Hay (Strategies Branch AAD, AAS project 3154); Aurora Basin - taken on the return flight from Dome C to Casey of Aurora Basin GC41 position 71 degrees 36'10''S, 111 degrees 15'46''E; Wilkins Aerodrome - to photograph runway and melt; Casey, Wilkes - requested by Gill Slocum (Strategies Branch AAD). \n\nThe photographs were taken between 2 January 2011 and 6 February 2011. In most cases the images were georeferenced in the camera using the aircraft GPS.\n\nVertical photographs were taken with an in floor camera system using a Nikon D200 digital camera and oblique photographs were taken using a handheld Nikon D700 digital camera in the cockpit.\n\nThe set of images is too big for download but the images are available upon request from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre.\n\nData extracted from the exif information of the images are available for download as csv files and, in some cases, shapefiles. These data include file name, date, camera, focal length, latitude, longitude and altitude.\n\nThe images of the Cronk Islands and the Frazier Islands can be viewed in the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's Aerial Photograph Catalogue - see a Related URL below. The Film/Digital Series are ANTD1260 (Cronk Islands and Frazier Islands 2 January 2011) and ANTD1261 (Frazier Islands 23 January 2011).",
