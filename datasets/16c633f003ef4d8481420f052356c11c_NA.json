    "description": "This dataset contains monthly-averaged land surface temperatures (LSTs) and their uncertainty estimates from the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2) on European Remote-sensing Satellite 2 (ERS-2). Satellite land surface temperatures are skin temperatures, which means, for example, the temperature of the ground surface in bare soil areas, the temperature of the canopy over forests, and a mix of the soil and leaf temperature over sparse vegetation. The skin temperature is an important variable when considering surface fluxes of, for instance, heat and water.Daytime and nighttime temperatures are provided in separate files corresponding to the morning and evening ERS-2 equator crossing times which are 10:30 and 22:30 local solar time. Per pixel uncertainty estimates are given in two forms, first, an estimate of the total uncertainty for the pixel and second, a breakdown of the uncertainty into components by correlation length.Also provided in the files, on a per pixel basis, are the observation time, the satellite viewing and solar geometry angles, a quality flag,  and land cover class.The dataset coverage is near global over the land surface. Small regions were not covered due to downlinking constraints (most noticeably a track extending southwards across central Asia through India \u00e2\u0080\u0093 further details can be found on the ATSR project webpages at http://www.atsr.rl.ac.uk/dataproducts/availability/coverage/atsr-2/index.shtml.LSTs are provided on a global equal angle grid at a resolution of 0.01\u00c2\u00b0 longitude and 0.01\u00c2\u00b0 latitude. ATSR-2 achieves full Earth coverage in 3 days so the daily files have gaps where the surface is not covered by the satellite swath on that day. Furthermore, LSTs are not produced where clouds are present since under these circumstances the IR radiometer observes the cloud top which is usually much colder than the surface.Dataset coverage starts on 1st August 1995 and ends on 22nd June 2003. There are two gaps of several months in the dataset: no data were acquired from ATSR-2 between 23 December 1995 and 30 June 1996 due to a scan mirror anomaly; and the ERS-2 gyro failed in January 2001, data quality was less good between 17th Jan 2001 and 5th July 2001 and are not used in this dataset. There are minor interruptions (1-2 days) during satellite/instrument maintenance periods.The dataset was produced by the University of Leicester (UoL) and LSTs were retrieved using the (UoL) LST retrieval algorithm and data were processed in the UoL processing chain.The dataset was produced as part of the ESA Land Surface Temperature Climate Change Initiative which strives to improve satellite datasets to Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) standards.",
