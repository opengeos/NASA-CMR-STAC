    "description": "We modelled the spatial distribution of 20 permanent grassland habitats at the level of phytosociological alliances according to the Swiss habitat typology (TypoCH; Delarze et al. 2015) at 10x10 m resolution across Switzerland. The 20 grassland habitat types belong to the following habitat groups: fens, wet meadows, raised bogs, re-seeded and heavy fertilized grasslands, dry grasslands, nutrient-poor alpine and subalpine grasslands, nutrient-rich pastures and meadows as well as fallow grasslands.     We followed a two-step approach:     (1) Ensemble models provide **distribution maps of the 20 individual grassland habitat types**, using training data from various sources. Predictors were Copernicus Sentinel satellite imagery and variables describing climate, soil and topography. The performance of these maps was assessed with the True Skill Statistics and split\u2010sampling of the data.     Available maps for each grassland habitat: (1) *Map of the median of predicted probability of occurrence*; (2) *Map of the standard deviation of the predicted probability of occurrence* (available upon request); (3) *Binary presence/absence map* (available upon request). For an overview, see *Overview: Maps of the individual grassland habitats*.    (2) **Combined maps**: The individual maps were combined into countrywide maps of the most and second most likely habitat type, respectively, using an expert\u2010based weighting approach. The performance of the combined map for the most likely habitat type was assessed via an independent testing dataset and a comparison of the predicted habitat\u2010type proportions with extrapolations from field surveys.    Available combined maps: Map of the most likely habitat type (M1F; after regional corrections); Map of the second most likely habitat type (M2); Map of the most likely habitat type without regional corrections (available upon request); Map of the weighted median of the predicted probability of occurrence for the most/second most likely habitat type, respectively (available upon request); map of the ratio of the probabilities of occurrence of the most and second most likely habitat types (available upon request)",
