    "description": "Coccolithophore fluxes were investigated over a one-year period (2001-02) at the southern Antarctic Zone in the Australian Sector of the Southern Ocean at the site of the Southern\nOcean Iron Release Experiment (SOIREE) near 61\u00b0S, 140\u00b0E. Two vertically moored sediment traps were deployed at 2000 and 3700 m below sea-level during a period of 10 months. In these data sets we present the results on the temporal and vertical variability of total coccolith flux, species composition and seasonal changes in coccolith weights of E. huxleyi populations estimated using circularly polarised micrographs analysed with C-Calcita software. A description of the field experiment, diatom and biogeochemical fluxes can be found in Rigual-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2015), while a detailed description of sample processing and counting of coccolithophores can be found in Rigual-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2018). Moreover, an explanation of the estimation of Emiliania huxleyi coccoliths using C-Calcita software can be also found in Rigual-Hernandez et al. (2018). \nCoccolithophore assemblages captured by the traps were nearly monospecific for Emiliania huxleyi morphotype B/C. Coccolith fluxes showed strong seasonal cycle at both sediment trap depths. The maximum coccolith export occurred during summer and was divided into two peaks in early January (2.2 x 109 coccoliths m-2 d-1 at 2000 m) and in mid-February (9.8 x 108 coccoliths m-2 d-1). Coccolith flux was very low in winter (down to ~7 x 107 coccoliths m-2 d-1). Coccolith fluxes in the deeper trap (3700 m) followed a similar pattern to that in the 2000 m trap with a delay of about one sampling interval. Coccoliths intercepted by the traps exhibited a weight and length reduction during summer. The annual coccolith weight at both sediment traps was 2.11 plus or minus 0.96 and 2.13 plus or minus 0.91 pg at 2000 m and 3700 m, respectively. Our coccolith mass estimation was consistent with previous reports for morphotype B/C in other regions of the Southern Ocean. \n\nData available: two excel files containing sampling dates and depths, raw counts, relative abundance and fluxes (coccoliths m-2 d-1) of the coccolithophore species, and morphometric measurements of Emiliania huxleyi coccoliths made with C-Calcita software. \nEach file contains four spreadsheets: raw coccolith counts, relative abundance of coccolithophore species and coccolith flux of each coccolithophore species identified and E. huxleyi morphometrics. \n\nDetailed information of the column headings is provided below.\n\nCup \u2013 Cup (=sample) number\nDepth \u2013 vertical location of the sediment trap in meters below the surface \nMid-point date - Mid date of the sampling interval\nLength (days) \u2013 number of days the cup was open",
