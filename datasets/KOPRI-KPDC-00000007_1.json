    "description": "Korean Antarctic survey carried out as part of step 3 project in year 1 of \u2018The Antarctic Undersea Geological Survey\u2019 was conducted in the Powell Basin of the northern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. The research period was from 3 Dec. to 11 Dec. (9 days) in 2000. After geophysical research including acquisition of seismic data, submarine topography, geomagnatic data was conducted in coring point was decided from combined geophysical data. \nWe took on lease Russian icebreaker \"Yuzhmorgeologiya\" and 13 researcher from \u2018Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute\u2019 including a field winter researcher in the cruise. \nDue to a lot of icebergs and floating ice in the area, the originally planned survey of the side lines is impossible. A survey was conducted on the modified side lines.",
