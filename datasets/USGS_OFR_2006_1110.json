    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted geophysical studies in support of\nthe resource appraisal of the Crump Geyser Known Geothermal Resource Area\n(KGRA). This area was designated as a KGRA by the USGS, and this designation\nbecame effective on December 24, 1970. The land classification standards for a\nKGRA were established by the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-581).\nFederal lands so classified required competitive leasing for the development of\ngeothermal resources.\n\nThe author presented an administrative report of USGS geophysical studies\nentitled \"Geophysical background of the Crump Geyser area, Oregon, KGRA\" to a\nUSGS resource committee on June 17, 1975. This report, which essentially was a\ndescription of geophysical data and a preliminary interpretation without\ndiscussion of resource appraisal, is in Appendix 1. Reduction of sheets or\nplates in the original administrative report to page-size figures, which are\nlisted and appended to the back of the text in Appendix 1, did not seem to\nsignificantly degrade legibility. Bold print in the text indicates where minor\nchanges were made. A colored page-size index and tectonic map, which also show\nregional geology not shown in figure 2, was substituted for original figure 1.\nDetailed descriptions for the geologic units referenced in the text and shown\non figures 1 and 2 were separately defined by Walker and Repenning (1965) and\npresumably were discussed in other reports to the committee. Heavy dashed lines\non figures 1 and 2 indicate the approximate KGRA boundary.\n\nOne of the principal results of the geophysical studies was to obtain a gravity\nmap (Appendix 1, fig. 10; Plouff, and Conradi, 1975, pl. 9), which reflects the\nfault-bounded steepness of the west edge of sediments and locates the maximum\nthickness of valley sediments at about 10 kilometers south of Crump Geyser.\nBased on the indicated regional-gravity profile and density-contrast\nassumptions for the two-dimensional profile, the maximum sediment thickness was\nestimated at 820 meters. A three-dimensional gravity model would have yielded a\ngreater thickness. Audiomagnotelluric measurements were not made as far south\nas the location of the gravity low, as determined in the field, due to a lack\nof communication at that time. A boat was borrowed to collect gravity\nmeasurements along the edge of Crump Lake, but the attempt was curtailed by\nharsh, snowy weather on May 21, 1975, which shortly followed days of hot\ntemperature.\n\nMost of the geophysical data and illustrations in Appendix 1 have been\npublished (Gregory and Martinez, 1975; Plouff, 1975; and Plouff and Conradi,\n1975), and Donald Plouff (1986) discussed a gravity interpretation of Warner\nValley at the Fall 1986 American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.\nFurther interpretation of possible subsurface geologic sources of geophysical\nanomalies was not discussed in Appendix 1. For example, how were apparent\nresistivity lows (Appendix 1, figs. 3-6) centered near Crump Geyser affected by\na well and other manmade electrically conductive or magnetic objects? What is\nthe geologic significance of the 15-milligal eastward decrease across Warner\nValley? The explanation that the two-dimensional gravity model (Appendix 1,\nfig. 14) was based on an inverse iterative method suggested by Bott (1960) was\nnot included. Inasmuch as there was no local subsurface rock density\ndistribution information to further constrain the gravity model, the\nthree-dimensional methodology suggested by Plouff (1976) was not attempted.\n\nInasmuch as the associated publication by Plouff (1975), which released the\ngravity data, is difficult to obtain and not in digital format, that report is\nreproduced in Appendix 2. Two figures of the publication are appended to the\nback of the text. A later formula for the theoretical value of gravity for the\ngiven latitudes at sea level (International Association of Geodesy, 1971)\nshould be used to re-compute gravity anomalies. To merge the observed-gravity\nvalues printed in that report with later measurements, an empirically\ndetermined constant gravity datum shift should be applied. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
