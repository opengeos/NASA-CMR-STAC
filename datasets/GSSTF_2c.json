    "description": "These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-2c (GSSTF2c) Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. \n\nGSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. \n\nGSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. \n\nThis is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. \n\nA finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3. \n\nThe GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the \"final\" GSSTF, Version 2c, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.\n      \nThere are only one set of GSSTF, Version 2c, Combined data, \"Set1\" \n            \nThe \"individual\" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:\n      GSSTF_Fxx_2c, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)\n      \n      The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP]. Relevant to this MEaSUREs project, these are converted to HDF-EOS5, and are stored in the GSSTF_NCEP_2c collection. \n      \n      Please use these products with care and proper citations, i.e., properly indicating your applications with, e.g., \"using the combined 2001 data file of Set1\" or \"using the 2001 F13 data file\". \n            \n      APPENDIX SET1\n      ---------------\n      The following list summarizes individual satellites used to produce the Combined SET1. \n      \n      (1) Y1987/:\n          F08/\n          1987/07-12:  F08  (Note: 1987/12 is filled with missing value due to data scarcity)\n      \n      (2) Y1988/:\n          F08/\n          1988/01-12:  F08\n      \n      (3) Y1989/:\n          F08/\n          1989/01-12:  F08\n      \n      (4) Y1990:\n          F08/ F10/\n          1990/01-12:  F08 (Note: F10 started in 1990/12, but N/A due to data scarcity)\n      \n      (5) Y1991/:\n          F08/  F10/\n          1991/01-12:  F08+F10\n      \n      (6) Y1992/:\n          F10/  F11/\n          1992/01-12:  F10+F11\n      \n      (7) Y1993/:\n          F10/  F11/\n          1993/01-12:  F10+F11\n      \n      (8) Y1994/:\n          F10/  F11/\n          1994/01-12:  F10+F11\n      \n      (9) Y1995/:\n          F10/  F11/  F13/\n          1995/01-12:  01-04: F10+F11\n                       05-12: F10+F11+F13\n      \n      (10) Y1996/:\n           F10/  F11/  F13/\n           1996/01-12:  F10+F11+F13\n      \n      (11) Y1997/:\n           F10/  F11/  F13/  F14/\n           1997/01-12:  01-04: F10+F11+F13\n                        05/01-11/14: F10+F11+F13+F14\n                        11/15-12/31: F11+F13+F14\n      \n      (12) Y1998/:\n           F11/  F13/  F14/\n           1998/01-12:  F11+F13+F14\n      \n      (13) Y1999/:\n           F11/  F13/  F14/\n           1999/01-12:  F11+F13+F14\n      \n      (14) Y2000/:\n           F11/  F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2000/01-12:  01/01-05/16: F11+F13+F14+F15\n                        05/17-12/31: F13+F14+F15\n      \n      (15) Y2001/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2001/01-12: F13+F14+F15\n      \n      (16) Y2002/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2002/01-12: F13+F14+F15\n      \n      (17) Y2003/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2003/01-12: F13+F14+F15\n      \n      (18) Y2004/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2004/01-12: F13+F14+F15\n      \n      (19) Y2005/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2005/01-12: F13+F14+F15\n      \n      (20) Y2006/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2006/01-12: F13+F14 \n      \n      (21) Y2007/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2007/01-12: F13+F14 \n      \n      (22) Y2008/:\n           F13/  F14/  F15/\n           2008/01-12: 01-07: F13+F14 \n                       08-12: F13 \n      \n      Special notes:\n      \n        (a) For Y2006, Y2007 and Y2008, the current Combined daily data files do not include the F15 Individual daily data files due to problematic calibration in F15.
