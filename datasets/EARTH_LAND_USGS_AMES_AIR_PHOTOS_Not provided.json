    "description": "The aerial photography inventoried by the Pilot Land Data System \n(PLDS) at NASA AMES Research Center has been transferred to the USGS\nEROS  Data Center.  The photos were obtained from cameras mounted on\nhigh and  medium altitude aircraft based at the NASA Ames Research\nCenter.  Several  cameras with varying focal lengths, lenses and film\nformats are used, but  the Wild RC-10 camera with a focal length of 152\nmillimeters and a 9 by 9  inch film format is most common.  The positive\ntransparencies are typically  used for ancillary ground checks in\nconjunctions with digital processing for  the same sites.  The aircraft\nflights, specifically requested by scientists  performing approved\nresearch, often simultaneously collect data using other  sensors on       \nboard (e.g. Thematic Mapper Simulators (TMS) and Thermal Infrared \nMultispectral Scanners).  High altitude color infrared photography is\nused  regularly by government agencies for such applications as crop\nyield forecasting,  timber inventory and defoliation assessment, water\nresource management,  land use surveys, water pollution monitoring, and\nnatural disaster  assessment.\n\nTo order, specify the latitude and longitude of interest.  You will  then be\ngiven a list of photos available for that location.  In some cases,  \"flight\nbooks\" are available at EDC that describe the nature of the mission  during\nwhich the photos were taken and other attribute information.  The  customer\nservice personnel have access to these books for those photo sets  for which\nthe books exist.",
