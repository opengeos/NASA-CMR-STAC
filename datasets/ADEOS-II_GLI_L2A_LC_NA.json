    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L2 Land and Cryosphere is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km. This product is ADEOS-II/GLI L2 Land and Cryosphere data is map-projected global full resolution product. This data is generated each 16days and most cloud-free pixel is selected, mosaicking is performed. This product consists of 56 areas. Northern and southern 4 area is polar-stereographic projected. Middle latitude region is equi-rectangular grid and separated 48 areas (30deg. x 30deg.). The resolution is about 1km. The provided format is HDF. The channels (band: 1,5,8,13,15,17,19,24,26,27,28,29,30,31,34,35,36) necessary for land and cryosphere algorithms are included. Cloud flag and land-water flag are attached. The resolution is 1km. Each pixel has solar and satellite zenith/azimuth angle, observation date. In 16 days, there are 4 opportunities in one ground point at least because ADEOS-II recurrent period is 4 days. The time difference of adjacent pixels are 16 days in maximum. The observation condition of each pixel is different. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
