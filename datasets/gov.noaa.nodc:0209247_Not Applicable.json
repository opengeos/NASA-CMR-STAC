    "description": "The benthic cover and fishing-net related data described in this dataset are derived from the GIS analysis of benthic orthophotos. The source imagery was collected using a Structure from Motion (SfM) approach during in-water marine debris swim surveys conducted by snorkelers in search of derelict fishing nets. Surveys were conducted by the NOAA Fisheries, Ecosystem Sciences Division (ESD) from September 24 to October 3, 2018 at Pearl and Hermes Atoll during an ESD-led marine debris mission to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) aboard NOAA Ship Oscar Elton Sette. The lagoon at Pearl and Hermes was surveyed equally across the spatial gradient, from locations where derelict fishing nets are common to locations where derelict fishing nets have never been observed.\n\nDuring the 2018 mission, only a subset of marine debris surveys resulted in a SfM survey. Fishing nets were located during swim surveys and selected for SfM if the net was interacting with coral or hard substrate, the depth of the net was within ~1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 m of the surface, and the area of the net fit within the 9 sq. meter SFM survey plot. During a SFM survey, a permanent 3 x 3 m plot was established around the center of the fishing net, and the net was photographed using a back and forth swim pattern (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore\u00e2\u0080\u009d photos) for later processing using a SfM approach. The net was then removed, the volume of net removed was estimated and recorded, and the same area was photographed again in the same way (\u00e2\u0080\u009cafter\u00e2\u0080\u009d photos). A nearby (>50 m distant) paired control site was also photographed using the same method (\u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d photos).\n\nThe photographs were processed using Agisoft Metashape software to generate orthomosaic images that were analyzed in ArcGIS for benthic cover using a random point approach. The number of points at net-impacted sites were constrained to the net coverage area and were scaled to the net area to ensure an equal point density among replicate net-impact sites. The same number of points were randomly assigned to the 3 \u00c3\u0097 3 m paired control site. Each point was classified into one of seven benthic categories: turf algae, macroalgae, sand, bare substrate, Porites compressa, sponge, or crustose coralline algae (CCA). The annotated points for each site were converted to percent cover for each benthic category. Fishing net size (sq m) and degree of fouling were also calculated from the orthophotos. Analyses were conducted to compare the benthic composition of net sites to control sites and to determine if fouling or net size contributed to these differences.",
