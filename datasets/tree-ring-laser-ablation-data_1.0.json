    "description": "This dataset contains the values of several chemical elements (Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Tl, Pb, Bi) measured in the latewood of tree rings of Mongolian oak from Harbin, China, at a 5-year resolution. Due to the lack of a suitable reference material for wood, absolute concentration was not calculated, and the ratio between the chemical element and 13C was taken as proxy for the element signal.    In Harbin, one of the largest cities and most important industrial centers in northeastern China, air quality monitoring systems were built only by the end of 2015 to meet the national requirements. Thus, dendrochemical analyses could be used as a tool to complement for the lack of air quality data over longer periods of time, allowing for the reconstruction of the temporal trend of trace metals. Our main scopes were to: (a) assess the chemical composition of Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb. tree rings from Harbin using a recently developed system of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), (b) identify the main chemical elements which  derived from air pollution and may be used as indicators over the period 1965\u20132020 in Harbin, while excluding those that were controlled by physiological processes in the tree, and (c) reconstruct the history of pollution in Harbin by comparing the tree-ring chemical composition of recent decades with that of previous decades, in trees growing in the highly polluted city of Harbin and in trees growing in a control site 90 km away from major pollution sources.    Briefly, the temporal trend of some elements was influenced by physiological factors, by environmental factors such as pollution, or influenced by both. Mg, K, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, As, Sr and Tl showed changes in pollution levels over time.",
