    "description": "GCOM-C/SGLI L1A Visible and Near Infrared (Non-Polarization) (250m) dataset is obtained from the SGLI sensor onboard GCOM-C and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GCOM-C is Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent Orbit satellite launched on December 23, 2017, which mounts SGLI and conducts long-term global observations of geophysical variables related to the global climate system across 28 items including aerosol and vegetation over 4 areas of atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere. The data will be used to contribute to higher accuracy of global warming prediction. The SGLI has swath of 1150 km in the visible band and 1400 km in the infrared band. GCOM-C/SGLI Level 1A products are using the data from the satellite as inputs and the following processes are applied on the input data: determination scene range, deletion of duplicated packets and filling of missing data with dummy data, calculation of radiometric correction information, calculation of geometric information and creation of missing packet information and quality information. This product is the intensity of reflected light scattered and absorbed by the atmosphere and the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface using Non Polarized observation. Observation DN value are stored for each band as image data. The provided format is HDF5. The spatial resolution is 250 m. 1 km is also available. The geometry is not corrected, and the observation position of ground of pixel is varied each band. Therefore, the latitude/longitude information of 10 pixels interval in each band is appended. However, there is no interval in AT direction of IRS. The stored geometric information is the center position of the pixel. The current version of the product is Version 2.",
