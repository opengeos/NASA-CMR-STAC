    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 1174\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nAustralia's World Heritage listed subantarctic Heard and McDonald  Islands are experiencing rapid climate change. Their terrestrial and  coastal ecosystems are poorly known. This multidisciplinary project will gather baseline data on ecosystem biodiversity and species distribution, and make predictions about responses to future environmental change, providing vital information for conservation protocols.\n\nThe download file contains two excel spreadsheets and a pdf copy of the referenced paper.\n\nFrom the abstract of the referenced paper:\n\nDuring an early summer visit in 2000, mosses were collected from sites around Heard Island.  Three species, Bryoerythrophyllum recurvirostrum, Philonotis cf. tenuis and Syntrichia filaris have been added to the list of moss species known from the island, bringing the total to 40 moss taxa.  Syntrichia anderssonii was found with sporophytes, whereas previously its sporophytes were known in the subantarctic only from Macquarie Island.  Extensions of range on Heard Island have been recorded for several species.  There are few geographical differences in species composition between locations around the island, provided appropriate habitats exist.",
