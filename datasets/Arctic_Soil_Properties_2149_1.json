    "description": "This dataset provides lab-measured soil properties, including soil water matric potential, soil dielectric properties, soil electrical conductivity, corresponding soil moisture. The dataset also includes the basic soil physical properties such as soil organic matter, bulk density, porosity, fiber content, root biomass, and mineral texture. Soil samples were collected from August 21 to August 27, 2018, from the surface to permafrost table in soil pits at nine sites along the Dalton Highway in northern and central regions of Alaska. Permittivity and soil electrical conductivity measurements were conducted using METER TEROS 12 probes. Soil moisture measurements were made with a TEROS 21 probe. The measurements were conducted in the lab over the span of three years. The purpose of soil collection and lab measurements was to develop an integrated framework that relates the hydrological properties to dielectric properties of permafrost active layer soil in support of the NASA Arctic and Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Airborne Campaign.",
