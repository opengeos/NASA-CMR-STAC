    "description": "This data set was created to archive the calculated stream flow gains and\nlosses of selected streams in part of the Republican River Basin, Nebraska, in\nApril and May 1980, and make the data available for use with geographic\ninformation systems (GUS).\n\nThis arc and point data set contains stream flow-measurement sites and reaches\nindicating stream flow gain or loss under base-flow conditions along Republican\nRiver tributaries in Nebraska during April 28 to May 1, 1980 (U.S. Geological\nSurvey, 1981). The stream flow measurements were made to obtain data on\nground-water/surface-water interaction. Flow was observed visually to be zero,\nwas measured, or was estimated at 147 sites. The measurements were made on the\nmain stem of the Republican River and all flowing tributaries that enter the\nRepublican River between Muddy Creek in western Hitchcock County and Deer Creek\nin western Furnas County, Nebraska. Tributaries were followed upstream until\nthe first road crossing where zero flow was encountered. For selected streams,\npoints of zero flow upstream of the first zero flow site also were checked.\n\nStream flow gain or loss for each stream reach was calculated by subtracting\nthe stream flow values measured at the upstream end of the reach and values for\ncontributing tributaries from the downstream value. The data obtained reflected\nbase-flow conditions suitable for estimating stream flow gains and losses for\nstream reaches between sites.\n\nThis digital data set was created by manually splitting the lines from a\n1:250,000 hydrography data set (Soenksen and others, 1999) at every stream flow\nmeasurement site. Each set of stream segments between measurement sites was\nassigned a unique reach number.\n\n\n  This digital data set was created by manually plotting locations of stream\nflow measurements. These points were used to designate steam-reach segments to\ncalculate gain/loss per river mile.\n\n  Reach segments were created by manually splitting the lines from a 1:250,000\nhydrography data set (Soenksen and others, 1999) at every location where the\nstreams were measured. Each stream-reach segment between stream flow\nmeasurement sites was assigned a unique reach number. All other lines in the\nhydrography data set without reach numbers were omitted.",
