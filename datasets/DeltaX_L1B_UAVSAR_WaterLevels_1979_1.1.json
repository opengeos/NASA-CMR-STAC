    "description": "This dataset contains UAVSAR Level 1B (L1B) interferometric products for Delta-X flight lines acquired during the 2021 Spring (2021-03-27 to 2021-04-18) and Fall (2021-09-03 to 2021-09-13) deployments. The data were collected by Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), a polarimetric L-band synthetic aperture radar flown on the NASA Gulfstream-III (C20) aircraft as part of the Delta-X campaign. The study area includes the Atchafalaya Basin, in Southern Louisiana, USA, within the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) floodplain. Repeat pass interferometric synthetic aperture (InSAR) data are a standard UAVSAR product delivered by the UAVSAR processing team. For this dataset, a set of nearest-neighbor (NN), NN+1, and NN+2 co-registered VV-polarization interferograms were generated from the quad-polarization SLC stack level-1 (L1) product using a combination of the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE), the statistical-cost, network-flow algorithm for phase unwrapping (SNAPHU), and previously developed python code. Data quality was assessed by comparing water elevation estimates with data from in situ water level gauges throughout the study area. The data are provided in non-georeferenced ENVI file format and include interferometric amplitude, wrapped interferometric phase, interferometric coherence, and unwrapped interferometric phase products. Geometry files for each flight line per field campaign with latitude, longitude, height and incidence angle information are also included. The goal of this campaign was to measure water-level changes throughout wetlands, and these data may be used to generate time series of water levels. The data are provided in ENVI format.",
