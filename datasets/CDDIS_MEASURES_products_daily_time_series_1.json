    "description": "Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) empowers the research community to participate in developing and generating data products that complement and augment NASA produced and distributed Earth science data products. NASA\u2019s Enhanced Solid Earth Science Earth Science Data Record (ESDR) System (ESESES) continues and extends mature geodetic data product generation and archival as part of the MEaSUREs SESES project providing new, multi-decade, calibrated and validated geodetic-derived ESDRs obtained by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). These data-derived products include continuous multi-year high-rate GNSS, seismogeodetic, and meteorological time series, a catalog of transient deformation in tectonically active areas known for aseismic motion such as ETS with focus in Cascadia, and continuous estimation and cataloging of total near-surface water content derived from continuous GNSS time series over the continental U.S. These data products are daily geodetic displacement time series (compressed). They are combined, cleaned and filtered, GIPSY-GAMIT long-term time series of Continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (CGNSS) station positions (global and regional) in the latest version of ITRF\r\n",
