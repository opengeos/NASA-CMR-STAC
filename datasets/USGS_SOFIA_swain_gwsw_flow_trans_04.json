    "description": "This project focuses on the implementation, verification, and validation of a system of coupling numerical models to represent the interaction between the ground-water and surface-water systems in the SICS and TIME areas. In this investigation, multidimensional coupled surface-water/ ground-water models have been developed for the southern Florida wetlands and offshore area. The initial surface-water model, the SICS model, represents the southeast coastal region with the two-dimensional dynamic wave model SWIFT2D. The coupling with the SEAWAT three-dimensional ground-water model allows leakage to be represented with salinity transfer included. In order to represent regional restoration scenarios, the SICS model is to be linked via boundary water levels to the regional South Florida Water Management Model. Uses of this modeling system will include nutrient transport simulations for determining the fate of phosphorous and nitrogen in the coastal wetland system. The same modeling system is in the process of being expanded to the west and north to form the TIME domain. This encompasses more of the structural controls in the area and allows for the representation of Shark Slough flows.\n\nThe results of the numerical modeling and scenario testing provide essential information and insight into the flow system and how it responds to the variations in hydrologic input. The computed flows and salinity exchange at the coast are to be used as boundary conditions for circulation models of Florida Bay, which are to be used to assess the effects of systemic changes on biota in the bay. The computed flows also are used to calibrate the regional water management model\u0092s boundary. The nutrient transport simulations will yield information on the effects of various scenarios on nutrient levels in the wetlands and offshore The objectives of this project are to integrate field process studies, represent relevant factors affecting flow in the coastal Everglades, and test restoration alternatives. Field process studies develop all the major factors that affect flow and transport: evapotranspiration, frictional resistance, topography and more. These are used to construct and test the initial surface-water model. Construction of the ground-water model is also dependent on data collected for aquifer parameters and boundaries. This incremental model development is continued by linkage to regional model output for scenario evaluation and the expansion of the SICS model area to create the TIME domain.",
