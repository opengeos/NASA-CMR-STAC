    "description": "The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction with the Biological Resources\nDivision BRD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has implemented a program\nto \"develop a uniform hierarchical vegetation methodology\" at a national level.\nThe program will also create a geographic information system (GIS) database for\nthe parks under its management. The purpose of the data is to document the\nstate of vegetation within the NPS service area during the 1990's, thereby\nproviding a baseline study for further analysis at the Regional or Service-wide\nlevel. The vegetation at Devils Tower National Monument was mapped using\n1:16,000 scale U.S. Forest Service Color Aerial Photography acquired July 29,\n1993. The mapping classification used two separate classification systems. All\nnatural vegetation used the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) as\na base. The vegetation classification was created after extensive on site\nsampling and numerical analysis. The vegetation map units were derived from the\nvegetation classification. Other non-natural or cultural mapping units used the\nAnderson Level II classification system. The mapped area includes a buffer\naround the Monument boundary.\n\nThis mapping effort originates from a long-term vegetation monitoring program\nthat is part of a larger Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) program started by the\nNational Park Service (NPS).  I&M goals are, among others, to map the\nvegetation of all national parks and monuments and provide a baseline inventory\nof vegetation. The I&M program currently works in close cooperation with the\nBiological Resources Division (BRD) of the United States Geological Survey\n(USGS). The USGS/BRD continues overall management and oversight of all ongoing\nmapping efforts in close cooperation with the NPS.\n\nThe purposes of the mapping effort are varied and include the following:\nProvides support for NPS Resources Management. Promotes vegetation-related\nresearch for both NPS and USGS/BRD. Provides support for NPS Planning and\nCompliance. Adds to the information base for NPS Interpretation. Assists in NPS\nOperations.\n\nThe geographic extent of the data set is Devils Tower National Monument and\nabout a 2 mile environs around Monument Boundaries - Black Hills, Wyoming, USA.\n\nInformation was obtained from\n\"http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/deto/metadetospatial.html\" and converted to\nNASA Directory Interchange Format.",
