    "description": "This specific GEOS-5 model configuration used to perform a two-year global,\r\nnon-hydrostatic mesoscale simulation for the period 2005-2007 at 7-km (3.5-km in the future) horizontal resolution.\r\nBecause this simulation is intended to serve as a reference Nature Run for Observing System\r\nSimulation Experiments (OSSEs, e.g., Errico et al., 2012) it will be referred to as the 7-km GEOS-5\r\nNature Run or 7-km G5NR. This simulation has been performed with the Ganymed version of GEOS-\r\n5, more specifically with CVS Tag wmp-Ganymed-4_0_BETA8.\r\nIn addition to standard meteorological parameters (wind, temperature, moisture, surface pressure),\r\nthis simulation includes 15 aerosol tracers (dust, sea-salt, sulfate, black and organic carbon), O3, CO\r\nand CO2. This model simulation is driven by prescribed sea-surface temperature and sea-ice, as well\r\nas surface emissions and uptake of aerosols and trace gases, including daily volcanic and biomass\r\nburning emissions, biogenic sources and sinks of CO2, and high-resolution inventories of\r\nanthropogenic sources.The simulation is performed at a horizontal resolution of 7 km using a cubed-sphere horizontal\r\ngrid with 72 vertical levels, extending up to to 0.01 hPa (~ 80 km). For user convenience, all data\r\nproducts are generated on two logically rectangular longitude-latitude grids: a full-resolution\r\n0.0625o grid that approximately matches the native cubed-sphere resolution, and another 0.5o\r\nreduced-resolution grid. The majority of the full-resolution data products are instantaneous with\r\nsome fields being time-averaged. The reduced-resolution datasets are mostly time-averaged, with\r\nsome fields being instantaneous. Hourly data intervals are used for the reduced-resolution datasets,\r\nwhile 30-minute intervals are used for the full-resolution products. All full-resolution output is on\r\nthe model\u2019s native 72-layer hybrid sigma-pressure vertical grid, while the reduced-resolution\r\noutput is given on native vertical levels and on 48 pressure surfaces extending up to 0.02 hPa.\r\nSection 4 presents additional details on horizontal and vertical grids.
