    "description": "The MYD14A1.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \n\nMODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products are primarily derived from MODIS 4- and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are used to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline.\n\nMYD14A1 is produced every 8 days at 1-kilometer resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. This product is unique in that it has three dimensions: fire-mask (1D) and a maximum fire-radiative-power (2D) are provided for each day (3D) in the 8-day period. For example, the fire-mask contains eight, band-sequential (day), 1200 x 1200 images of fire data representing consecutive days of data collection.\n\nThe Aqua MODIS instrument acquires data twice daily (it crosses the equator locally at 1:30 PM and AM), as does Terra MODIS (it crosses the equator locally at 10:30 AM and PM). These four daily MODIS fire observations serve to advance global monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate.\n\nVersion-5 MODIS Thermal Anomalies & Fire products have attained Validation Stage 3, which was completed using active fire reference data that were derived from ASTER and Landsat-5 TM (30 m resolution) data sources.\n\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees \nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 row /columns \nFile Size: ~0.5 MB \nResolution: 1 kilometer \nProjection: Sinusoidal \nData Format: HDF-EOS \nScience Data Sets (SDSs): 4 + Vdata Table\nTemporal Extent: 2002-07-04 to 2017-03-30",
