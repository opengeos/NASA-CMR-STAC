The temperature reported is determined over the interval, day-of-year (DOY) 106 to DOY 258.\n\nTYPE OF INDICATOR\nThere are three types of indicators used in this report:\n1.Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system;\n2.Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system;\n3.Determine RESPONSES to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.\n\nThis indicator is one of: CONDITION\n\nRATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION\nOver the last century the concentration of greenhouse gases has risen in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases result in warming of the lower atmosphere but enhanced cooling of the upper atmosphere. Enhanced cooling rates of the upper atmosphere may provide a more readily measurable indicator of 'global warming'.\n            \nMidwinter hydroxyl layer temperatures, give a proxy temperature for an altitude of ~87km (just below the coldest region of the atmosphere in winter). Associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases, this tenuous region of the atmosphere is expected to cool, with the magnitude of the cooling being significantly larger than the warming at ground level. When properly measured and interpreted, this may be the atmospheric region where variations in trends associated with anthropogenic climate change can be most rapidly and conclusively determined.\n\nHydroxyl airglow is emitted from an ~8km wide layer, centred at ~87 km.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial Scale: Point value at Davis station, Antarctica\n\nFrequency: Winter averages\n\nMeasurement Technique: Hydroxyl airglow rotational temperatures are determined by the standard technique involving the ratios of the intensity of hydroxyl airglow line emissions.  The difficulties encountered and methods adopted at Davis are detailed in Greet et al., 1998. Refinement to the absolute temperatures determined by this technique have been published by French et al., 2000.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nThe values continue to be refined, though their relative difference between years is well quantified (see error estimates). The potential exists for determining some values at earlier epochs if instrumental uncertainties can be better quantified. This work is underway.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nNoctilucent cloud observations\nPolar statospheric cloud observations\nStratopause region parameters for Davis\nTropospheric and lower stratospheric temperatures\nMonthly averages of daily maximum and minimum temperatures\nMonthly extremes of daily maximum and minimum temperatures\nAtmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas species\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nYear\nTemperature",
