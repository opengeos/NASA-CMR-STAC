    "description": "The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) is an Explorer mission that is\n      being managed by the Office of Space Science Mission and Payload\n      Development Division of the National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration (NASA). The primary purpose of ACE is to determine and\n      compare the isotopic and elemental composition of several distinct\n      samples of matter, including the solar corona, the interplanetary\n      medium, the local interstellar medium, and Galactic matter.\n      \n      The ACE spacecraft measures the flux of charged particles from solar\n      wind energies (300 km/sec) up through galactic cosmic rays (500\n      MeV/nucleon) and the interplanetary magnetic field upstream of\n      earth. The ACE data includes energetic particles from solar wind\n      cosmic ray energies.  In addition, this data set covers both atomic\n      and isotopic composition data for most energy ranges. This pace data\n      is at L1 (approx. 1.5 million km upstream along earth-sun line).\n      \n      ACE browse data are designed for monitoring large scale particle and field\n      behavior and for selecting interesting time periods. The data are automatically\n      generated from the spacecraft data stream using simple algorithms provided by\n      the instrument investigators. They are not routinely checked for accuracy and\n      are subject to revision. Use these data at your own risk, and consult with the\n      appropriate instrument investigators about citing them.\n      \n      Browse parameters are a subset of measurements by the ACE instruments which are\n      created at the Science Center during level one processing. They are delivered\n      to the public domain as soon as possible. Their purpose is to allow monitoring\n      of the solar wind and large-scale particle and magnetic field behavior, and\n      selection of interesting time periods for more intensive study. Interesting\n      time periods might include solar energetic particle events, or the passage of\n      an interplanetary shock. An additional use of the browse parameters is to\n      investigate relationships between the data from the various ACE instruments,\n      and between ACE data and data from other sources.\n      \n      The browse parameters include unsectored fluxes of ions at many different\n      energies and electrons at a few energies. They also include the interplanetary\n      magnetic field, and solar wind parameters such as proton speed and temperature.\n      They therefore furnish a very abbreviated description of what is being observed\n      by the ACE instruments, without the relatively high cost of storing and\n      analyzing all the level one data. Eventually they may be supplemented with\n      event data from the particle detectors, but experience with the flight data is\n      a prerequisite for delivering useful products of that type.\n      \n      See: http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/browse/browse_info.html\n      for more information.",
