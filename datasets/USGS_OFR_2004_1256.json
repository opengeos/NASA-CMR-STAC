    "description": "Lake Mohave is one of several multi-purpose reservoirs that have been\nconstructed on the Colorado River. The lake was formed upon completion of the\nDavis Dam in 1953. Since then, research on this reservoir has dealt primarily\nwith vegetation surrounding the lake (Tallent-Halsell and Walker, 2002), fish\n(Bozek and others, 1990), water quality (Paulson and Baker, 1983), and\ngeological hazards to recreation areas surrounding the lake associated with\nflash floods (Glancy and Harmsen, 1975; Moosburner, 1979; 1981). Because no\nlake-floor mapping had been conducted since completion of the Davis Dam, the\nU.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with researchers from the University of\nNevada Las Vegas, completed a geophysical survey of this lake in April 2002.\nThe survey included collection of sidescan sonar imagery of nearly the entire\nlake floor, and of high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles along widely\nspaced lines throughout the lake. These acoustic data were used to produce\ndetailed maps of the lake floor, which were subsequently used to determine the\namount of sediment that had accumulated in the lake since impoundment, its\ndistribution, and the processes of deposition. Information on sedimentation in\nthe reservoir is needed for several reasons:\n\n(1) sediment diminishes the holding capacity and thus the longevity of the\nreservoir,\n\n(2) sediment can harbor pollutants that may have entered the lake, and\n\n(3) the distribution and types of sediment shed light on the processes of\nsediment dispersal through the lake.\n\nThe survey area extended from Willow Beach nearly to the Davis Dam (fig. 1).\nThe area north of Willow Beach could not be surveyed because it was too narrow\nand shallow for the survey vessel.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
