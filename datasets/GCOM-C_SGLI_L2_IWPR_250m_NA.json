    "description": "GCOM-C/SGLI L2 In-water properties (Chl-a TSM CDOM) (250m) dataset is obtained from the SGLI sensor onboard GCOM-C and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GCOM-C is Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent Orbit sattelite launched on December 23, 2017, which mounts SGLI and conducts long-term global observations of geophysical variables related to the global climate system across 28 items including aerosol and vegetation over 4 areas of atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere. The data will be used to contribute to higher accuracy of global warming prediction. The SGLI has swath of 1150 km in the visible band and 1400 km in the infrared band. Level 2 products are defined to be products composed of physical quantity data that is calculated based on Level 1B products and meteorological data, as well as various additional data related to the physical quantity data.This dataset includes Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLA), Total suspended matter concentration (TSM) and Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM).CHLA data is the concentration of the green pigment in phytoplankton in sea surface level. The physical quantity unit is mg/m^3.TSM data is the dry weight of suspended matter in a unit volume of surface water which is the sum of organic such as phytoplankton and inorganic such as soil. The physical quantity unit is g/m^3.CDOM data is the light absorption coefficient of organics dissolved in surface water at 412 nm. The physical quantity unit is m-1.The product also includes QA_Flag data with the same spatial resolution as the auxiliary data. The provided format is HDF5. The Spatial resolution is 250 m. The projection method is L1B reference coordinates. The generation unit is Scene. The current version of the product is Version 3. The Version 2 is also available, but please note that the \"QA_Flag\" data has been changed.",
