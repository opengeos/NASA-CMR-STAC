    "description": "Surveys were conducted at the eastern and western ends of Heard Island during the 1987/1988 season.  Burrow densities in different habitat types (vegetated and unvegetated) were determined from fixed width transects.  Extensive areas at both ends of the island were surveyed and detailed information was obtained on distribution and abundance on 4 species of burrowing petrels.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 451 (ASAC_451).\n\nThis work also falls under the umbrella project, ASAC 1219 (ASAC_1219).",
