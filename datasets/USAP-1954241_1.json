    "description": "The frequency and severity of hypoxic events are increasing in marine and freshwater environments worldwide with climate warming, threatening the health of aquatic ecosystems and the viability of fish populations. The Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica has historically been a stable, icy-cold, and oxygen-rich environment, but is now warming at an unprecedented rate and faster than all other regions in the Southern hemisphere. Evolution at sub-zero temperatures has equipped Antarctic fishes with traits allowing them to thrive in frigid waters, but has diminished their resilience to warming. Presently little is known about the ability of Antarctic fishes to withstand hypoxic conditions that often accompany warming. This research will investigate the hypoxia tolerance of four species of Antarctic fishes, including two species of icefishes that lack the oxygen-carrying protein, hemoglobin, which may compromise their ability to oxygenate tissues under hypoxic conditions. The hypoxia tolerance of Antarctic fish species will be compared to that of a related fish species inhabiting coastal regions of South America. Physiological and biochemical responses to hypoxia will be evaluated and compared amongst the five species to bolster our predictions of the capacity of Antarctic fishes to cope with a changing environment. This research will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral research fellow. A year-long seminar series hosted by the Aquarium of the Pacific will feature female scientists who work in Antarctica to inspire youth in the greater Los Angeles area to pursue careers in science.",
