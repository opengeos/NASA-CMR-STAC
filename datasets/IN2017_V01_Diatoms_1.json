Continental slope and rise geomorphology seaward of the Totten Glacier, East Antarctica (112\u00b0E-122\u00b0E). Marine Geology.\n\nSamples for diatom analysis were collected on board ship immediately after core recovery. Sub-samples were sent, according to the Australian standard procedures, to the DISTAV sedimentological laboratory in Genoa (Italy) and prepared for the micro-paleontological analysis according to the laboratory\u2019s protocol (imported and tested from Salamanca University lab.; Referring Prof. B\u00e1rcena). Smear-slides and the qualitative-quantitative analyses were performed every 20 cm. Previous onboard smear slides analyses on PC03 highlighted notable variations from the other piston cores, containing some older diatom species. Moreover this core exceptionally did not exhibit a clear cyclicity like the others. It was so assumed to target a condensed sedimentary sequence giving access to older sediments. \nThe further, more in-depth diatom biostratigraphic and quantitative analyses were performed in accordance with the international stratigraphic guide (https://stratigraphy.org/guide/), with the pluri-decennial DSDP and IODP Antarctic diatom biostratigraphic reports and specific papers (see References).  \nSample preparation, diatom species identification and counting were those described in Schrader and Gersonde (1978), Barde (1981 - modified) and Bod\u00e9n (1991). \nDiatom analysis was performed with an immersion 1000x LM Reichert Jung-Polyvar microscope (Wien). Whenever possible, almost 300 diatom valves were counted per slide following the counting methodology presented in Schrader and Gersonde (1978). When diatom concentration proved too low or too concentrated, slides with modified concentrations have been prepared to optimize counting and identification while at least one hundred fields-of-view per poor concentration slide have been analyzed. For samples that were too diatom-poor, the over-concentration of material on the slides resulted in limiting resolution and taxonomic identification of the rare and mostly fragmented valves. Where diatom occurrence was rare only major fragments (&gt;50%) or entire valves were counted. \n\nThe file (.xls) contains 2 sheets:\n\nSheet: PC03 diatoms dataset.\nThe absolute diatom valve concentration (ADA= Absolute Valves Abundance) was then calculated following Abrantes et al. (2005), Warnock &amp; Scherer (2014) and ADA in Taylor\u2010Silva &amp; Riesselmann (2018), taking in account initial weights, concentration of the samples and microscope\u2019s characteristics, as the number of valves per gram of dry sediment. Diatoms were identified to species level following Crosta et al. (2005),  Armand et al. (2005), Cefarelli et al. (2010) for modern assemblages. Older diatom taxa were identified following Gersonde et B\u00e1rcena, 1998, Witkowski et al., 2014; Bohaty et al., 2011; Gombos, 1985; Gombos, 2007; Gersonde et al., 1990; Barron et al., 2004;  Harwood et al., 2001; Harwood etal., 1992. Species were considered extinct when observed stratigraphically higher than extinction boundaries as identified by Cody et al. (2008) but the coexistence or the alternation in the stratigraphic sequence of taxa referring to different biostratigraphic age ranges were considered signs of reworking.\nSheet: PC03 tephra dataset.\nDuring LM microscopic observations some volcanic glass shards were observed first in smear slides and then counted during the activities of microfossils count for diatoms. This allowed to obtain the number of glass shards/g. dry sed. useful to compare with diatom and sediment datasets.\n\nCore location:\nStation_core Longitude Latitude\nA006_PC03 115.043 -64.463\n\nDepth:\nThe core was taken at Site A006 that was chosen into an overbank deposit on the upper western side of a turbidite channel (Minang-a Canyon) (Fig. 39 \u2013 Armand et al., 2017; O\u2019Brien et al., 2020). The setting is at 1862 m depth, shallower respect the other cores. A possible higher energy environment, with a lower sedimentation rate has been first supposed.\n\nTemporal coverage:\nStart date: 2017-01-14 - Stop date: 2018-11-30\n\nReferences:\n\nArmand, L.K., X.
