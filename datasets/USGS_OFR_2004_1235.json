    "description": "The distribution of sedimentary environments presents the limited domain of\ndeposits from \"River Input\", the flood tide wedge of \"Atlantic Sediment\", and\nthe extensive region of indigenous, recycled \"Coastal Erosion Sediment\" in the\nChesapeake Bay littoral environment. Studies by Miller (1982, 1983, 1987) along\nselected reaches of the tidewater Potomac River showed that bluff retreat in\nthe littoral environment could be measured and modeled at as much as 0.5 to 1.0\nm/yr. During the September 18, 2003 Hurricane Isabel storm surge of nearly 3 m,\nas much as 8 to 10 m of coastal erosion was measured near some of Miller's\nsites.\n\nStorm-driven coastal erosion is the most extensive source of Holocene sediment\nin the modern Bay. Although massive amounts were eroded from the terraces and\nuplands during lowered sea level and cold climates, presently most sediment\neroded and transported from terrace and upland source areas has been stored on\nslopes and alluvial bottoms of the Coastal Plain landscapes that surround the\nChesapeake.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
