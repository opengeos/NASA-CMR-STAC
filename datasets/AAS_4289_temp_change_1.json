    "description": "This dataset contains data collected during and after a series of ice deformation experiments. Seven of the experiments are controls, run at a constant temperature of either -2, -7 or -10 degrees celsius, and four involve a change in temperature partway through the experiment. Vertical displacement and temperature data were collected during the experiments, and microstructural data (fabric analyser thin sections) were collected at the conclusion of each experiment.\n    \nThe experimental methods and our interpretations are described thoroughly in Craw, et al. (in prep).\n\nIn folder mechanical_data:\n- One .csv file for each experiment containing a header with information on experimental conditions, and columns of data corresponding to time (hours), vertical displacement (mm), and temperature (degrees celsius) throughout the experiment. This is raw data, there will be points recorded from before weights were added at the beginning of the experiment, and after the temperature was lowered at the end.\n\nin folder microstructural_data:\n- One .mat file for each experiment, containing microstructural data (spatially indexed Euler orientations) formatted to be read by the MTEX toolbox (https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/). There is also a file for an example of the starting material, \"standard\" laboratory ice. These data are converted from the .cis files which are generated by the G50 fabric analyser.\n- One .m script (plot_microstructural_data.m) containing commands for plotting spatial maps, histograms of grain size distribution and pole figures of c-axis orientation from the .mat files in this directory.",
