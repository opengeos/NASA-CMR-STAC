    "description": "As part of  the USGS  Global Change Research effort, the PRISM (Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping) Project has documented the characteristics  of middle Pliocene climate on a global scale.  The middle Pliocene was selected for detailed study because it spans the transition from relatively warm global climates when glaciers were absent or greatly reduced in the Northern Hemisphere to the generally cooler climates of the Pleistocene with expanded Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and prominent glacial-interglacial cycles.\n      \n      The purpose of this report is to document and explain the PRISM2 mid Pliocene reconstruction.  The PRISM2 reconstruction consists of a series of 28 global scale data sets (Table 1) on a 2\u00b0 latitude by 2\u00b0 longitude grid.  As such, it is the most complete and detailed global reconstruction of climate and environmental conditions  older than the last glacial.\n      \n      PRISM2 evolved from a series of studies that summarized conditions at a large number of marine and terrestrial sites and areas (eg. Cronin and Dowsett, 1991; Poore and Sloan, 1996).  The first global reconstruction of mid Pliocene climate (PRISM1)  was based upon 64 marine sites and 74 terrestrial sites and included data sets representing annual vegetation and land ice, monthly sea surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice, sea level and topography on a 2\u00b0x2\u00b0 grid  (Dowsett et al. (1996) and Thompson and Fleming (1996)).  The current reconstruction (PRISM2) is a revision of PRISM1 that incorporates several important differences:\n      \n      1)  Additional sites were added to the marine portion of the reconstruction to improve previous coverage.  Sites from the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean are incorporated for the first time in PRISM2.\n      \n      2)  All Pliocene sea surface temperature (SST) estimates were recalculated based upon a new core top calibration to the Reynolds and Smith (1995) adjusted optimum interpolation (AOI) SST data set.  This reduced some of the problems previously encountered when different fossil groups were calibrated to different modern climatologies (Climate / Long Range Investigation Mapping and Predictions [CLIMAP], Goddard Institute for Space Sciences [GISS], Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR], etc.).\n      \n      3)  PRISM2 uses a +25m rise in sea level for the Pliocene (PRISM1 used +35m), in keeping with much new data that has become available.\n      \n      4)  Although the change in global ice volume between PRISM1 and PRISM2 is minor, PRISM2 uses model results from Prentice (personal communication) to guide the areal and topographic distribution of Antarctic ice.  This results in a more realistic Antarctic ice configuration in tune with the +25m sea level rise.",
