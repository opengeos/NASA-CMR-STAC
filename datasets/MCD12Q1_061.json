    "description": "The Terra and Aqua combined Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) Version 6.1 data product provides global land cover types at yearly intervals (2001-2022). The MCD12Q1 Version 6.1 data product is derived using supervised classifications of MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data. Land cover types are derived from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), University of Maryland (UMD), Leaf Area Index (LAI), BIOME-Biogeochemical Cycles (BGC), and Plant Functional Types (PFT) classification schemes. The supervised classifications then undergo additional post-processing that incorporate prior knowledge and ancillary information to further refine specific classes. Additional land cover property assessment layers are provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for land cover, land use, and surface hydrology.\n \nLayers for Land Cover Type 1-5, Land Cover Property 1-3, Land Cover Property Assessment 1-3, Land Cover Quality Control (QC), and a Land Water Mask are provided in each MCD12Q1 Version 6.1 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* The \"units\" field is missing in the metadata, however, this information can be found in Table 1 of the User Guide.\n* The MCD12Q1.061 land cover data product is derived using supervised classification of MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data. The classification algorithm uses labeled training samples selected globally to represent land cover categories derived under the IGBP, UMD, LAI, BIOME-BGC, and PFT classification schemes. These training samples were selected to represent land classes, best suited over a certain period. However, due to lack of funding, the science team was not able to keep the training database updated over the course of the years, and some of these training sites could well have undergone changes in their land cover characteristics, especially after 2021. Hence users are urged to maintain caution while using the V6.1/MCD12Q1 land cover layers for 2021 and beyond. More information on this known issue can be found in the [Land Data Products Operational Products (LDOPE) Quality Assessment](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/displayissue?id=781).\n* Known issues are described in Section 2.2 of the User Guide.\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=TerraAqua&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The MCD12Q1 Version 6.1 product has a minor fix to UMD Land Cover Class.",
