    "description": "Title: Does zoning contain built-up land expansion? Causal evidence from Zhangzhou City, China.    Research objective: Built-up land zoning is an imporatant policy measure of land use planning (LUP) to contain built-up land expansion in China. We used a difference-indifference model with propensity score matching to estimate the average and annual effect of built-up land zoning on built-up land expansion in Zhangzhou City, China between 2010 and 2020.     Data: Data.dbf contains the varibles of 1662 villages in Zhangzhou Cities in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2020.   XZQDM2 is villages' unique administrative ID;  Area is the land area of village i;  Dis2water is the Euclidean distance from village i to the nearest waterbody;  Dis2coastl is the Euclidean distance from village i to the nearest coastline;  Dis2city is the the Euclidean distance from village i to the city center;  Dis2county is the the Euclidean distance from village i to the nearest county center;  Elevation is the the average elevation within village i;  Dis2road is the the Euclidean distance from village i to the nearest road;  Nei_Built_ is the the area of built-up land (Nei Built.upit) in the neighboring villages of village i in year t;  Treated is a binary variable, Treated = 1 to the villages that were partially or entirely located inside the development-permitted zones, and Treated = 0 to the villages that were entirely located outside the development-permitted zones;  Intensity is the percentage of land that was assigned to the development-permitted zones in village i;   Year represent the year in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2020;  BuLE is the dependent variable, representing built-up land expansion in village i in year t;  Town is town' unique administrative ID.     Method: First, we employed propensity score matching to overcome the selection bias and satisfy the parallel trend  assumption. Second, we built four Difference-in-Difference models to estimate the average and annual effect.",
