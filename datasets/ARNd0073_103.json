    "description": "The polar regions hold large masses of water in the form of\nice, and this ice has a modifying effect on temperature variations.\n\nAn increase in the mean temperature of the Arctic, as has been\npredicted, may result in an intensified melting of the sea ice. While\na compact ice cover absorbs 15-50% of the incoming solar radiation, an\nice free ocean absorbs about 90%. The absorbed radiation causes\nwarming and evaporation. A change in the ice cover may therefore\ndrastically effect the heat budget of the sea surface. This\nillustrates an important self-magnifying effect of the increased heat\nabsorption causing the acceleration of ice melting.\n\nAn increased greenhouse effect due to changes in the gas composition\nof the atmosphere could therefore be monitored by studying the changes\nin the total mass of sea ice in the Arctic.\n\nIce charts of the Barents Sea , with the ice separated in ten ice\nclasses, weekly, from 1966 to 1989. The classes are from open water to\ndense pack ice.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 1\nRaster Name: *.BPIX files - internal format of Norwegian Polar Institute\nRaster \nRaster files received from the Norwegian Polar Institute in their own\ninternal format.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 2\nRaster Name: ArcInfo grids representing sea ice in the barents region\nRaster \nArcInfo grids representing the barents sea ice cover from 1966 to 1989.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 3\nRaster Name: ArcInfo grids for january 1989.\nRaster \nFive ArcInfo grids representing ice coverage in January 1989.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 4\nRaster Name: Arcinfo grid of sea ice for February 1989.\nRaster \nArcInfo grid representing sea ice cover for February 1989.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 5\nRaster Name: ArcInfo grid of sea ice for January - year unknown.\nRaster \nArcInfo grid representing sea ice cover in January - year unknown.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 6\nRaster Name: Arcinfo grid of sea ice\nRaster \nArcInfo grid representing sea ice - date unknown.\nNeed better documentation for this grid - need to know the coverage date.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 7\nRaster Name: ArcInfo grid of sea ice for July and August\nRaster \nArcInfo grid representing sea ice cover for July and August, year unknown.\n\nAttached Raster(s):\n  Member_ID: 8\nRaster Name: ArcInfo grid of minimum sea ice extent for 1989.\nRaster \nArcinfo grid representing minimum sea ice extent for 1989.\n\nMembers informations:\nAttached Vector(s):\n  MemberID: 9\nVector Name: Vector coverages of ice extent\nFeature_type: polygons\nVector \nVector coverages representing ice extent for the years 1966 through to 1989.\n\nMembers informations:\nAttached Vector(s):\n  MemberID: 10\nVector Name: Vector ArcInfo coverages of sea ice extent\nFeature_type: polygons\nVector \nVector coverages representing sea ice extent for the years 1966\nthrough to 1989.\n\nMembers informations:\nAttached Vector(s):\n  MemberID: 11\nVector Name: Clipping area for the barents sea region\nFeature_type: polygon\nVector \nArcInfo clipping vector coverage of the Barents sea region.\n\nMembers informations:\nAttached Vector(s):\n  MemberID: 12\nVector Name: ArcInfo coverage of July-August ice extent\nFeature_type: polygon\nVector \nArcInfo vector coverage representing the ice extent for July and August.\nYear unknown",
