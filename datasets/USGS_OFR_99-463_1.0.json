    "description": "These geospatial data sets were produced as part of a regional precipitation\nfrequency analysis for Oklahoma. The data sets consist of surface grids of\nprecipitation depths for seven frequencies (expressed as recurrence intervals\nof 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, 100-, and 500-years) and 12 durations (15-, 30-, and\n60-minutes; 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-hours; and 1-, 3-, and 7-days).\nEighty-four depth-duration-frequency surfaces were produced from\nprecipitation-station data. Precipitation-station data from which the surfaces\nwere interpolated and contour lines derived from each surface also are\nincluded. Contour intervals vary from 0.05 to 0.5 inch.\n\nData were used from precipitation gage stations with at least 10 years of\nrecord within Oklahoma and a zone extending about 50 kilometers into bordering\nstates. Three different rain gage networks provided the data (15-minute,\n1-hour, and 1-day). Precipitation annual maxima (depths) were determined from\nthe station data for each duration for 110 15-minute, 141 hourly, and 413 daily\nstations. Statistical methods were used to estimate precipitation depths for\neach duration-frequency at each station. These station depth-duration-frequency\nestimates were interpolated to produce continuous grids with grid-cell spacing\nof 2,000 meters. Contour lines derived from these surfaces (grids) were used to\nproduce the maps in the \"Depth-Duration Frequency of Precipitation for\nOklahoma,\" by R.L. Tortorelli, Alan Rea, and W.H. Asquith, U.S. Geological\nSurvey Water-Resources Investigations Report 99-4232. The geospatial data sets\nare presented in digital form for use with geographic information systems.\nThese geospatial data sets may be used to determine an interpolated value of\ndepth-duration-frequency of precipitation for any point in Oklahoma.\n\n[Summary provided by USGS.]",
