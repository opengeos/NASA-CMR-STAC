    "description": "The RSV Aurora Australis V2 \u2013 Casey Resupply and Marine Science Voyage took place from 5 December 2014 to 25 January 2015. The voyage code is v2_201415020. The principal objective of the voyage was to undertake the Casey Resupply and then conduct marine science in the Dalton Polynya and near the Mertz Glacier. \n\nA downwards looking video camera system was fitted to the CTD and operated during most casts. The system was remotely controlled and typically operated only while the CTD was near the bottom although some videos show the complete descent through the water column. \n\nThe video footage for each deployment was labelled as follows:\nVOYAGE_DATE_TIME_SITE.MTS\nWhere:\nVOYAGE = v2_201415020\nDATE = YYYY-MM-DD\nTIME = HHMMUTC (in 24 hr time)\nSITE = the CTD site name (e.g. SiteA5)\n\nDetails on each site, including geographic coordinates and depth, are available in the Marine Data Voyage Report. The underway data from the voyage is available here: https://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/201415020",
