    "description": "Marine seismic reflection data are used to image and map sedimentary\nand structural features of the seafloor and subsurface.  These data\nare useful in mapping faults (such as the San Andreas and Hayward\nFaults) where they pass under the waters of the San Francisco Bay, and\nin assessing other submarine geologic characteristics and features.\nParticularattention was devoted to investigating the offshore\nconfluence of the San Andreas and San Gregorio fault zones.  These\ndata were collected under the auspices of the auspices of the Central\nCalifornia/San Francisco Bay Earthquake Hazards Project of the Western\nCoastal and Marine Geology Program. Further information concerning the\nobjectives and efforts of this project may be found at:\n\"http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/earthquakes/cencal/\"\n\nThis report consists of two-dimensional marine seismic reflection\nprofile data from the San Francisco Bay area.  These data were\nacquired between 1993 and 1997 with the Research Vessels David\nJohnston and Robert Gray.  The data are available in a variety of\nformats, including binary, postscript and GIF image.  Binary data are\nin Society of Exploration Geologists (SEG) SEG-Y format and may be\ndownloaded for further processing or display.  Reference maps and GIF\nimages othe profiles may be viewed with your Web browser. Seismic\nreflection profiles are acquired by means of an acoustic source\n(usually generated electromagnetically or with compressed air), and a\nhydrophone or hydrophone array.  Both elements are typically towed in\nthe waterbehind a survey vessel.  The sound source emits a short\nacoustic pulse, which propogates through the water and sediment\ncolumns.  The acoustic energy is reflected at density boundaries (such\nas the seafloor or sediment layers beneath the seafloor), and detected\nat the hydrophone. As the vessel moves, this process is repeated at\nintervals ranging between 0.5 and 20 meters depending on the source\ntype.  In this way a two-dimensional image of the geologic structure\nbeneath the ship track is constructed.",
