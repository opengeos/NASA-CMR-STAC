    "description": "The MOD11B1.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Terra V5 LST/E L3 Global 1 Km Grid (Short name: MOD11B1) products incorporate 6 km pixels, which are produced daily using the day/night LST algorithm (Wan and Li, 1997). This algorithm extracts average temperatures (in Kelvin) and applies them to a pair of MODIS daytime and nighttime observations. This method yields 1 K accuracy for materials with known emissivities. The six thermal band emissivities are retrieved through the day/night algorithm. The data inputs include the MODIS L1B calibrated and geolocated radiances, geolocation, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, land and snow cover.\r\n\r\nThe V5 MOD11B1 products are a gridded version of the level-2 LST product (MOD11_L2) mapped and projected on 6-kilometer (precisely 5.6 km) Sinusoidal grids. The MOD11B1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, and emissivities from bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32. It also includes daytime and nighttime LSTs generated from the 1-km, band 31 of the level-2 MOD11_L2 product aggregated to 6 km grids.\r\n\r\nThe V5 Terra/MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11B1, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MOD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\n\r\nThe V5 MOD11B1 product\u2019s acquisition range started March 5, 2000 (2000-065), and continue through March 30, 2017. The V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: V005  March 5, 2000 \u2013\r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 200 x 200 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 6 kilometer (actual: 5.6km) \r\nFile Size: ~0.4 MB compressed \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 18",
