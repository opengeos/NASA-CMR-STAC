    "description": "The Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) has WorldView-2 satellite imagery, of the Larsemann Hills, Antarctica, captured 18 January 2011.\n\nThe panchromatic image was orthorectified using ground control points and the RPC coefficients. Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) model the ground-to-image relationship as a third-order, rational, ground-to-image polynomial. The orthorectified image file is called WV2_18Jan2011_p_orc.\nThe orthorectification was initially done using 35 ground control points from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's Survey Control Database. The total RMS error was very high so a subset of 25 of these ground control points was selected based on their attributes and terrestrial images as well as accurate visual selection of corresponding image pixels. The final orthorectification was done using this subset of 25 ground control points.\n   \nThe multispectral image was not orthorectified because the origin (top left) coordinates are different to those of the panchromatic image. The ground control points would need to be re-identified in the multispectral image and the time was not available to do this.\n\nThe processing was done by Angela Bender of the AADC using IDL/ENVI version 4.8.",
