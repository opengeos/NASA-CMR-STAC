    "description": "The Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) and other data were collected in Coastal Waters of California. Data was collected from NOAA Ship RAINIER. The data was collected over a period spanning from March 31, 1994 and April 22, 1994. Data from 3 CTD casts containing 170 records was submitted on one diskette by Capt. Russell Arnold, National Ocean Service, Seattle, WA in WHOI exchange format. Data has been processed and is available in F022-CTD-Hi Resolution file format of NODC.\n\nF022 High-resolution CTD data is collected from high resolution (conductivity-temperature-depth) instruments. As they are lowered and raised in the oceans, these electronic devices provide nearly continuous profiles of temperature, salinity and other parameters. Data values may be subject to averaging or filtering or obtained by interpolation and may be reported at depth intervals as fine as 1 m. Cruise and instrument information, position, date, time and sampling interval are reported for each station. Environmental data at the time of the cast (meteorological and sea surface conditions) may also be reported. The data record comprises values of temperature, salinity or conductivity, density (computed sigma-t) and possibly dissolved oxygen or transmissivity at specified depth or pressure levels. Data may be reported at either equally or unequally spaced depth or pressure intervals.",
