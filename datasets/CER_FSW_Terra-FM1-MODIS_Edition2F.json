    "description": "CER_FSW_Terra-FM1-MODIS_Edition2F is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Monthly Gridded Radiative Fluxes and Clouds Terra Flight Model 1 (FM1) Edition2F data product, which was collected using the CERES-FM1 and the CERES Scanner instruments on the Terra platform. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe Monthly Gridded Radiative Fluxes and Clouds (FSW) product contains regional averages of instantaneous footprint computed fluxes [Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA), surface, and in-atmosphere (profile)], associated TOA observed fluxes, and cloud parameters only for the hours of the satellite overpass. The FSW product contains a month of space and time-averaged CERES data for a single scanner instrument. All instantaneous fluxes from the CERES Clouds and Radiative Swath (CRS) product for a month are sorted by 1-degree spatial regions and by the Universal Time (UT) hour of observation. The mean of the instantaneous fluxes for a given region-hour bin is determined and recorded on the FSW, along with other flux statistics and scene information. The mean adjusted fluxes at the four atmospheric levels defined by CRS are also included for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes. In addition, four cloud height categories are defined by dividing the atmosphere into four intervals with boundaries at the surface: 700-, 500-, 300-hPa, and the TOA. The cloud layers from CRS are put into one of the cloud height categories and averaged over the region. The cloud properties are also column averaged and included on the FSW.\r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions follow the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, the protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
