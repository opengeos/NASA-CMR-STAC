    "description": "South Carolina's Grand Strand is a heavily populated coastal region that\nsupports a large tourism industry. Like most densely developed coastal\ncommunities, the potential for property damage and lost revenues associated\nwith coastal erosion and vulnerability to severe storms is of great concern. In\nresponse to these concerns, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the South\nCarolina Sea Grant Consortium have chosen to focus upon the Grand Strand (the\narcuate strand of beaches between the North Carolina Border and Winyah Bay, SC)\nand adjacent Long Bay as a portion of Phase II of the South Carolina/Georgia\nCoastal Erosion Study (SC/GCES). \n\nPhase I of the SC/GCES (1994 - 1999) focused upon critical areas of erosion\nalong the central portion of the South Carolina coastline. Research conducted\nduring Phase I began to identify how physical processes, inlet-beach\ninteraction, framework geology and shoreline geometry combine to control\npatterns of erosion along the central South Carolina coast. Phase II of SC/GCES\n(1999 - present) was designed to gain a further understanding of the factors\naffecting shoreline change within northern South Carolina and Georgia. Specific\ngoals of the Phase II study include: 1) quantifying historic shoreline change\nand identifying erosional hotspots; 2) mapping geologic framework and\ndetermining its role in the area's coastal evolution; and 3) calculating a\nsediment budget and identifying transport mechanisms within the study area.\n\nIn November 1999, to address the second goal of Phase II of the SC/GCES, the\nUSGS, Coastal Carolina University (CCU) and Scripps Institution of Oceanography\n(SIO) began a program to systematically map the geologic framework within the\nSouth Carolina segment of Long Bay. Data sources used to produce these maps\ninclude high-resolution sidescan-sonar, interferometric sonar swath bathymetry\nand sub-bottom profiling. Surface sediment samples, vibracores and video data\nprovide groundtruth for the geophysical data. The goals of the program include\ndetermining regional-scale sand-resource availability (needed for ongoing beach\nnourishment projects) and investigating the role that inner-shelf morphology\nand geologic framework play in the evolution of this portion of coastal South\nCarolina.\n\nThis report presents preliminary maps generated through integrated\ninterpretation of geophysical data, which detail the geometries of Cretaceous\nand Tertiary continental shelf deposits, show the location and extent of\npaleochannel incisions, and define a regional transgressive unconformity and\noverlying bodies of reworked sediment. Defining the shallow sub-surface\ngeologic framework will provide a base for future process-oriented studies and\nprovide insight into coastal evolution.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
