    "description": "The map and descriptions offer information that may be used for: land-use\nplanning (e.g. selecting land fill sites, greenbelts, avoiding geologic\nhazards), for finding aggregate resources (crushed rock, sand, and gravel), for\nstudy of geomorphology and Quaternary geology. Geologic hazards (e.g.,\nlandslides, swelling soils, heaving bedrock, and flooding) known to be located\nin, or characteristic of some mapped units, were identified.\n\nSurficial deposits in the quadrangle partially record depositional events of\nthe Quaternary Period (the most recent 1.8 million years). Some events such as\nfloods are familiar to persons living in the area, while other recorded events\nare pre-historical. The latter include glaciation, probable large earthquakes,\nprotracted drought, and widespread deposition of sand and silt by wind. At\nleast twice in the past 200,000 years (most recently about 30,000 to 12,000\nyears ago) global cooling caused glaciers to form along the Continental Divide.\nThe glaciers advanced down valleys in the Front Range, deeply eroded the\nbedrock, and deposited moraines (map units tbg, tbj) and outwash (ggq, gge). On\nthe plains (east part of map), eolian sand (es), stabilized dune sand (ed), and\nloess (elb) are present and in places contain buried paleosols. These deposits\nindicate that periods of sand dune deposition alternated with periods of\nstabilized dunes and soil formation.\n\nThirty-nine types of surficial geologic deposits and residual materials of\nQuaternary age are described and mapped in the greater Denver area, in part of\nthe Front Range, and in the piedmont and plains east of Denver, Boulder, and\nCastle Rock. Descriptions appear in the pamphlet that accompanies the map.\nLandslide deposits, colluvium, residuum, alluvium, and other deposits or\nmaterials are described in terms of predominant grain size, mineral or rock\ncomposition (e.g., gypsiferous, calcareous, granitic, andesitic), thickness of\ndeposits, and other physical characteristics. Origins and ages of the deposits\nand geologic hazards related to them are noted. Many lines between geologic\nunits on our map were placed by generalizing contacts on published maps.\nHowever, in 1997-1999 we mapped new boundaries, as well. The map was projected\nto the UTM projection. This large map area extends from the Continental Divide\nnear Winter Park and Fairplay ( on the west edge), eastward about 107 mi (172\nkm); and extends from Boulder on the north edge to Woodland Park at the south\nedge (68 mi; 109 km).\n\nCompilation scale: 1:250,000. Map is available in digital and print-on-demand\npaper formats. Deposits are described in terms of predominant grain size,\nmineralogic and lithologic composition, general thickness, and geologic\nhazards, if any, relevant geologic historical information and paleosoil\ninformation, if any. Thirty- nine map units of deposits include 5 alluvium\ntypes, 15 colluvia, 6 residua, 3 types of eolian deposits, 2\nperiglacial/disintegrated deposits, 3 tills, 2 landslide units, 2 glaciofluvial\nunits, and 1 diamicton. An additional map unit depicts large areas of mostly\nbare bedrock. \n\nThe physical properties of the surficial materials were compiled from published\nsoil and geologic maps and reports, our field observations, and from earth\nscience journal articles. Selected deposits in the field were checked for\nconformity to descriptions of map units by the Quaternary geologist who\ncompiled the surficial geologic map units.\n\nFILES INCLUDED IN THIS DATA SET:\n>denvpoly: polygon coverage containing geologic unit contacts and labels.\n>denvline: arc coverage containing faults.\n>geol_sfo.lin:  This lineset file defines geologic line types in the\n>               geologically themed coverages.\n>geoscamp2.mrk:  This markerset file defines the geologic markers in the\n>                geologically themed coverages.\n>color524.shd:  This shadeset file defines the cmyk values of colors\n>               assigned to polygons in the geologically themed coverages.",

These features are the standard USGS 1:250,000 base map data,\n         including longitude and latitude, numbered UTM (meters), and the\n         Colorado State Coordinate System (feet) grid ticks (21 internal grid\n         tics at 15-minute intervals of longitude and latitude are\n         visible). Supporting information includes a correlation chart of\n         geologic map units, a list of map unit symbols and names, and a small\n         location map that shows the quadrangle location relative to rivers,\n         state boundaries, and locations of 26 published USGS geologic maps\n         (1:250,000 scale) in the Colorado Plateau and western Great\n         Plains.
