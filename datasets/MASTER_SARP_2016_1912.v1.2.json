    "description": "This dataset includes Level 1B (L1B) data products from the MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) instrument collected and developed by the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). The spectral data were collected from flights flown on 2016-06-17 in a NASA ER-2 aircraft over Santa Barbara, California. SARP was an eight-week summer program for junior and senior undergraduate students to acquire hands-on research experience in all aspects of a scientific campaign using airborne science laboratories. The SARP 2016 deployment included one flight with 5 flight tracks. The L1B file format is HDF-4, and L2 products are provided in ENVI and KMZ formats. In addition, the dataset includes flight paths, spectral band information, instrument configuration, ancillary notes, and summary information for each flight, and browse images derived from each L1B data file.",
