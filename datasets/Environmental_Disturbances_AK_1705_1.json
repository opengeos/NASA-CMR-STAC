    "description": "This dataset provides descriptions and photos of environmental conditions that impacted availability to subsistence resources by residents in nine rural communities within the Yukon River basin of Interior Alaska. The data (photos) were collected by citizens (harvesters) residing in the communities while engaged in subsistence harvesting activities. The data include descriptions of the environmental condition captured in the photo, photo date, an explanation of how the condition influenced travel and access to resources, the subsistence activity when the photo was taken, effects of the environmental condition on the participant's safety, and the participant's observations regarding frequency and extent of the condition. A sensitivity metric was derived that incorporated the adaptive capacity of the participants to environmental conditions. The observations are for the period February 2016 - June 2017.",
