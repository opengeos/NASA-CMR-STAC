    "description": "Atmospheric and oceanic molecular hydrogen in the marine boundary layer was monitored from February 25 to March 12 by the RGA3 along the cruise track of R/V Araon from Christchurchto to Christchurch carrying out a series of expeditions in the Antarctic Ridge. The air inlet to the instrument was located at 29 m the foremast and seawater inlet at 7m depth. Both air and water samples were measured once per 45 minutes.\nAtmospheric molecular hydrogen goes up to the stratosphere easyly, and oxidized to H2O. Therefore it plays a key role in the stratospheric ozone chemistry and affects the global climate. Also its measurements in the ocean is very important because the production and removal mechanism in the ocean that is one of the sources of H2 has not been understood yet.",
