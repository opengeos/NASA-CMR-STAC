    "description": "This geologic map is part of a cooperative project between the U.S. Geological\nSurvey and the Kaibab National Forest Service to provide geologic information\nfor the Paradine Plains Cactus (Pediocactus pardinei B,W. Benson) Conservation\nAssessment  and Strategy conducted by the Kaibab National Forest, Williams,\nArizona.  The map area includes part of House Rock Valley and part of the\nKaibab Plateau, sub- physiographic provinces of the Colorado Plateau.  This\npart of the Colorado Plateau was not previously mapped in adequate geologic\ndetail.  This map completes one of several remaining areas where uniform\nquality geologic mapping was needed.  The geologic information in this report\nmay be useful to land management, range management, and flood control programs\nfor all federal and state agencies, and private affairs.\n\nThis digital map database is compiled from unpublished data and new mapping by\nthe authors, represents the general distribution of surficial and bedrock\ngeology in the mapped area.  Together with the accompanying pamphlet, it\nprovides current information on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the\narea.  The database delineate map units thatare identified by age and lithology\nfollowing the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological Survey.  The\nscale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution of the database to\n1:24,000 or smaller.\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (ARC/ INFO\ncoverages) and supporting text and plot files.  In addition, the report\nincludes two sets of plot files (Post Script and PDF format) that will generate\nmap sheets and pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field\nStudies Report.  These files are described in the explanatory pamphlets\n(canegeo.doc, canegeo. pdf, or canegeo.txt).  The base layer used in the\npreparation of the geologic map plot files was derived from a Digital Raster\nGraphic of a standard USGS 7.5' quadrangle.  This raster image was converted to\nGrid format in ARC/INFO, trimmed and rotated, then converted to a GeoTIFF\nimage.  The resultant TIFF image was combined with geologic data to produce the\nfinal map layout in Illustrator 8.0.",
