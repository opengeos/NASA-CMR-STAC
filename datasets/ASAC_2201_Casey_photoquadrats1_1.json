    "description": "A survey of the epibenthic fauna of hard-substrata was made around Casey Station, using a camera mounted on a frame to take photoquadrats. A nested sampling design was used with several spatial scales. At each location there were two sites, approximately 50-100 m apart. At each site there were three by 15 m long transects, approximately 5 m apart. On each transect there were 2 plots, 5 m long by 2 m wide. Six photoquadrats were taken in each plot. This metadata record describes one component of this survey, photoquadrats taken in flat or gently sloping rocky areas, where the bottom consisted of flat bedrock, gravel or cobbles. A separate survey was done in and around boulders and boulder fields. One of the aims of this survey was to determine if there is any evidence of human impacts in these assemblages. There were several control and several potentially impacted locations.\n\nThe data have yet to be analysed.\n\nAlso links to ASAC 1100.",
