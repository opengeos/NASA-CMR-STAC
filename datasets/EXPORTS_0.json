    "description": "EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTeSensing (EXPORTS) is a NASA-led and NSF co-funded science project aiming to understand export and fate of upper ocean net primary production (NPP) using satellite remote sensing, state of the art ocean field measurements, and numerical models. EXPORTS lead a pre-EXPORTS modeling and data-mining activity, followed by two major oceanographic expeditions: EXPORTS North Pacific (EXPORTSNP) and EXPORTS North Atlantic (EXPORTSNA); and it is currently on a final project phase of synthesis and modeling.The EXPORTSNP deployment was conducted at Ocean Station Papa (Station P, nominally 50N, 145W) operated by Canada's Line P time-series sampling program. The EXPORTS 2018 field deployment consisted of four major components: 1) the R/V Roger Revelle (cruise id= RR1813) functioned as the Process Ship, sampling BGC stocks and fluxes, ecological abundances and rates, and optical properties following a Lagrangian float; 2) the R/V Sally Ride(cruise id=SR1012)  was the Survey Ship and characterized spatial variability about the Process Ship on scales from about 1 to 100 km; 4) a heterogeneous array of AUV platforms was deployed to set the spatial center of the sampling program, to provide horizontal spatial and high-temporal information, and to extend the temporal presence in the area; and 4) a long-term sampling presence was created, tying the ship-based observations to climatically relevant time and space scales using BGC floats and partnerships with ongoing research programs.The EXPORTSNA deployment was conducted at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (Station PAP, nominally) in collaboration with the PAP Sustained Observatory (PAP-SO) which is a sustained, multidisciplinary observatory in the North Atlantic coordinated by the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Similar to the North Pacific filed mission, EXPORTSNA consisted of Process Ship represented by the RRS James Cook (cruise id = JC214), a Survey Ship represented by the RRS Discovery (cruise id = DY131), over 40 autonomous assets, and long-term collaboration and observations using BGC floats and partnerships with ongoing research programs. Among the assets, the user will find data from 3 different glider missions (SG219, SG237, SL305), a lagrangian floats (LF092), Neutrally Buoyant Sediment Traps (NBST) floats, Wirewalker, TZEK, and Minions. EXPORTS partnered with the Ocean Twilight Zone (OTZ) program with a third vessel, the R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa (cruise id= SG2105) that join them at the PAP station. EXPORTS funded data were collected aboard SG2105 as well, however, all the data collected is served under the OTZ_WHOI SeaBASS experiment and cruise SG2105. For additional information about the EXPORTS field experiments please refer to Siegel et al., 2021.EXPORTS data funded under NSF can be found in BCO-DMO: https://www.bco-dmo.org/program/757397To find information about all the data collected under EXPORTS and their data repositories and availability, please visit: https://sites.google.com/view/oceanexports/home",
