    "description": "Since the early 1980's the EROS Alaska Field Office (AFO) has been involved in\n      the acquisition, classification, and analysis of digital land cover data over\n      the State of Alaska, and to a limited extent, northwestern Canada and Wrangle\n      Island, Russia. The digital data currently covers approximately 77% of the land\n      and water within the boundaries of the State of Alaska. These data are\n      currently being made available via the AFO web site to land managers and\n      researchers who may be interested in land cover conditions over various\n      portions of Alaska. The land cover maps as a result of digital analysis of\n      Landsat multispectral scanner, Landsat thematic mapper, and SPOT multispectral\n      scanner satellite data. Some data however, are missing from the database due to\n      data degradation on storage media or loss of data tapes, although a limited\n      number of hard copy map products may be in existence, for example, U.S. Forest\n      Service land cover data for southeast Alaska. The land cover data are stored\n      online in a series of directories and are available via the web. Each directory\n      name is indicative of the area for which the land cover data exists. Some\n      directories connote a U.S. Geological Survey 1:250,000 quadrangle (for example,\n      anchorage_int), while others indicate a particular project area (for example,\n      anwr represents Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) or the agency responsible for\n      producing the data. For example, nowitna.fws indicates that the data were\n      produced for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Directories with an '_int'\n      suffix denote that the data correspond to the Interim Landcover Mapping\n      project. Each directory contains five files with the following extensions:\n      .bil, .blw, .hdr, .prj, and .stx. As a group, one or more of the files can be\n      read by most image analysis and GIS software packages. The .bil file contains\n      the binary raster land cover data and the others are ASCII files. The .bil file\n      does not contain any header or footer records, and can be easily imported into\n      image processing software by using the information contained in the .blw and\n      .hdr files. The .blw file provides pixel size information as well as the upper\n      left corner coordinate. The .hdr contains number of rows and columns of the\n      data set, as well as band format (band interleave). The .prj file gives\n      projection information, and the .stx file gives information on minimum/maximum/\n      mean values of the data. Projection parameters for the data sets are either in\n      Universal Transverse Projection (UTM) or Alaska Albers Equal Area Conic.",
