    "description": "Color-shaded and contoured images of global gridded instrumental data\n      have been produced as a computer-based atlas and is available via ftp\n      and as a CD-ROM. The data consists of images depicting anomaly maps of\n      surface temperature, sea level pressure, 500-mb geopotential heights,\n      and percentages of reference period precipitation. Monthly, seasonal,\n      and annual composites are available, in either cylindrical,\n      equidistant, or northern and southern hemisphere polar\n      projections. Temperature maps are from 1854 to 1991, precipitation\n      maps from 1851 to 1989, sea level pressure maps from 1899 to 1991 and\n      500 mb height maps from 1946 to 1991. Documentation is available as\n      README files at the FTP site and on the CD-ROM (Bradley, et al. 1994).\n      \n      The data consists of the following:\n      \n      Temperature Data\n      ----------------\n      The temperature data are distributed on a 5 degree latitude by 5\n      degree longitude grid with 2592 (36 by 72) points in the grid. The\n      data are in the form of monthly, seasonal, and annual anomalies to\n      0.01 degrees C, expressed as departures from a 1950-1979 reference\n      period mean. The data are derived from the following:\n      \n      1) land-based monthly station surface air temperatures from January 1854\n      through December 1991 (Jones, et al. 1991).\n      \n      2) the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) gridded (2 lat by 2\n      long) monthly sea surface temperatures from January 1854 through December 1986\n      (Woddruff et al. 1987).\n      \n      3) the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) gridded (1 lat by 1 long)\n      monthly sea surface temperature dataset with data from January 1987\n      through December 1991 (Bottomley et al. 1990).\n      \n      Precipitation Data\n      ------------------\n      The precipitation data are distributed on a 4 lat by 5 long grid. There are\n      2736 (38 by 72) points in the grid. The data are in the form of seasonal and\n      annual percentages of the reference period (1951-1970) mean precipitation\n      interpolated onto the grid. The orginal source is monthly station precipitation\n      records (1851-1989) from Eischeid et al. (1991).\n      \n      Sea Level Pressure Data\n      -----------------------\n      The sea level pressure data are distributed on a 5 lat by 5 long grid. There\n      are 2520 (35 by 72) points in the grid. The data are in the form of monthly,\n      seasonal, and annual anomalies to 0.1 mb. The anomalies are calculated as\n      departures from a 1951-1980 reference period mean for the Northern Hemisphere\n      and a 1974-1989 reference period mean for the Southern Hemisphere. There is no\n      sea level pressure data between 15 North and 10 South. The original source is\n      from NCAR (Jenne 1975) for the periods 1899-1991 and 1973-1989.\n      \n      500 mb Geopotential Height Data\n      -------------------------------\n      The 500-mb height data are distributed on a 5 lat by 5 long grid. There are\n      2520 (35 by 72) points in the grid. The data are in the form of monthly,\n      seasonal, and annual anomalies to 1 m. The anomalies are calculated as\n      departures from a 1951-1980 reference period mean for the Northern Hemisphere\n      and a 1974-1989 reference period mean for the Southern Hemisphere. There are no\n      height data between 15 North and 10 South. The original source of the data are\n      as follows:\n      \n      1) National Meteorological Center (NMC) Northern Hemisphere octagonal grid data\n      (Jenne 1975) from a compact disc (CD-ROM) produced jointly by the University of\n      Washington and NCAR. The data is from January 1946 through June 1989.\n      \n      2) files of Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere gridded 500-mb heights\n      (5 lat by 5 long) from NCAR. The files contain data from April 1973 through\n      December 1991.\n      \n      All of the data described have been produced as Graphic Interchange\n      Format (GIF) image files (1024 x 822 pixels, 256 color). Shareware for\n      viewing the GIF images (PC, MAC or X-window workstations) are also\n      available at the FTP site. All of the maps were produced using NCAR\n      Graphics Version 3.00.\n      \n      The Atlas is also available as a CD-ROM. The CD-ROM contains the image\n      and documentation files and shareware for viewing the GIF\n      images. Software is for PC, MAC or X-Window workstations.  The CD-ROM\n      is available from Frank Keimig, Department of Geology and Geography,\n      University of Massachussetts, Amherst, MA 01375 (email:\n      frank@geo.umass.edu).\n      \n      More information is available from:\n      \"http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/db1003.html\"\n      \n      NOTE:\n      The Eischied, et al. precipitation data set is available at:\n      \"http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/tr051.html\"",
