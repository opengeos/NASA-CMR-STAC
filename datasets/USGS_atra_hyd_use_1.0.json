    "description": "This dataset is one of eight datasets produced by this study.\nFour of the datasets predict the probability of detecting\natrazine and(or) desethyl-atrazine (a breakdown product of atrazine)\nin ground water in Colorado; the other four predict the probability\nof detecting elevated concentrations of nitrate in ground water in\nColorado. The four datasets that predict the probability of\natrazine and(or) desethyl-atrazine (atrazine/DEA) are differentiated\nby whether or not they incorporated atrazine use and whether\nor not they incorporated hydrogeomorphic regions. The four datasets\nthat predict the probability of elevated concentrations of nitrate\nare differentiated by whether or not they incorporated fertilizer\nuse and whether or not they incorporated hydrogeomorphic\nregions. Each of the eight datasets has its own unique strengths\nand weaknesses. The user is cautioned to read Rupert (2003, Probability\nof detecting atrazine/desethyl-atrazine and elevated concentrations\nof nitrate in ground water in Colorado: U.S. Geological Survey\nWater-Resources Investigations Report 02-4269, 35 p.,\nhttp://water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri02-4269/) to determine if he(she)\nis using the most appropriate dataset for his(her) particular needs.\nThis dataset specifically predicts the probability of detecting\natrazine/DEA in ground water in Colorado with hydrogeomorphic\nregions and atrazine use estimates included. The following text\nwas extracted from Rupert (2003).\n\nDraft Federal regulations may require that each State develop a\nState Pesticide Management Plan for the herbicides atrazine,\nalachlor, metolachlor, and simazine. Maps were developed that the\nState of Colorado could use to predict the probability of detecting\natrazine/DEA in ground water in Colorado. These maps can be\nincorporated into the State Pesticide Management Plan and can help\nprovide a sound hydrogeologic basis for atrazine management in\nColorado. Maps showing the probability of detecting elevated nitrite\nplus nitrate as nitrogen (nitrate) concentrations in ground water in\nColorado also were developed because nitrate is a contaminant of\nconcern in many areas of Colorado.\n\nMaps showing the probability of detecting atrazine/DEA at or greater\nthan concentrations of 0.1 microgram per liter and nitrate\nconcentrations in ground water greater than 5 milligrams per liter\nwere developed as follows: (1) Ground-water quality data were overlaid\nwith anthropogenic and hydrogeologic data by using a geographic\ninformation system (GIS) to produce a dataset in which each well had\ncorresponding data on atrazine use, fertilizer use, geology,\nhydrogeomorphic regions, land cover, precipitation, soils, and well\nconstruction. These data then were downloaded to a statistical\nsoftware package for analysis by logistic regression. (2) Relations\nwere observed between ground-water quality and the percentage of\nland-cover categories within circular regions (buffers) around wells.\nSeveral buffer sizes were evaluated; the buffer size that provided\nthe strongest relation was selected for use in the logistic regression\nmodels. (3) Relations between concentrations of atrazine/DEA and\nnitrate in ground water and atrazine use, fertilizer use, geology,\nhydrogeomorphic regions, land cover, precipitation, soils, and\nwell-construction data were evaluated, and several preliminary\nmultivariate models with various combinations of independent variables\nwere constructed. (4) The multivariate models that best predicted\nthe presence of atrazine/DEA and elevated concentrations of nitrate\nin ground water were selected. (5) The accuracy of the multivariate\nmodels was confirmed by validating the models with an independent\nset of ground-water quality data. (6) The multivariate models were\nentered into a geographic information system and the probability\nGRIDS were constructed.",
