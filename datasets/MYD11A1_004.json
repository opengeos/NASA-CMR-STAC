    "description": "The MYD11A1.004 dataset was decommissioned as of October 24, 2017. Users are encouraged to use Version 6 of MODIS/Aqua Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid SIN (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11a1.006). \n\nThe MODIS/Aqua version-4 (V4) level-3 LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 km SIN Grid product (Short name: MYD11A1) is a gridded version of the level-2 daily LST/E data set, whose LSTs are retrieved by the split-window algorithm. This product is generated by projecting the MYD11_L2 pixels to Earth locations on a Sinusoidal mapping grid. A single tile contains 1200 by 1200 grids in as many rows and columns. The data inputs include the MODIS L1B calibrated and geolocated radiances, geolocation, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, land and snow cover.\n\nThe band 31 and 32 emissivities are estimated by a classification-based emissivity method, which relies on the pixel\u2019s land cover type as determined by the land and snow cover inputs. Until June 2001, the AVHRR-based IGBP land cover product was used. Following that time, MODIS-derived land cover product was used. The estimated emissivities in arid and semi-arid areas are potentially uncertain, and users are advised to exercise caution in their applications.\n\nThe V4 MYD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers: LST, quality control assessment, error estimates, bands 31 and 32 emissivities, zenith angle of the pixel view, observation time, and the geographic coordinates for every five scan lines and samples.\n\nThe V4 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11A1, are validated to Stage-1 with well-defined uncertainties over a range of representative conditions. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\n\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications. Subsequent and improved versions of this product also exist.\n\nThe V4 MYD11A1 product has an acquisition range from July 4, 2002 (2002-185) until January 3, 2007 (2007-003). The V4 collection remains consistent with V41, and users may combine the two collections in a time-series analysis.\n\nV004 Data Set Characteristics: \nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \nFile Size: 24 MB \nResolution: ~1 kilometer (actual: 0.93km) \nProjection: Sinusoidal \nData Format: HDF-EOS \nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 12",
