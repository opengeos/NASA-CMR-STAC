    "description": "The NLDAS-2.0 netCDF data serve as a replacement for all NLDAS-002 GRIB-1 products. The NLDAS-2.0 hourly products are produced in the forward stream (updated daily) with ~4 day latency, while the latest NLDAS-2.0 monthly products will be released around the 6th of the following month. On August 1, 2024, the NLDAS-002 GRIB-1 forward stream will end; all NLDAS-002 GRIB-1 products will be decommissioned and removed from public access on November 1, 2024.  NLDAS-2 users are encouraged to use the updated NLDAS version 2.0 netCDF data, which are currently publicly accessible and will continue to be updated.\n\nThis data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the VIC land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from January 1979 to present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2 monthly Noah model data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly Noah model data, as monthly accumulation for rainfall, snowfall, subsurface runoff, surface runoff, total evapotranspiration, snow melt, and monthly averages for other variables. Each monthly period is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month, with the exception of the very first month in the data set (January 1979), which starts at 00Z 02 January 1979. Also, for the first month (January 1979), since the variables listed as instantaneous in the README file do not have valid data exactly on 00Z 02 January 1979, this one hour is not included in the average for this one month. \n\nA brief description about the NLDAS-2 monthly VIC model data can be found from the dataset landing page for NLDAS_VIC0125_H_002 and the NLDAS-2 README document. \n\nDetails about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the VIC LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). The version of the VIC model for the NLDAS-2 VIC data available from the NASA GES DISC is VIC-4.0.3; this version of the VIC model is the same as used in Sheffield et al. (2003). \n\nThe NLDAS-2 VIC monthly data contain forty-three fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. \n\nFor information about the vertical layers of the Soil Moisture Content (PDS 086), Soil Temperature (PDS 085), and Liquid Soil Moisture Content, please see the README Document or the GrADS ctl file.",
