    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Aerial Photography data set includes over 2.5 million film transparencies.  Beginning in 1937, photographs were acquired for mapping purposes at different altitudes using various focal lengths and film types.  The resultant black-and-white photographs contain less than 5 percent cloud cover and were acquired under rigid quality control and project specifications (e.g., stereo coverage, continuous area coverage of map or administrative units).  Prior to the initiation of the National High Altitude Photography (NHAP) program in 1980, the USGS photography collection was one of the major sources of aerial photographs used for mapping the United States.  Since 1980, the USGS has acquired photographs over project areas that require photographs at a larger scale than the photographs in the NHAP and National Aerial Photography Program collections.",
