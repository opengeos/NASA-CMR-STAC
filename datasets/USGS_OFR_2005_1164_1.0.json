    "description": "A National Volcano Early Warning System NVEWS is being formulated by the\nConsortium of U.S. Volcano Observatories (CUSVO) to establish a proactive,\nfully integrated, national-scale monitoring effort that ensures the most\nthreatening volcanoes in the United States are properly monitored in advance of\nthe onset of unrest and at levels commensurate with the threats posed. Volcanic\nthreat is the combination of hazards (the destructive natural phenomena\nproduced by a volcano) and exposure (people and property at risk from the\nhazards).\n\nThe United States has abundant volcanoes, and over the past 25 years the Nation\nhas experienced a diverse range of the destructive phenomena that volcanoes can\nproduce. Hazardous volcanic activity will continue to occur, and because of\nincreasing population, increasing development, and expanding national and\ninternational air traffic over volcanic regions the exposure of human life\nand enterprise to volcano hazards is increasing. Fortunately, volcanoes exhibit\nprecursory unrest that if detected and analyzed in time allows eruptions to be\nanticipated and communities at risk to be forewarned with reliable information\nin sufficient time to implement response plans and mitigation measures.\n\nIn the 25 years since the cataclysmic eruption of Mount St. Helens, scientific\nand technological advances in volcanology have been used to develop and test\nmodels of volcanic behavior and to make reliable forecasts of expected activity\na reality. Until now, these technologies and methods have been applied on an ad\nhoc basis to volcanoes showing signs of activity. However, waiting to deploy a\nrobust, modern monitoring effort until a hazardous volcano awakens and an\nunrest crisis begins is socially and scientifically unsatisfactory because it\nforces scientists, civil authorities, citizens, and businesses into playing\ncatch up with the volcano, trying to get instruments and civil-defense\nmeasures in place before the unrest escalates and the situation worsens.\nInevitably, this manner of response results in our missing crucial early stages\nof the volcanic unrest and hampers our ability to accurately forecast events.\nRestless volcanoes do not always progress to eruption; nevertheless, monitoring\nis necessary in such cases to minimize either over-reacting, which costs money,\nor under-reacting, which may cost lives.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
