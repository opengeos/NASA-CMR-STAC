    "description": "This EarthCARE collection contains the following data products: \r\rLevel 1b: Fully Calibrated and Geolocated Instrument Science Measurements \r\rLevel 1b data represents the fully processed, calibrated, and geolocated measurements from EarthCARE&apos;s instruments. Each measurement is aligned with the native instrument grid. For the Broadband Radiometer (BBR), measurements are also spatially integrated to various groundpixel sizes. \r\rLevel 1c (MSI only): MSI Level 1b Data Interpolated to a Common Spatial Grid \r\rSpecifically for the Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI), Level 1c data involves interpolating Level 1b measurements onto a standardized spatial grid that is consistent across all MSI bands. This grid closely matches the spacing used in MSI Level 1b data. \r\rLevel 1d: Joint Standard Grid (JSG) for All Instruments with ECMWF Meteorological Fields. \r\rLevel 1d data provides a spatial grid to enable easy collocation and synergistic use of the data from all EarthCARE instruments, named the &quot;joint standard grid.&quot; Additionally, this level incorporates ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) meteorological fields limited to the EarthCARE swath, enabling comprehensive analysis and modelling of atmospheric conditions within the satellite&apos;s coverage area. \r\r \r\rCPR level 1b: C-NOM products is generated and provided by JAXA. This product is used as input, in combination with the X-MET aux file, for different processors in the EarthCARE production chain. \r \r\rAUX_MET_1D: meteorological analysis and forecast fields X-MET provided by ECMWF. This product is used as input, in combination with the C-NOM product, for different processors in the EarthCARE production chain.",
