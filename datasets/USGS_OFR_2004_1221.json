    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the University of New Hampshire\nand the University of New Brunswick mapped the nearshore regions off Los\nAngeles and San Diego, California using multibeam echosounders. Multibeam\nbathymetry and co-registered, corrected acoustic backscatter were collected in\nwater depths ranging from about 3 to 900 m offshore Los Angeles and in water\ndepths ranging from about 17 to 1230 m offshore San Diego. Continuous, 16-m\nspatial resolution, GIS ready format data of the entire Los Angeles Margin and\nSan Diego Margin are available online as separate USGS Open-File Reports.\n\nFor ongoing research, the USGS has processed sub-regions within these datasets\nat finer resolutions. The resolution of each sub-region was determined by the\ndensity of soundings within the region. This Open-File Report contains the\nfiner resolution multibeam bathymetry and acoustic backscatter data that the\nUSGS, Western Region, Coastal and Marine Geology Team has processed into GIS\nready formats as of April 2004. The data are available in ArcInfo GRID and XYZ\nformats. See the Los Angeles or San Diego maps for the sub-region locations.\n\nThese datasets in their present form were not originally intended for\npublication. The bathymetry and backscatter have data-collection and processing\nartifacts. These data are being made public to fulfill a Freedom of Information\nAct request. Care must be taken not to confuse artifacts with real seafloor\nmorphology and acoustic backscatter.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
