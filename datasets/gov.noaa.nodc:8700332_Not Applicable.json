    "description": "These data are part of the Southern California OCS Baseline Study funded by BLM and submitted by Science Applications, Inc. Coastal areas along southern California were sampled. Following is a list of purpose for which the study was conducted, the period when the data was collected and the type of data collected.\n\nSampling was done from July 1, 1975 to November 6, 1977 to obtain depth, temperature and salinity profiles. During the same time period data was collected to measure the amounts of particulate organic carbon (poc), dissolved organic carbon (doc), and ATP.\n\nAnalysis was done for intertidal hydrocarbon (hc) concentrations from July 1, 1975 to June 30, 1978. Fractions analyzed include aliphatic and aromatics, pristane and phytane, iso-n and branched hydrocarbons, odd/even preference, and the hexane, benzene and methane fractions.\n\nAnalysis was done for benthic hydrocarbon (hc) concentrations from July 1, 1975 to November 6, 1977. Fractions analyzed include aliphatic and aromatics, pristane and phytane, iso-n and branched hydrocarbons, odd/even preference, and the hexane, benzene and methane fractions.\n\nSampling was done to assess the trace metal concentrations from July 1, 1975 to November 6, 1978. Benthic fauna, sediments and the water column were analyzed for Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V, Zn and Al concentrations.\n\nSampling was done to assess the trace metal concentrations from July 1, 1975 to November 6, 1978. Intertidal rocky and sandy fauna, and sediments were analyzed for Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V, Zn and Al concentrations.\n\nBenthic coastal sediments along southern California were sampled from July 1, 1975 to November 6, 1977. The analysis includes sediment age, grain size, total organic carbon (toc), total inorganic carbon (tic), total carbon (tc), calcium carbonate content and mineral composition, as well as a description of the field conditions during sampling. Identical analysis was conducted on samples collected during July 1, 1975 to June 30, 1978.\n\nIntertidal coastal sediments along southern California were sampled from July 1, 1975 to June 30, 1978. The analysis includes sediment age, grain size, total organic carbon (toc), total inorganic carbon (tic), total carbon (tc), calcium carbonate content and mineral composition, as well as a description of the field conditions during sampling.\n\nCoastal areas along southern california were sampled from July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1978 and the composition of the benthic microfauna and benthic macrofauna was analyzed.\n\nCoastal areas along southern California were sampled from July 1, 1975 to June 30, 1978. Data includes files describing the biotic/abiotic mussel community and a species dictionary as well as a description of the field conditions.\n\nRocky coastal beaches along southern California were sampled from July 1, 1975 to June 30, 1978 and the composition of the intertidal rocky fauna was analyzed. Included in these data is a file on rocky intertidal fauna succession and a description of the field conditions.\n\nSandy coastal beaches along southern california were sampled from uly 1, 1975 to June 30, 1978 and the composition of the sandy intertidal fauna was analyzed.",
