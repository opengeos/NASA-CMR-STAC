    "description": "A series of ice compression tests were carried out by Jo Jacka in 1977, and again by J.S.Birch in 1979-82, all aimed at determining how ice reacted under different circumstances. For each series of experiments, five different \"Box Hill\" rigs were set up, and kept at -10C (1977) or -30 (1979) for the duration of the experiments. The experiments in 1977 came to an early end when the cold room being used failed.\n\nThe setup and method for each experiment, along with the results, were recorded in log books and have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nLogbook(s):\nGlaciology Box Hill Compression Rig Experiments, Book 1 - Initial notes on setup, and recordings of early results for the 1977 experiments.\n\nGlaciology Box Hill Compression Rig Experiments, Book 2 - More results from 1977.\n\nGlaciology Ice Compression Logbook - Setup and results for the 1979 experiments.",
