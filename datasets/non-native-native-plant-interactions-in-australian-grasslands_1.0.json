Non-native Eragrostis curvula reduces plant species diversity in pastures of South-eastern Australia even when native Themeda triandra remains co-dominant. Plants 10, 596._    __Please cite this paper together with the citation for the datafile.__      Study area  The study was conducted in the lowland grassy woodlands of the Bega Valley Region, which is located in the south-east corner of New South Wales, Australia. Embedded between the Pacific Ocean and the Australian Alps, the lowland grassy woodlands are mostly located on granitic substrates and reach elevations of roughly 500 m above sea level. Typically, these grassy woodlands receive less precipitation (mean annual precipitation between 700-1100 mm) compared to the more elevated areas that surround them (NSW Government - Office of Environment and Heritage 2017).   The vegetation is dominated by an open tree canopy layer consisting of Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm, Angophora floribunda Sm. (Sweet) and a range of other eucalypt species. Sometimes shrub or small trees are also present, whereas grasses and forbs form the ground-cover. In areas without intensive agricultural history, this layer is dominated by perennial, tussock grasses such as Themeda triandra Forssk, Microlaena stipoides R.Br (Weeping Grass), Eragrostis leptostachya Steud. (Paddock Lovegrass) and Echinopogon ovatus P.Beauv (Forest Hedgehog Grass). The remaining inter-tussock spaces are occupied by a diversity of growth-restricted grasses and herbaceous forbs (NSW - Department of Planing, Industries and Environment 2019; NSW Government - Office of Environment and Heritage 2017).   Clearing, pasture sowing, fertilizer application and livestock grazing resulted in a dramatic decrease in the extent of these natural woodlands, with less than five percent within conservation reserves and overall, with only about 20% of their original extent in New South Wales still existing (Tozer et al. 2010). The remaining areas outside of reserves are threatened by altered fire frequencies, habitat clearing, livestock grazing and especially by non-native plant invasion, particularly Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees. For this reason, the grassy woodlands are listed as an endangered ecological community in the NSW state legislation. Additionally, they are considered as critically endangered by the Commonwealth of Australia (Threatened Species Scientific Committee (TSSC) 2013).    Experimental design and sampling  The study was conducted on six farms and in each of them two sites were chosen, representing a paired design. One of the sites at each farm is dominated by native Themeda triandra, the other one co-dominated by non-native Eragrostis curvula and Themeda triandra. All farms are within a radius of approximately 10 km from the town Candelo. Three of the farms are located North (36\u00b040\u2019 to 36\u00b042\u2019 S and 149\u00b038\u2019 to 149\u00b042\u2019 E) and three of them are located South (36\u00b051\u2019 to 36\u00b049\u2019 S and 149\u00b038\u2019 to 149\u00b042\u2019 E) of Candelo.   Non-native herbivores (mainly cattle, sheep and rabbits) and native herbivorous marsupials (mainly kangaroos, wallabies and wombats) are present in the area of these sites. On each site, data was collected within four plots (each 1 x 1 m) in May and November 2020. All plant species found within a plot were recorded and their relative abundance was estimated.
