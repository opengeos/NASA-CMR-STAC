    "description": "A multitude of physical and biological processes on which ecosystems and human societies depend are governed by climatic conditions. Understanding how these processes are altered by climate change is central to mitigation efforts. Based on mechanistically downscaled climate data, we developed a set of climate-related variables at yet unprecedented spatiotemporal detail as a basis for environmental and ecological analyses. We created gridded data for near-surface relative humidity (hurs), cloud area fraction (clt), near-surface wind speed (sfcWind), vapour pressure deficit (vpd), surface downwelling shortwave radiation (rsds), potential evapotranspiration (pet), climate moisture index (cmi), and site water balance (swb), at a monthly temporal and 30 arcsec spatial resolution globally starting 1980 until 2018. At the same spatial resolution, we further estimated climatological normals of frost change frequency (fcf), snow cover days (scd), potential net primary productivity (npp), growing degree days (gdd), and growing season characteristics for the periods 1981-2010, 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100, considering three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP370, SSP585) and five Earth system models. Time-series variables showed high accuracy when validated against observations from meteorological stations. Climatological normals were also highly correlated to observations although some variables showed notable biases, e.g., snow cover days (scd). Together, the data sets presented here allow improving our understanding of patterns and processes that are governed by climate, including the impact of recent and future climate changes on the world\u2019s ecosystems and associated services to societies.",
