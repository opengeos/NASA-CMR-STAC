    "description": "Gravity and seismic data from Tule Desert, Meadow Valley Wash, and California\nWash, Nevada, provide insight into the subsurface geometry of these three\nbasins that lie adjacent to rapidly developing areas of Clark County, Nevada.\nEach of the basins is the product of Tertiary extension accommodated with the\ngeneral form of north-south oriented, asymmetrically-faulted half-grabens.\nGeophysical inversion of gravity observations indicates that Tule Desert and\nMeadow Valley Wash basins are segmented into subbasins by shallow, buried\nbasement highs. In this study, basement refers to pre-Cenozoic bedrock units\nthat underlie basins filled with Cenozoic sedimentary and volcanic units. In\nTule Desert, a small, buried basement high inferred from gravity data appears\nto be a horst whose placement is consistent with seismic reflection and\nmagnetotelluric observations. Meadow Valley Wash consists of three subbasins\nseparated by basement highs at structural zones that accommodated different\nstyles of extension of the adjacent subbasins, an interpretation consistent\nwith geologic mapping of fault traces oblique to the predominant north-south\nfault orientation of Tertiary extension in this area. California Wash is a\nsingle structural basin. The three seismic reflection lines analyzed in this\nstudy image the sedimentary basin fill, and they allow identification of faults\nthat offset basin deposits and underlying basement. The degree of faulting and\nfolding of the basin-fill deposits increases with depth. Pre-Cenozoic units are\nobserved in some of the seismic reflection lines, but their reflections are\ngenerally of poor quality or are absent. Factors that degrade seismic reflector\nquality in this area are rough land topography due to erosion, deformed\nsedimentary units at the land surface, rock layers that dip out of the plane of\nthe seismic profile, and the presence of volcanic units that obscure underlying\nreflectors. Geophysical methods illustrate that basin geometry is more\ncomplicated than would be inferred from extrapolation of surface topography and\ngeology, and these methods aid in defining a three-dimensional framework to\nunderstand groundwater storage and flow in southern Nevada.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
