    "description": "Thirteen species of fish have so far been caught in the inshore waters around the Vestfold Hills, including the Rauer Islands, in depths down to approximately 100 m. Species caught depend markedly on the type of fishing gear used, but three species are clearly dominant numerically. Pagonthenia bernacchii is most abundant in the shallower (less than 20 m deep) weedy and rocky habitats, while Chionodraco hamatus is dominant in the deeper (greater than 20 m deep) nearshore troughs and further offshore. Pagonthenia borchgrevinki occupies the specialised habitat associated with sea ice and close-inshore areas, including fjords and Burton Lake. The species list from the Vestfold Hills area is similar to lists from comparable locations in East Antarctica except for the major difference that C. hamatus has not yet been recorded from such shallow waters at the other locations, while P. bernacchi and P. hansoni are much more abundant in water deeper than 20 m at those sites than at Davis.
