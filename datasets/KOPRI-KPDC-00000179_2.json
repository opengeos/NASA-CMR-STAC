    "description": "In order to study the nutrients and phytoplankton pigment distribution in n the Chukchi and Canada Basin, samples were collected in 38 stations. Stations were chosen based on physio-chemical characteristics of the water environment. We investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the micro nutrients nitrate+nitrite, silicate, ammonium, and phosphate in the study area. Dissolved inorganic nitrate+nitrite concentrations remained low throughout the most region and some stations concentrations were found to be just above the level of detection. Dissolved inorganic phosphate and silicate shows maximum concentration in 200~300m depths. In general there was an excellent agreement between chlorophyll a, phytoplankton accessory pigment distribution, and nutrients distribution. The phytoplankton community structure assumed by phytoplankton pigment analysis show that the distinct succession of dominant phytoplankton group within the study area might related to nutrients availabilities.\r\n1) Phytoplankton community structure study using phytoplankton pigment analysis\r\n2) The effect of physical environments on the nutrients and phytoplankton pigment distribution",
