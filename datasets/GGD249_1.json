    "description": "Snow and soil temperature records for January 1988 - May 1996 are presented. Included are snow depth and weight measurements, snow density (calculated), active layer depth in the frost tubes, weight of wet and dried soil samples from unknown depth within the active layer (water content calculated), and soil temperature at the surface (0.05 cm) and to the depths of 3 to 4 meters at 3 sites. The sites are 1) on a road covered by 1 m of gravel underlain by clay; 2) outside a building on piles, (sensors are placed 1 to 2 m from the building wall); and 3) under the building between piles. In addition, air temperature was measured inside the building or between the piles (documentation is not clear on this point.) There are several gaps in temperature measurements (January 1991 to May 1992). These data are presented on the CAPS CD-ROM version 1.0, June 1998.\n\nAir temperature, wind direction, and temperature were measured at 5, 20, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm below the tundra surface at an undisturbed site; and at 5, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 cm, and 3 m and 8 m below the concrete surface of a building. Incoming radiation, outgoing radiation, temperature of the heat flux instrument, global radiation, heat flux, wind speed, wind speed maximum, average wind speed, and temperature inside the building were measured since 1993 with data loggers. All data are recorded for July 1987 - February 1996.",
