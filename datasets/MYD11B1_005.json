    "description": "The MYD11B1.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua LST/E L3 Global 1 km Grid (Short name: MYD11B1) products incorporate 6 km pixels (4.63 km pixels for versions prior to V005), which are produced daily using the day/night LST algorithm (Wan and Li, 1997). This algorithm extracts average temperatures (in Kelvin) and applies them to a pair of MODIS daytime and nighttime observations. This method yields 1 K accuracy for materials with known emissivities. The six thermal band emissivities are retrieved through the day/night algorithm. The data inputs include the MODIS L1B calibrated and geolocated radiances, geolocation, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, land and snow cover\r\n\r\nThe MYD11B1 products are a gridded version of the level-2 LST product (MYD11_L2) mapped and projected on 6-kilometer (precisely 5.6 km) Sinusoidal grids. The MYD11B1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, and emissivities from Bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32. It also includes daytime and nighttime LSTs generated from the 1-km, Band 31 of the level-2 MYD11_L2 product aggregated to 6 km grids.\r\n\r\nThe V5 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11B1, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\r\n\r\nZhengming, Wan, and Li Zhao-Liang. \"A Physics-Based Algorithm for Retrieving Land-Surface Emissivity and Temperature from EOS/MODIS Data.\" Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on 35, no. 4 (1997): 980-96.\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\n\r\nThe V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.  Please refer to the LP DAAC MODIS product table at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/myd11b1  for additional detailed product version information.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 200 x 200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~0.4 MB compressed\r\nResolution: ~6 kilometers (actual 5.6 km)\r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 18\r\nTemporal Range: 2002-07-08 to 2017-03-31",
