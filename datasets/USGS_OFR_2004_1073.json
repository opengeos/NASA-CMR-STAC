    "description": "During 2002, a baseline study of hydrologic conditions was conducted, and\nselected features were mapped within the Mt. Pisgah campground on the Blue\nRidge Parkway in Haywood County, North Carolina. Field surveys were performed\nby using global positioning system equipment one time (January 2002) during the\nstudy to locate hydrologic and other types of features in the study area.\nWater-level and streamflow data and seasonal water-quality samples were\ncollected from a stream that receives all surface-water drainage from the\ncampground area. During 2002, water levels (stage) in the stream ranged from\n1.09 to 1.89 feet above gage datum (4,838.06 to 4,838.86 feet above mean sea\nlevel). Flow in the stream ranged from 0.05 to 9.7 cubic feet per second.\nAnnual daily mean flow for calendar year 2002 was approximately 0.35 cubic foot\nper second (about 226,000 gallons per day). Samples collected from the stream\nhad low concentrations of all constituents measured. Four compounds associated\nwith human activity (camphor, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (the insect repellent\nDEET), tributylphosphate, and methylsalicylate) were detected in the stream\nsamples; however, concentrations were less than detection levels. Stream\nsamples collected in April and September and analyzed for fecal coliform\nbacteria had densities of 76 and 110 colonies per 100 milliliters of water,\nrespectively. No violations of water-quality standards were noted for any\nconstituent measured in the stream samples.\n\nSeven shallow ground-water wells were installed near a natural area in the\ncenter of the campground. Ground-water levels measured periodically in these\nwells and in two existing shallow piezometers generally were highest in the\nspring and lowest in the fall. Water temperature, pH, and specific conductance\nwere measured in samples collected from the shallow wells in April and\nSeptember 2002. Measured pH values were consistently lowest in samples from two\nwells on the west side of the natural area and highest in samples from the well\nlocated near the center of the natural area. Specific-conductance values\nmeasured in samples from wells on the east side of the natural area were lower\nthan those measured in samples from the other wells. Specific-conductance\nvalues measured in samples from two wells on the west side and from one well\nnear the center of the natural area generally were two to three times higher\nthan the specific-conductance values measured in samples from wells on the east\nside of the natural area.\n\nSamples for fecal coliform bacteria were collected from six wells on September\n11, 2002. The fecal coliform densities in samples from most of the wells were\nless than or equal to 8 colonies per 100 milliliters. Samples from two of the\nthree wells on the west side of the natural area had coliform densities of 16\nand 480 colonies per 100 milliliters.\n\nOther ground-water samples collected on September 11 and September 24 were\nanalyzed with a spectrophotometer in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) North\nCarolina District Office for nitrate concentrations only. From the samples\ncollected on September 11, estimated nitrate concentrations of 1 milligram per\nliter or less were detected in three wells, two on the west side and one on the\neast side of the natural area. Nitrate was not detected with a\nspectrophotometer in any of the ground-water samples collected on September 24.\nIndicator test strips also were used in the field to screen for nitrate and\nnitrite in ground-water samples collected on September 24. Nitrate was detected\nby test strips in one well on the west side of the natural area, with estimated\nconcentrations of 1 milligram per liter or less indicated. Nitrite was not\ndetected by the test strips in samples collected from any of the wells.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
