    "description": "The MOD11A1.041 dataset was decommissioned as of October 30, 2017. Users are encouraged to use Version 6 of MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid SIN (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod11a1.006). \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Terra version-041 (V41) products use a modified version-4 (V4) LST algorithm and version-5 (V5) data inputs. The V41 products primarily address underestimation problems in the V5 Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) products. Recent validation activities reveal that the V5 CMG products underestimate LSTs up to 6K especially in desert and semi-arid regions. The production date for this collection starts with MODIS/Terra data acquisition from 2007-001. This beginning date is driven by the availability of the MODIS V5 data inputs (level-1B radiance data, geolocation data, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, and land and snow cover data).\r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Terra V41 LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid (Short name: MOD11A1) products incorporate 1 km pixels, which are produced daily using the generalized split-window LST algorithm. This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of atmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into tractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in bands 31 and 32 are estimated from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe V41 Terra/MOD11A1 products are projected in a Sinusoidal grid by mapping the level-2 LST product (MOD11_L2) on 1 km (precisely 0.928 km) grids. The MOD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and bands 31 and 32 emissivities from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe V41 MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11A1, are validated to Stage-2. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the MODIS land team validation site referenced under the \"Links\" section.\r\n\r\nThe V41 MOD11A1 product\u2019s acquisition range id January 3, 2007 (2007-001) through March 30, 2017 (2017-003). The LST products from 2007-001 will remain consistent with similar products from V4, and hence are amenable to combine them in a time series analysis. Users should exercise caution, and not mix the V4.x (i.e., V4 and V41) and V5 LST products in their analysis.\r\n\r\nV041 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: V041 January 3, 2007 \u2013 Current\r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nSpatial Resolution: ~1 kilometer \r\nMap Projection: Sinusoidal \r\nFile Size: ~2.2 MB \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 12",
