    "description": "In order to investigate the structure of phytoplankton communities, physical environmental factors and chlorophyll a, this study was carried out at 14 stations from August 20 to August 25, 2005 in the Kara Sea. Water temperature and salinity were influenced under the Ob River. Concentrations of total microphytoplankton, and nano-picophytoplankton chlorophyll a were higher at surface than those of SCM depth. Phytoplankton dominant species were nano-picophytoplankton such as Cryptomonas sp., Dinobryon belgica. Phytoplankton communities were composed of 25 taxa representing diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophyceae, silicoflagellate, prasinophyceae and prymnesiophyceae in surface. The most abundant species was picophytoplankton in all station except station 2, but the second was variable. Phytoplankton standing crops ranged from minimum 8.4\u00d7105cells \u2113-1 to maximum 1.7\u00d7107cells \u2113-1 in surface and 6.2\u00d7105 cells \u2113-1 to maximum 1.7\u00d7107 cells \u2113-1 in SCM depth\n1) To investigate on physical biodiversity, species composition, abundance and dominant species of phytoplankton communities in the Kara Sea\r\n2) To study on taxonomic research and dominant species of phytoplankton communities for investigate on indicator species",
