    "description": "PRELIM: The data set contains inventory of corner reflectors installed in Northern Alaska, USA, as part of the NASA SnowEx Alaska field campaigns. Corner reflectors (CRs) are objects with known response characteristics to radar returns. CRs are installed in situ and used to calibrate or study radar returns from airborne and spaceborne imagery. CRs were deployed in SnowEx Alaska field campaign study areas for two purposes. First, CRs were deployed in SnowEx study areas for the purpose of calibrating the radar imagery and producing backscatter measurements as precisely as possible; these are referred to as \u201cengineering corner reflectors\u201d. Second, an array of twenty CRs was also deployed in one of the SnowEx study areas for the purpose of studying the interaction between radar and forests; these are referred to as \u201cscience corner reflectors\u201d.",
