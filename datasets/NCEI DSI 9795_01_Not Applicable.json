    "description": "The Climatic Diagnostics Database, DSI-9795, is a historical data set created by the Climate Analysis Center using global climatic data from the period October 1, 1978 through September 30, 1983. The Climate Diagnostics Database contains monthly averages of selected fields from the National Meteorological Center's (NMC; now National Centers for Environmental Prediction, NCEP) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS). The major parameters are monthly averages of the following elements for constant pressure levels of 1000-, 850-, 700-, 500-, 300-, 250-, 200-, 100-, and 50-millibars: 1. U (West/East) component of wind (meters/second), 2. V (South/North) component of wind (meters/second), 3. Temperature (Deg. K), 4. Geopotential height (geopotential meters), 5. Vertical velocity (millibars/second), 6. Specific humidity (grams/kilogram) 7. Vorticity (seconds-1), 8. Pressure (millibars), 9. Sums squared of U (West/East) component of wind (meters/second), 10. Sums squared of V (South/North) component of wind (meters/second), 11. Sums squared of temperature (K), 12. Sums squared of geopotential height (geopotential meters). 13. Sums squared of vertical velocity (millibars/second), 14. Sums squared of specific humidity (grams/kilogram), 15. Sums squared of vertical velocity (seconds-1), 16. Sum of cross product UV wind components (m2s-2), East-West transport of poleward momentum, 17. Sum of cross product U and temperature (ms-1K), East-West transport of heat, 18. Sum of cross product U and geopotential height (ms-1gpm), East-West transport of mass, 19. Sum of cross product U and vertical velocity (mmbs-2), East-West transport of vertical momentum, 20. Sum of cross product U and specific humidity (mgs-1Kg-1), East-West transport of moisture, 21. Sum of cross product U and vorticity (ms-2), East-West transport of relative vorticity, 22. Sum of cross product V and temperature, North-South transport of heat, 23. Sum of cross product V and geopotential height (ms-1gpm), North-South transport of mass, 24. Sum of cross product V and vertical velocity (mmbs-2), North-South transport of vertical momentum, 25. Sum of cross products V and specific humidity (mgs-1Kg-1), North-South transport of moisture, 26. Sum of cross products V and vorticity (ms-2), North-South transport of relative vorticity, 27. Stretching of vortex tubes (s-2).",
