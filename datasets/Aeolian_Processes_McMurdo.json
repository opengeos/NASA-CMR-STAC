    "description": "This dataset contains data collected during studies of boundary layer winds and\n      surface characteristics.  These field experiments were designed to:\n      1.      Understand and quantify the partitioning of wind shear stress between\n      surface and roughness elements on (a) rocky surfaces and (b) surfaces with\n      scatted rocks and intervening sand surface.\n      2.      Test the Raupach et al (1993) shear stress partitioning model to\n      estimate the entrainment threshold on surfaces covered with isolated roughness\n      elements\n      3.      Quantify the spatial distribution of surface shear stress on surfaces\n      with scatted rocks and an intervening sand surface.\n      4.      Understand relations between shear stress partitioning and transport of\n      sand.\n      \n      The dataset includes measurements of:\n      - Boundary Layer winds and surface shear stress\n      - Wind speed at 6 heights above the surface (6.00 m, 3.65 m, 2.22 m, 1.35 m,\n      0.82 m, 0.50 m wind direction at 6 m and 0.82 m, temperature at 3.65 m.\n      - Surface shear stress using Irwin sensors (Wyatt and Nickling, 1997)\n      - Sand mass transport rates at the Victoria Valley site with static (Nickling\n      and McKenna Neuman, 1997) and automated sand traps.\n      Saltation intensity with Sensit sensor at the Victoria Valley site (Gillette\n      and Stockton, 1986)\n      - Wind force on simulated roughness elements using the Guelph force balance\n      (Gillies et al., 2000; Grant and Nickling, 1998; Wyatt and Nickling, 1997). \n      \n      Data were sampled every 1 second and averaged for 1, 5, and 10 minute\n      intervals.\n      \n      Derived data include estimates of wind shear velocity (u*), aerodynamic\n      roughness (zo)\n      \n      Surface characterization data: \n      Information on rock cover and roughness element  geometry, and sand grain size\n      and sorting parameters for surface sand and sand in transport in the Victoria\n      Valley is also available.\n      \n      Datasets available:\n      Data were obtained for 2 sites located on the north side of Lake Fryxell and in\n      the Victoria Valley.  There is also Irwin sensor calibration data for 2 sites:\n      Wright Valley and Victoria Lower Glacier, which includes wind profile and\n      temperature measurements.  \n      Data cover the following periods:\n      - Wright Valley: January 11-14, 2002\n      -  Lake Fryxell: January 15 - February 1, 2002; January 15 - February 3, 2003\n      - Victoria Lower Glacier: January 11-13, 2003\n      - Victoria Valley: January 15 - 31, 2003.\n      \n      Site locations are:\n      - Lake Fryxell: 77 degrees 36.252 minutes; 163 degrees 07.827 minutes\n      - Wright Valley: 77 degrees 31.363 minutes; 162 degrees 00.472 minutes\n      - Victoria Valley:  77.366009935 degrees S, 162.320035048 degrees E\n      \n      These studies were funded by NSF grant OPP-0088136\n      \n      References cited\n      \n      Gillette, D.A. and Stockton, P.H., 1986.
