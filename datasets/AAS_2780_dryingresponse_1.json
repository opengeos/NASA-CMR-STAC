    "description": "We compared the drying responses of clumps of moss from Casey Station, Antarctica, evaluating the changes in mass, water content, photosynthesis (measured by chlorophyll fluorescence), cellular solute concentration (measured by differential scanning calorimetry) and cellular dimensions. \n    \nDrying was performed at different temperatures and VPDs to evaluate the relative impacts of temperature and humidity on moss physiology.\n\nThis dataset is comprised of several spreadsheets (all in comma separated values format). The primary data sheet (Moss-desiccation tolerance Master Datasheet.csv) compiles the overall experimental data, including means derived from several other data sheets. \n\nMoss-fluorescence Datasheet.csv reports data from Walz MaxiPAM chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of moss clumps at each timepoint.  \n\nMoss-fluorescence micro Datasheet.csv reports data from Walz Microscope PAM chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of individual leaves and shoots sampled at each timepoint and kept under oil to retain hydration.  \n\nMoss-meas Datasheet.csv reports the dimensions (area, perimeter, length and width) of cells from individual leaves sampled at each timepoint and kept under oil to retain hydration. \nSolute concentration of the shoots was determined by performing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on shoots sampled at each timepoint. \n\nTo convert the melting/freezing points measured to concentrations requires calibration, the data for which are provided in Moss-DSC calib.csv.\n\nThe data are laid out with columns for each variable considered, and rows for each sample. The columns for each spreadsheet are as follows:\n\nMoss-desiccation tolerance Master Datasheet.csv:\nDate-date of experiment\nRun-experimental run (1 to 18)\nClumpSp-dominant species of moss clump: C-Ceratodon purpureus;
