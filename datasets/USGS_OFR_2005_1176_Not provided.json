    "description": "The Androscoggin River flooded the town of Canton, Maine in December 2003,\nresulting in damage to and (or) evacuation of 44 homes. Streamflow records at\nthe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow-gaging stations at Rumford (USGS\nstation identification number 01054500) and Auburn (01059000) were used to\nestimate the peak streamflow for the Androscoggin in the town of Canton for\nthis flood (December 18-19, 2003). The estimated peak flood streamflow at\nCanton was approximately 39,800 ft3/s, corresponding to an estimated recurrence\ninterval of 4.4 years; however, an ice jam downstream from Canton Point on\nDecember 18-19 obstructed river flow resulting in a high-water elevation\ncommensurate with an open-water flood approximately equal to a 15-year event.\nThe high water-surface elevations attained during the December 18-19 flood\nevent in Canton were higher than the expected open-water flood water-surface\nelevations; this verified the assumption that the water-surface elevation was\naugmented due to the downstream ice jam.\n\nThe change in slope of the riverbed from upstream of Canton to the impoundment\nat the downstream corporate limits, and the river bend near Stevens Island are\nprincipal factors in ice-jam formation near Canton. The U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers Ice Jam Database indicates five ice-jam-related floods (including\nDecember 2003) for the town of Canton: March 13, 1936; January 1978; March 12,\n1987; January 29, 1996; and December 18-19, 2003. There have been more\nice-jam-related flood events in Canton than these five documented events, but\nthe exact number and nature of ice jams in Canton cannot be determined without\nfurther research.",
