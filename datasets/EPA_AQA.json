    "description": "The Air Quality Atlas is a collection of maps prepared by the Air Quality\nAnalysis Section in the Region 6 office of the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA). The atlas presents a spatial analysis of air quality in EPA\nRegion 6 for 1996, focusing on the six criteria pollutants for which the EPA\nhas set primary and secondary standards to protect public health and welfare.\nThese standards, defined as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS),\nhave been set for the following six pollutants: lead, nitrogen dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and small particles less than or equal to 10\nmicrons in aerodynamic diameter (PM-10). The primary standards are set to\nprotect public health, and the secondary standards are set to protect public\nwelfare, such as buildings, forests, and agricultural crops. The primary and\nsecondary standards are currently identical for all of the criteria pollutants\nexcept sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide secondary standard is based on a\nthree hour averaging time, while the primary standard is based on both 24-hour\nand annual averaging times.\n\nThe maps show Region 6 air quality levels referenced against the standards set\nfor the six criteria pollutants. The legend for each map, except for the two\nexceedance day maps, was constructed to show the following information: (1) The\nblue shade depicts levels less than 10% of the standard; (2) the green shade\ndepicts levels between 10-50% of the standard; (3) the gray shade depicts\nlevels between 50-90% of the standard; (4) the yellow shade depicts levels\nwithin 10% of the standard; and (5) the red shade depicts levels over the\nstandard. Counties not shaded (white) either do not contain monitors, or their\nmonitors did not achieve a data capture rate of at least 75% (exception - all\nozone site data were reported). The data used to compose each map were obtained\nfrom the EPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) data base.\n\nAnalysis of the maps reveals that all Region 6 monitors recorded concentrations\nbelow the NAAQS set for lead, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Indeed, a\nsignificant amount of areas in Region 6 recorded maximum concentrations well\nbelow these standards. Additional map analysis shows that one Region 6 county\n(El Paso) contained monitors recording measurements above the carbon monoxide\n8-hour standard, that two Region 6 counties (El Paso and Dona Ana) contained\nmonitors recording measurements above the PM-10 standards, and that every state\nexcept Arkansas had at least one monitor with values above the ozone standard.\nFollowing each map displaying the 1996 Region 6 status of particulate and ozone\nair quality is a map showing the number of days per county in which a monitor\nrecorded concentrations above the PM-10 or ozone standards.\n\n[Summary provided by the EPA.]",
