    "description": "### UAV-derived DSMs and orthoimages    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  (UAV) surveys were conducted between 2015 and 2016 on the __Sankt Annafirn__, __Findelen-__ and __Griesgletscher__, situated in the __Swiss Alps__. Three surveys at the Sankt Annafirn allowed for a full glacier coverage,  four  surveys at Griesgletscher allowed an almost full glacier coverage and seven surveys at Findelengletscher allowed for a partial coverage of the glacier tongue (see individual datasets for exact extent). For each survey, a __high resolution orthoimage__ and a __Digital Surface Model (DSM)__ was created.    ### UAV surveys:    Prior flight, Ground Control Points (GCPs) were deployed on the glacier surface and measured with a differential GPS (Trimble R7 or Leica GPS 1200). They allowed precise georeferencing of the UAV-derived datasets. UAV flight plans were planned with the software *eMotion 2* and a SenseFly eBee was used as surveying platform. The images were then processed with the software Agisoft Photoscan Pro 1.1.6 .    The location and dates of each survey can be found in the table together with the number of flights performed (Nflights), the number of acquired images (Nimages), the number of GCPs set (NGCPs) and the surveyed area.    A folder for each dataset is available (see folder name in table), which contains:    - An orthoimage  __*glacier_date_photoscan_oi_CH1903+_LV95_0.1m.tif*__    - A Digital Surface Model  __*glacier_date_photoscan_dsm_CH1903+_LV95_0.1m.tif*__    - The Agisoft Photoscan automatic processing report   __*glacier_date_photoscan_report.pdf*__    where:    - __*glacier*__ is the name of the surveyed glacier    - __*date*__ is the date of the UAV image acquisition    - __*photoscan*__ is the name of the photogrammetric software    - __*oi*__ or __*dsm*__ the type of dataset    - __*CH1903+_LV95*__ is the coordinate system and datum of the dataset    - __*0.1m*__ is the resolution of the dataset in meter    - __*.tif*__ is the extention of the dataset    &nbsp;    Details about the UAV surveys, the image processing and the accuracy of the UAV-derived products can be found in this publication below.    __Paper Citation:__   > _Gindraux et al. 2017.
