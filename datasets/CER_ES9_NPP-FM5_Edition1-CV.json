    "description": "CER_ES9_NPP-FM5_Edition1-CV is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)-like Monthly Regional Averages from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP), CERES Flight Model 5 (CERES-FM5) Edition1-CV data product. Data for this product is collected by way of the CERES-FM5 instrument on the Suomi-NPP platform. Data collection for this product is complete. \r\n\r\nNote: Edition1-CV data are for instrument validation purposes only and not suited for science publications. \r\n\r\nCER_ES9_NPP-FM5_Edition1-CV data are CERES instrument Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA) fluxes using algorithms identical to those used by ERBE, regional averages of instantaneous footprint TOA fluxes only for the hours of satellite overpass (from ES-8 Level 2 product). Edition1-CV data are for instrument validation purposes only and not suited for science publications.The ERBE-like Monthly Regional Averages (ES-9) product contains a month of space and time averaged Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for a single scanner instrument. The ES-9 is also produced for combinations of scanner instruments. All instantaneous shortwave (SW) and long-wave (LW) fluxes at the TOA from the CERES ES-8 product for a month are sorted by 2.5-degree spatial regions, by day number, and by the local hour of observation. The mean of the instantaneous fluxes for a given region-day-hour bin is determined and recorded on the ES-9 along with other flux statistics and scene information. For each region, the daily average flux is estimated from an algorithm that uses the available hourly data, scene identification data, and diurnal models. This algorithm is like the algorithm used for ERBE. The ES-9 also contains hourly average fluxes for the month and an overall monthly average for each region. These average fluxes are given for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes.\r\n\r\nCERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful ERBE mission. The first CERES instrument, protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
