    "description": "NOTE:  This database has been taken offline, as it was no longer maintained.  A copy of the data that was stored in the database is available for download from the provided URL.\n\nThe database holds all known cosmic ray data from the worldwide network of observatories that observed Ground Level Enhancements.\n\nThe Cosmic Ray program contributes to our understanding of the radiation environment in space near the Earth. Radiation constantly bombards the Earth from space and is measurable at and below the surface of the Earth. The high energy particles are detected at the Mawson cosmic ray laboratory with large detectors located on the surface and in an underground vault. This is the only system of its type in polar regions and gives a unique view of the radiation effects. Variations in the radiation are constantly monitored. The sun plays a major role in generating the changes. The radiation levels are important to spacecraft and crew and to high altitude aircraft flying on polar routes. There is also some evidence that the radiation may influence climate.",
