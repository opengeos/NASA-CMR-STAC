    "description": "This data set contains three ASCII data files (.txt format), one for net primary production (NPP) component data and two for climate data. The NPP studies were conducted in a tropical montane forest in the Sierra de Merida at San Eusebio (8.62 N 71.35 W) in northwestern Venezuela. The forest is mostly primary in character, with some selective logging having taken place in the past. Biomass, litterfall, and nutrient content of above- and below-ground vegetation and soil were determined in 1973-1974.\r\n\r\nStanding stocks of biomass and nutrients are reported as the mean of 13 plots with contrasting soil types, slope, and relief. Litterfall is reported as the mean determined for 3 of these plots, measured bi-weekly over the course of one year. Root turnover was estimated by correlation with leaf litter turnover (13%), and woody turnover was estimated by assuming the system to be in steady-state. A minimum estimate of total NPP (1,497 g/m2/year) may be obtained by summing total litterfall (697 g/m2/year), woody turnover (480 g/m2/year), and fine root turnover (320 g/m2/year). The forest contains high mineral stores, accumulated especially in the woody compartment. N and P values are very high in the soil compartment.\r\n\r\nLong-term climate data are available for Merida (8.60 N 71.18 W), about 30 km southeast of the study site. Mean annual temperature is 18.9 C and mean annual precipitation is 1,752 mm, giving a humid/sub-humid climate. Short-term weather observation recorded at the study site are also provided in the data set.",
