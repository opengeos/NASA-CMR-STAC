    "description": "The purpose of this data layer was to provide a base layer of water features at\n      a statewide level for riparian/aquatic species distribution modeling for the\n      Wyoming Gap Analysis project. However the data may also be used for a variety\n      of other natural resources management/biological studies at the appropriate\n      scale.\n      \n      Hydrographic features for Wyoming at 1:100,000-scale, including perennial and\n      intermittent designations and Strahler stream order attributes for streams.\n      Does not include man-made ditches, canals and aqueducts. The data was\n      originally produced by USGS, a Digital Line Graph (DLG) product, though this\n      product was enhanced (edgematched, some linework and attributes corrected,\n      stream order attribute added).\n      \n      A subset of this dataset is also available for distribution, including only\n      major streams (order 4 to 7) and major lakes and reservoirs. In order to reduce\n      the size of this subset, the line segments were dissolved to remove unncessary\n      segments.\n      \n      Both datasets are available in Arc export file and shapefile format for\n      download\n      \n      Statewide and tiled data: there is one export file, which when imported into\n      ARC/INFO, will contain one coverage with both polygon (lakes, reservoirs) and\n      line (streams) topology and two feature attribute files (.PAT and .AAT) along\n      with three additional attribute files containing descriptive information. In\n      shapefile format, there will be two shapefiles (polygons and lines separated),\n      with all attribute files in Dbase format.",
