    "description": "The 35mm photos were taken by Dr Jenny Scott between December 2003 and February 2004 using two Nikon FM-2 SLR cameras with 50mm and 28mm lenses.  The photos are part of a longterm fixed-point photo-monitoring project, started as part of ASAC Project 1181 (ASAC_1181), and the majority of image locations are the same as for the photo series taken by Scott between 1986-2000 (HI_VEG_PHOTOPOINTS_1). The photos serve as a baseline for documenting vegetation and landscape change, both between the two existing time series 1986-2000 and 2003-04, and in the future.\n\nArea covered: eastern and southern Heard Island from Fairchild Beach (Compton Lagoon) to Long Beach.\n\nNumber of images: 1633, ranging between 1-3 MB. Images are stored in seven zip files, according to location.  For more information, see metadata notes (word doc) accompanying the images.\n\nZip files cover the locations as follows:\n- Fairchild Beach (FB). 181 images. Includes north side of Brown Lagoon.\n- Skua Beach (SK). 313 images.  Includes North Skua and Scarlet Hill.\n- Stephenson Moraine (SP). 143 images.\n- Spit North (SN) and SpitSouth (SS). 309 images.\n- Paddick Valley (PV) and Winston Lagoon east (WE). 203 images.\n- Capsize Beach (CB) and Winston Lagoon west (WL). 193 images.\n- Long Beach, Lavett Bluff, Lambeth Bluff (LB). 291 images.\n\nFor each main location (ie each zip-file) there are folders with 28mm images (wide-angle) and folders with 50mm images (standard view) of basically the same series of photo-points. They are called eg. 'Skua 28mm', 'Skua 50mm'. The 28mm images can be viewed first to give an overall impression, and the 50mm images of selected sites can be viewed to give greater detail.  The photo-points are arranged in approximate numerical order in each series of 28mm folders and 50mm folders.  Note that the 28mm and 50mm series do not always match up completely; not all image series are repeated with 50mm and several images may be 50mm only.  The majority of photo-points consist of a series of images (both 28mm and 50mm) forming a panorama progressing from left to right.\n\nPhoto-point location shapefiles:\n\nThere are two shapefiles showing location of DGPS photo-points and handheld GPS photo-points.  The handheld GPS unit was used on several occasions when the DGPS system was unavailable.  Image labels eg. JJS-SK-001 and JJS_SK_001 signify the same photo-point.  For information on labelling, see metadata notes (word doc) accompanying the images.",
