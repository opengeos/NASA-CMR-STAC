    "description": "A Multi University Research Initiative was funded to study the biological response to the dynamic, polarized light field in distinct water types. During June 2010, a campaign was undertaken in the coastal waters off Port Aransas, Texas to study the angular/temporal distribution of polarization in multiple environment types (eutrophic sediment laden coastal waters, oligotrophic off-shore), as well as the polarization-reflectance responses of several organisms. In addition to radiometric polarization measurements, water column IOPs, Rrs, benthic reflectance, and pigment concentration measurements were collected. Later campaigns expanded this research in the coastal waters off the Florida Keys.",
