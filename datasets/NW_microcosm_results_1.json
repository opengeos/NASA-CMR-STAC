    "description": "Geochemical, microbial and 14C data on remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in Antarctica.\nThis record is part of ASAC project 1163 (ASAC_1163).\nMicrocosm study using Old Casey petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sediment investgating the effect of water, nutrients and freze/thaw cycles on biodegradation. Temperature range -4 to 28 degrees. Microcosms with three different levels of nutrients and three different levels of water were investigated.  The experiment was run over 95 days.\nDegradation was traced by radiometric methods and total aliphatic hydrocarbons were measured by gas chromatography.\nRadiometric data in file radiometric_01.xls, Gas Chromatography data in file gc_01.xls.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 1163 (ASAC_1163).\n\nThe radiometric spreadsheet is divided up as follows:\nCODES is a summary of what went into each microcosm.\nCALCULATIONS is how much nutrients, water, radioactivity was added to the sediment.\nSUMMARY is what went into each microcosm flask.\nCT1, CT2 etc is the raw data, what was measured and calculations of radioactivity and recovery of isotope.\n\nNote that the Evaporation flasks (i.e., E10a) the number refers to the temperature that the flasks were incubated at, 'a' and 'b' refer to duplicates.\n\nAVERAGE is the average recoveries and first order rates of the triplicate microcosm for each treatment. GRAPHS is the graphs.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nDays\nHours\nInitial flask weight\nNaOH removed\nNaOH added\nWeight of NaOH (g)\nCount (dpm)\nDiscarded dpm's\nVolume NaOH (ml)\ndpm in trap\nAbsolute dpm's\n%dpm recovered\nmillimole octadecane mineralised",
