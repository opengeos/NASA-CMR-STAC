    "description": "Aerial photography was acquired in January 2010 from a remote controlled helicopter at three locations - Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 135, Robinson Ridge and near the Red Shed at Casey. In addition, highly accurate terrain data (points) was collected at each area using differential GPS. A detailed Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was generated for each area using the terrain data. \nThe point data included the locations of small metal tags glued to rocks used for locating nearby quadrats. The quadrats have been used for long term monitoring of vegetation at ASPA 135 and Robinson Ridge. The quadrats were established in 2002/03 under AAS Project 1313 and have been monitored at approximately five yearly intervals under this project and the subsequent AAS Project 4036 (Chief Investigator: Professor Sharon Robinson, University of Wollongong).\nNear the Red Shed, an outline of the moss beds, streamlines and the general edge of the melt lake were captured using differential GPS.\nAt Robinson Ridge, streamlines and the snowline were captured using differential GPS.\nThe GPS data has an estimated horizontal accuracy of 2 cm.\nA georeferenced mosaic was created from the aerial photography for each area.\n\nASPA 135 dataset: \naspa135dem - DEM in ESRI grid format\naspa135shade - hillshade in ESRI grid format, derived from aspa135dem ASPA135_quadrat_markers - shapefile with the locations of the quadrat markers ASPA135_roversall - shapefile with all the differentially corrected GPS data\nASPA135_UAVmosaic2010 - georeferenced aerial photograph mosaic\n\nCasey Red Shed dataset: \nredsheddem - DEM in ESRI grid format\nredshedshade - hillshade in ESRI grid format, derived from aspa135dem\nUAVphoto_2010 - georeferenced aerial photograph mosaic RedShed_lake - shapefile with the general edge of the melt lake RedShed_moss_outline - shapefile with the 'outline' of the moss beds (quite a conservative outside edge) RedShed_streamline - shapefile with the streamlines RedshedWetness - Topographic wetness index in PCRaster format\n\nRobinson Ridge dataset:\nRobbos_quadrat_markers - shapefile with the locations of the quadrat markers Robbos_rover_all - shapefile with all the differentially corrected GPS data\nRobbos_mosaic2010 - georeferenced aerial photograph mosaic Robbos_snowline - shapefile with the snowline Robbos_streams - shapefile with the streamlines\n\nThe above three datasets also include an ArcMap document displaying the data.\n\nFor further information see the paper\nLucieer, A., Robinson, S., and Turner, D.
