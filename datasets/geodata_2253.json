    "description": "Grey water footprint \u2013 The grey water footprint of a product is an indicator of freshwater pollution that can be associated with the production of a product over its full supply chain. It is defined as the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on existing ambient water quality standards. It is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the water remains above agreed water quality standards. \n\nWater footprint of national consumption \u2013 Is defined as the total amount of fresh water that is used to produce the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of the nation. The water footprint of national consumption can be assessed in two ways. The bottom-up approach is to consider the sum of all products consumed multiplied with their respective product water footprint. In the top-down approach, the water footprint of national consumption is calculated as the total use of domestic water resources plus the gross virtual-water import minus the gross virtual-water export.\n\n\nWater footprint of national production \u2013 Another term for the \u2018water footprint within a nation\u2019:  Water footprint within a nation  Is defined as the total freshwater volume consumed or polluted within the territory of the nation.",
