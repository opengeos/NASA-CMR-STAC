    "description": "The Digital Surface Model (DSM) was created by Dr Arko Lucieer of TerraLuma (http://www.terraluma.net/) and the University of Tasmania for the Terrestrial and Nearshore Ecosystems research group at the Australian Antarctic Division (TNE/AAD).\nAn orthophoto was also created. See the metadata record 'Orthophoto of the biopiles and nearby area at Casey, derived from aerial photographs taken with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), 10 February 2013' with ID 'casey_biopiles_ortho_2013'.\n\nThe products were requested for Australian Antarctic Science Project 4036: \nRemediation of petroleum contaminants in the Antarctic and subantarctic.\nThe products were created from digital photos taken on the 10th February, 2013, with a Canon EOS 550D  from a Mikrokopter Oktokopter piloted by Arko Lucieer and Zybnek Malenovsky. \nThe products were georeferenced to ground control points surveyed using differential GPS by Dr Daniel Wilkins of TNE/AAD.\nRaw photo metadata: ISO-400, Focal Length 20mm, f/6.3 Exposure Time 1/1250 sec.\nHorizontal Datum: ITRF2000.",
