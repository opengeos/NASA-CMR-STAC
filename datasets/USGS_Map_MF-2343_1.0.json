    "description": "The geologic map of the upper Parashant Canyon area covers part of the Colorado\n      Plateau and several large tributary canyons that make up the western part of\n      Arizona's Grand Canyon.  The map is part of a cooperative U.S. Geological\n      Survey and National Park Service project to provide geologic information for\n      areas within the newly established Grand Canyon/Parashant Canyon National\n      Monument. Most of the Grand Canyon and parts of the adjacent plateaus have been\n      geologically mapped; this map fills in one of the remaining areas where uniform\n      quality geologic mapping was needed.  The geologic information presented may be\n      useful in future related studies as to land use management, range management,\n      and flood control programs for federal and state agencies, and private\n      concerns.\n      \n      This digital map database is compiled from unpublished data and new mapping by\n      the authors, represents the general distribution of surficial and bedrock\n      geology in the mapped area.  Together with the accompanying pamphlet, it\n      provides current information on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the\n      area.  The database dilineate map units that are identified by age and\n      lithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\n      Survey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution of the\n      database to 1:31,680 or smaller.\n      \n      This report consists of a set of geologic map database files (ARC/ INFO\n      coverages) and supporting text and plot files.  In addition, the report\n      includes two sets of plot files (Post Script and PDF format) that will generate\n      map sheets and pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field\n      Studies Report.  These files are described in the explanatory pamphlets\n      (para.eps, para.pdf, or para.txt).  The base layer used in the preparation of\n      the geologic map plot files was derived from four Digital Raster Graphic\n      versions of standard USGS 7.5' quadrangles.  These raster images where\n      converted to Grid format in ARC/INFO, trimmed and seamed together, then\n      converted to a GeoTIFF image.  The resultant TIFF image was combined with\n      geologic data to produce the final map image in Illustrator 8.0.",
