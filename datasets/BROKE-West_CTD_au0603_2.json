    "description": "Oceanographic measurements around the 'BROKE-West' survey area along the Antarctic continental margin between 30 degrees and 80 degrees south were conducted aboard Aurora Australis cruise au0603 (voyage 3 2005/2006, 2nd January to 12th March 2006). A total of 120 CTD vertical profile stations were taken, most to within 15 m of the bottom. Over 2500 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate+nitrite, silicate and ammonia), 18O, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, particulate organic carbon/nitrogen/silicate, dimethyl sulphide, and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Full depth current profiles were collected by an LADCP attached to the CTD package, while near surface current profile data were collected by a ship mounted ADCP. Data from the array of ship's underway sensors are included in the data set. \n\nThis report describes the processing/calibration of the CTD and ADCP data, and details the data quality. An offset correction is derived for the underway sea surface temperature and salinity data, by comparison with near surface CTD data. LADCP data are not discussed in this report. Note that the data processor was not a cruise participant, thus this report does not describe all details of the shipboard field data collection or the problems encountered.  CTD station positions are shown in Figures 1a and b, while CTD station information is summarised in Table 1. Niskin bottle sampling at each station is summarised in Table 2. (see word document detailed below for figures and tables)\n\nFurther information is available in a word document available as part of the download.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2655 and 2679 (ASAC_2655, ASAC_2679).",
