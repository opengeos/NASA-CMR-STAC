    "description": "The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 1999-2001. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops.\n\nNet Production Index Number (PIN) base 1999-2001\n\nPresents Net Production (Production - Feed - Seed) indices. All indices are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Net production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 1999-2001average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 1999-2001. Indices are calculated from net production data presented on a calendar year basis.\n",
