    "description": "SCAR_B_G8_FIRE data are Smoke/Sulfates, Clouds and Radiation Experiment in Brazil, GOES-8 ABBA Diurnal Fire Product (1995 Fire Season) data.Smoke/Sulfates, Clouds and Radiation - Brazil (SCAR-B) data include physical and chemical components of the Earth's surface, the atmosphere and the radiation field collected in Brazil with an emphasis in biomass burning. SCAR-B, the third SCAR experiment, was completed in September 1995, studied the effects of biomass burning on atmospheric processes and aids in the preparation of new techniques for remote sensing of these processes from space.The objectives for the SCAR mission are: to advance our knowledge of how the physical, chemical and radiative processes in our atmosphere are affected by sulfate aerosol and smoke from biomass burning; to improve our expertise at remotely sensing smoke, water vapor, clouds, vegetation and fires; and to assess the effects of deforestation and biomass burning on tropical landscapes.The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has produced diurnal GOES-8 derived fire products for the 1995 fire season (June-October 1995) with version 5.5 of the GOES-8 Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (ABBA). The diurnal fire products were produced for 1145, 1445, 1745, and 2045 UTC coinciding with peak burning hours.The GOES-8 Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (ABBA) fire products are derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-8 imager radiances from bands 1 (visible), 2 (3.9 micron), and 4 (11 micron).",
