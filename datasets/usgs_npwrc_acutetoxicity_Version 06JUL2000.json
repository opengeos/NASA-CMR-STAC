    "description": "Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the acute toxicity of three\nammonia-based fire retardants (Fire-Trol LCA-F, Fire-Trol LCM-R, and Phos-Chek\n259F), five surfactant-based fire-suppressant foams (FireFoam 103B, FireFoam\n104, Fire Quench, ForExpan S, and Pyrocap B-136), three nitrogenous chemicals\n(ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite) and two anionic surfactants (linear\nalkylbenzene sulfonate [LAS] and sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) to juvenile\nrainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in soft water. The descending rank order of\ntoxicity (96-h concentration lethal to 50% of test organisms [96-h LC50]) for\nthe fire retardants was as follows: Phos-Chek 259F (168 mg/L) > Fire-Trol LCA-F\n(942 mg/L) = Fire-Trol LCM-R (1,141 mg/L). The descending rank order of\ntoxicity for the foams was as follows: FireFoam 103B (12.2 mg/L) = FireFoam 104\n(13.0 mg/L) > ForExpan S (21.8 mg/L) > Fire Quench (39.0 mg/L) > Pyrocap B-136\n(156 mg/L). Except for Pyrocap B-136, the foams were more toxic than the fire\nretardants. Un-ionized ammonia (NH3; 0.125 mg/L as N) was about six times more\ntoxic than nitrite (0.79 mg/L NO2-N) and about 13,300 times more toxic than\nnitrate (1,658 mg/L NO3-N). Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (5.0 mg/L) was about\nfive times more toxic than SDS (24.9 mg/L). Estimated total ammonia and NH3\nconcentrations at the 96-h LC50s of the fire retardants indicated that ammonia\nwas the primary toxic component in these formulations. Based on estimated\nanionic surfactant concentrations at the 96-h LC50s of the foams and reference\nsurfactants, LAS was intermediate in toxicity and SDS was less toxic to rainbow\ntrout when compared with the foams. Comparisons of recommended application\nconcentrations to the test results indicate that accidental inputs of these\nchemicals into streams require substantial dilutions (100-1,750-fold) to reach\nconcentrations nonlethal to rainbow trout.",
