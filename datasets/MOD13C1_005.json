    "description": "The MOD13C1.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nGlobal MODIS vegetation indices are designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 470-nanometers, 648-nanometers, and 848-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for historical applications. The MODIS NDVI product contains atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances masked for water, clouds, and cloud shadows. Another MODIS index, the Enhanced Vegetation Index or EVI, uses the blue band to remove residual atmospheric contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The EVI also uses feedback adjustment to minimize canopy background variations and to enhance vegetation sensitivity from sparse to dense vegetation conditions.\r\n\r\nGlobal MOD13C1 data are cloud-free spatial composites of the gridded 16-day 1-kilometer MOD13A2, and are provided as a level-3 product projected on a 0.05 degree (5600-meter) geographic Climate Modeling Grid (CMG). Cloud-free global coverage is achieved by replacing clouds with the historical MODIS time series climatology record.\r\n\r\nVegetation indices are used for globally monitoring vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties, including land cover.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS Vegetation Indices products have attained Validation Stage 3.\r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nPhased production for improved temporal frequency (produced every 8 days using the last 16-days of acquisitions)\r\nReplaced NDVI_QA and EVI_QA with one VI_QA Science Data Set\r\nReduced file volume by using internal compression\r\nMore: MODIS Vegetation Index Product Series Collection 5 Change Summary (http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/QA_WWW/forPage/MOD13_VI_C5_Changes_Document_06_28_06.pdf)\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: February 18, 2000 - March 21, 2017\r\nArea: Global \r\nFile Size: ~35.5 MB \r\nProjection: Geographic (Lat/Lon)\r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nImage Dimensions: 3600 x 7200 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 0.05 degree (5600-meters) \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 13",
