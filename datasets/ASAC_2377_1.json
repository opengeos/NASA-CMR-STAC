In view of the increasing scientific and economic interest in Antarctic seas study of these organisms could provide a valuable tool in assessment and management of marine protected areas.\n\nTaken from the referenced publication:\n\nThe BANZARE Expeditions (British, Australian, New Zealand, Antarctic Research Expeditions) 1929-1931 sampled the marine benthos in the Southern Ocean, at the Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, and south-west of Tasmania and along the coast of the Australian Antarctic Territory.  Forty six stations at depths of 2 - 640 m were occupied along the Australian Antarctic Territory coast.  Eight species of Halecium including five new and Hydrodendron arboreum were found and recorded from eight stations.\n\nForty six stations were occupied along the Australian Antarctic Territory coast and samples collected using various trawls to depths of 640 m; some coastal collections were also made in shallow water 2 m deep.  The hydroid collection was originally deposited in the British Museum, Natural History (BMNH), London.  There, preserved material was sorted during the 1960s and microslide mounts prepared.  A small amount of material left over from the earlier AAE (Australian Antarctic Expedition) 1911-1914 was also incorporated into the BANZARE collection as Station No. 1785.  The entire BANZARE hydroid collection was sent to the National Museum of Victoria in Melbourne for identification.",
