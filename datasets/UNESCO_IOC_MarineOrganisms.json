    "description": "The UNESCO IOC Register of Marine Organisms is an easily searchable\n                  database which is a component of the ETI World Biodiversity\n                  Database. The Register of Marine Organisms is an already large and\n                  gradually growing dataset that is being built up, and maintained at\n                  the National Museum of Natural History, Leiden, the Netherlands. As\n                  soon as datasets for particular groups are more or less complete and\n                  reliable or at least useful, they are being transferred to the\n                  database at ETI in Amsterdam. The same holds for updates in the\n                  future.  The register is basically only a list of species names but it\n                  is tried to add at least some additional information, including author\n                  names, vernacular names, information on geographical and bathymetrical\n                  distribution and NODC numerical codes. Synonyms are added but only if\n                  they are still in use or were used in recent times.\n                  \n                  At the present time, many efforts are being undertaken to prepare\n                  partial biodiversity inventories at different levels - global,\n                  regional and national. The Register is, therefore, intended to act as\n                  a tool for the collection of information necessary to the development\n                  of strategies at the decision-making level for the conservation and\n                  sustainable use of biological diversity.\n                  \n                  Information was taken from the web site -\n                  The Register will draw on a checklist of marine organisms with a bibliography\n                  of key works. The initial phase of the project extends to the family level\n                  and it has largely been completed. The Register can, thus, provide a\n                  framework for more detailed work, such as compiling inventories of\n                  species. Furthermore, as a comprehensive list of marine organism\n                  families, the Register will act as an 'entering key' to more specific\n                  lists/databases (e.g. the ETI products). The second phase, already\n                  started, is aimed at expanding the Register down to the species\n                  level. The further development of the project must, however, be\n                  considered as an on-going exercise, leading to a product which also\n                  includes tools as guidance for identification. The Register is also\n                  aimed at building up a basis for an internationally agreed taxonomic\n                  terminology of marine organisms. In fact, while the project of a\n                  comprehensive register of marine organisms does not have the\n                  pretention of making taxonomists agree once and for all, the Register\n                  could hopefully act as a co-ordinating mechanism to help stabilize\n                  nomenclature. This goal is being achieved through the involvement of\n                  many specialists and, to this end, some 400 floppy disks with a draft\n                  register of families were distributed worldwide and numerous\n                  taxonomists were invited to contribute. Meanwhile many reviewed the\n                  first draft and provided their inputs to the completion of lists of\n                  species of several selected groups.  Another important goal of such a\n                  project is to come up with a reliable assessment of the number of\n                  marine species. Assessing the effective number of marine species is\n                  probably an impossible task. However, it is time to show what the\n                  international scientific community does know in this field. The\n                  Register, which will also be released on computer CD-ROM, is also\n                  aimed at promoting computer assisted taxonomy. This appears very\n                  important, especially in those countries where good libraries are\n                  scarce or absent. Furthermore, a computer database can always be\n                  easily updated.  The US National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC)\n                  Taxonomic Code - which is a hierarchical system of numerical codes\n                  used to represent the scientific name of organisms - has been\n                  introduced into the Register. This need for a coding system arises\n                  because biological data are nowadays increasingly processed by\n                  computer, and several taxonomic coding systems have been developed\n                  accordingly. The advantage is that, once a coding system has been\n                  introduced, the records can be easily manipulated. Similarly, FAO\n                  provided their standardized lists of common names in use for fisheries\n                  purposes for inclusion in the Register. The Register is also intended\n                  to help circulate biological data within the International\n                  Oceanographic Data Information and Exchange System (IODE), thus\n                  becoming accessible to IODE system users as well.",
