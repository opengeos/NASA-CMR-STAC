    "description": "The following abstract was taken from the the Chemical Analyses of Soils and\nOther Surficial Materials of the Conterminous United States Metadata, written\nby David B. Smith, Research Geologist, U.S. Geological Survey, Denver,\nColorado.  This metadata may be viewed in HTML at\n\"http://minerals.usgs.gov/\".\n\nABSTRACT\nThis data set contains geochemical data from soils and other regoliths\ncollected and analyzed by Hans Shacklette and colleagues beginning in 1958 and\ncontinuing until about 1976.  The samples were collected at a depth of about 20\ncm from sites that, insofar as possible, had surficial materials that were very\nlittle altered from their natural condition and that supported native plants. \nThe sample material at most sites could be termed \"soil\" because it was a\nmixture of disintegrated rock an organic matter.  Some of the sampled deposits,\nhowever, were not soils as defined above, but were other regolith types.  These\nincluded desert sands, sand dunes, some loess deposits, and beach and alluvial\ndeposits that contained little or no visible organic material.  The samples\nwere chemically analyzed by a variety of techniques in the U.S. Geological\nSurvey laboratories in Denver, CO.\n\nDATA\nThe data set contains 1,323 samples for a sampling density of approximately one\nsample per 6,000 square kilometers.  The data set is currently the only\nnational geochemical data set collected and analyzed according to standardized\nprotocols.  The data are most appropriately used to provide information on\nbackground concentrations of elements in soil. \n\nANALYSIS METHODS\nThe data was acquired using various chemical analysis methods.  In summary the\nmethods used were: 1)Emission spectrography for Al, Ba, Be, B, Ca, Ce, Cr, Co,\nCu, Ga, Fe, La, Pb, Mg, Mn, Mo, Nd, Ni, Nb, P, K, Sc, Na, Sr, Ti, V, Yb, Y, Zn,\nand Zr; 2)EDTA titration for Ca; 3)Colorimetric methods for P and Zn, 4)Flame\nphotometry for K; 5)Flame atomic absorption for Hg, Li, Mg, Na, Rb, and Zn;\n6)Flameless atomic absorption for Hg; 7)X-ray fluorescence spectrometry for Ca,\nGe, Fe, K, Se, Ag, S, and Ti; 8)Combustion for total carbon; and 9)Neutron\nactivation analysis for U and Th.\n\nTHE DATA\nThe data file is an ArcVie Shapefile and has been compressed using the WinZip\nprogram.  The usere will need to uncompress the file with WinZip or compatible\nsoftware before attempting to import the file into ArcView or ArcInfo. \nShapefiles can only be de-compressed with programs that recognize multi-file\narchives.\n\nThe shapefiles are designed for use with Arc/Info and ArcView, which are\nGIS/Mapping software marketed by ESRI.  By visiting\n\"http://www.esri.com/software/arcexplorer/index.html\" you may download ESRI's\nfree Arc Explorer software for viewing shape files on Windows 95, 98, or NT.",
