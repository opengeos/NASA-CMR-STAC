    "description": "This dataset provides a booklet documenting the discussions and outcomes from a knowledge-exchange meeting with Yup'ik elders from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), western Alaska, community members, and natural scientist to discuss landscape and weather changes that have been observed in their homelands. The meeting was held during November 14-16, 2018. Yup'ik participants represented several YKD villages that occupy very different biophysical environments, and they have lifelong perspectives of environmental conditions and change that predate the era of Earth-observing satellites by many decades. Nearly 16 hours of discussion and testimonials from YKD elders were recorded during the meeting. The booklet is structured according to the environmental change processes that were discussed (e.g., coastal flooding, permafrost thaw, shrub expansion, climate change) and includes narrative summaries, quotations from participants, graphical illustrations, and examples of the field- and remote-sensing-based scientific findings, and map products developed as part of the larger ABoVE project.",
