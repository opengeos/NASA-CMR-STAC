    "description": "Preliminary data set contains details of cores processed (eg. sample name/interval, dry weights, reactions, notes) and the methodology used. The future data set will document diatoms observed and counted for each sample. This project also has links to ASAC project 1044 (ASAC_1044), the Wilkes Land Glacial History (WEGA) project.\n\nWEGA cores from both the continental shelf (PC7,11,12)  and slope (PC19, 20, 21) region have been silica-selectively processed for their diatom content (see methodology file for details). The slides are mounted for quantitative assessment. Details of the cores that have been prepared are listed in the file WEGA_cores.csv in the downloadable dataset.\n\nAdditional silica-selective slides of the surface sediments on the continental shelf were processed for quantitative assessment. Details of the samples and their locations are listed in the file sediment_samples.csv in the downloadable dataset.\n\nThere have been no publications from the prepared slides as of the 15/04/02. An unpublished Honours Thesis uses limited diatom counts from slides prepared from PC 12. (Ms J. Erbs 2001). Title to be forthcoming.\n\nAny further enquiries referring to sample availability, curation, additional samples or publications arising from this material should be directed to Dr L. Armand.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\ndry weight (gm)\nSol A* reaction\nHCL reaction\nfinal dilution\nnotes\ncm depth\nbottom depth\nlatitude\nlongitude\ncore depth",
