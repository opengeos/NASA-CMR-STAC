    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 2720\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\nThe overall objective is to characterise Southern Ocean marine ecosystems, their influence on carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere and the deep ocean, and their sensitivity to past and future global change including climate warming, ocean stratification, and ocean ... acidification from anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In particular we plan to take advantage of naturally-occurring, persistent, zonal variations in Southern Ocean primary production and biomass in the Australian Sector to investigate the effects of iron addition from natural sources, and CO2 addition from anthropogenic sources, on Southern Ocean plankton communities of differing initial structure and composition.\n\nThese samples were collected on the SAZ-SENSE scientific voyage of the Australian Antarctic Program (Voyage 3 of the Aurora Australis, 2006-2007 season). \n\nSAZ-SENSE VOYAGE AU0703 ADCP DATA\n\n* The complete ADCP data for cruise au0703 are in the files:\nau070301.cny (ascii format)\na0703dop.mat (matlab format)\n\n* The \"on station\" ADCP data (specifically, the data for which the ship speed was less than or equal to 0.35 m/s) are in the files:\nau0703_slow35.cny (ascii format)\na0703dop_slow35.mat (matlab format)\n\n* The file bindep.dat shows the water depths (in metres) that correspond to the centre of each vertical bin.\n\n* The data are 30 minute averages. Each 30 minute averaging period starts from the time indicated. (so, e.g., an ensemble with time 120000 is the average from\n120000 to 123000).\n\n* ADCP currents are absolute - i.e. ship's motion has been subtracted out.\n\n* Note that the top few bins can have bad data from water dragged along by the ship. \n\n* Beware of data when the ship is underway - it's often suspect.\n\n* Important data quality information can be found in the data report referenced above.\n\n* The figure a0703difship30.eps shows the speed difference between vertical bin 2 and all other bins, where the data have been divided up into different speed classes for ship speed. The apparent vertical shear for bins ~1-10, and below bin ~40, is an error, possibly due to acoustic ringing from an air/water interface in the seachest. Data where ship speed is 0 to 1 m/s does not show this error.",
