    "description": "This document describes the deployment of five Ice Mass Balance Buoys (IMBs) and two automatic weather stations. These were primarily deployed on floes 2012103 and 20121029, as well as on helicopter flights (refer to buoy metadata for these).\n\nIMBs are labelled WHOI-1 to WHOI-6. WHOI-1 was not deployed and WHOI-3 and WHOI-5 failed and were recovered. TAS-2 was exchanged for WHOI-1\n\nDeployments (successful):\nTAS-2 deployed on helo flight 20 km from ship\nWHOI-4 deployed on helo flight 20 km from ship\nWHOI-6 Deployed next to AWS-1 on ice station 1013 on 11/04\nWHOI-2 Deployed next to AWS-2 on ice station 1029 on 11/01\n\nEach AWS record air temp, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, total incident short wave, snow depth, GPS position and snow particles near ground level and at about 1m height.\nAWS-1 deployed on 1013\nAWS-2 deployed on 1029\n\nIMBs record GPS position and temperature in air,snow,ice, and ocean. Sensors also have a heating mode that permit determination of media they are embedded in so that snow and ice thickness can be determined.\n\nREFER TO MAKSYM LOGBOOK SCANS FOR MORE DETAILS",
