    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 570\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\nFrom the abstracts of the referenced papers:\n\nThe Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica, has been the site for large winter bases built by the People's Republic of China and the USSR and a small summer base built by Australia.  The three bases are located within 3 km of one another.  Station development has occurred since 1986 and consequently environmental changes have been very sudden.  Associated with station development has been the establishment of a road network on one peninsula.  Visitors to the area have risen in number from 71 in 1987 to a conservative estimate of 445 in 1991.  The increased number of human visitors has resulted in rubbish and other evidence of visitation being observed over almost 10 square kilometres.  This paper attempts to outline environmental impacts observed by the authors since 1986.",
