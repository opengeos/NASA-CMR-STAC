    "description": "Presently, Antarctica's glaciers are melting as Earth's atmosphere and the Southern Ocean warm. Not much is known about how Antarctica's ice sheets might respond to ongoing and future warming, but such knowledge is important because Antarctica's ice sheets might raise global sea levels significantly with continued melting. Over time, mud accumulates on the sea floor around Antarctica that is composed of the skeletons and debris of microscopic marine organisms and sediment from the adjacent continent. As this mud is deposited, it creates a record of past environmental and ecological changes, including ocean depth, glacier advance and retreat, ocean temperature, ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, ocean chemistry, and continental weathering. Scientists interested in understanding how Antarctica's glaciers and ice sheets might respond to ongoing warming can use a variety of physical, biological, and chemical analyses of these mud archives to determine how long ago the mud was deposited and how the ice sheets, oceans, and marine ecosystems responded during intervals in the past when Earth's climate was warmer. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida, University of Massachusetts, and Northern Illinois University will reconstruct the depth, ocean temperature, weathering and nutrient input, and marine ecosystems in the central Ross Sea from ~17 to 13 million years ago, when the warm Miocene Climate Optimum transitioned to a cooler interval with more extensive ice sheets. Record will be generated from new sediments recovered during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374 and legacy sequences recovered in the 1970s during the Deep Sea Drilling Program. Results will be integrated into ice sheet and climate models to improve the accuracy of predictions.",
