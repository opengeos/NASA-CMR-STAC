    "description": "Excessive total dissolved gas pressure can cause gas-bubble trauma in fish\ndownstream from dams on the Columbia River. In cooperation with the U.S. Army\nCorps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey collected data on total\ndissolved gas pressure, barometric pressure, water temperature, and probe depth\nat eight stations on the lower Columbia River from the John Day forebay (river\nmile 215.6) to Camas (river mile 121.7) in water year 2000 (October 1, 1999, to\nSeptember 30, 2000). These data are in the databases of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Methods of data collection,\nreview, and processing, and quality-assurance data are presented in this\nreport.\n\nThe purpose of TDG monitoring is to provide USACE with (1) real-time data for\nmanaging streamflows and TDG levels upstream and downstream from its project\ndams in the lower Columbia River and (2) reviewed and corrected TDG data to\nevaluate conditions in relation to water-quality criteria and to develop a TDG\ndata base model for modeling the effect of various management scenarios of\nstream flow and spill on TDG levels.\n\nInstrumentation at each fixed station consisted of a TDG probe, an electronic\nbarometer, a data-collection platform (DCP), and a power supply.  The TDG probe\nwas manufactured by Hydrolab Corporation.  The probe had individual sensors for\nTDG, temperature, and probe depth (unvented sensor).  The TDG sensor consisted\nof a cylindrical framework wound with a length of Silastic (dimethyl silicon)\ntubing. The tubing was tied off at one end and the other end was connected to a\npressure transducer.  After the TDG pressure in the river equilibrated with the\ngas pressure inside the tubing (about 15 to 20 minutes), the pressure\ntransducer produced a measure of the TDG presure in the River.  The\nwater-temperature sensor was a thermocouple.  The barometer was contained in\nthe display unit of the Model TBO-L, a total dissolved gas meter manufactured\nby Common Sensing, Inc.  More information abou the TDG probe is provided by\nTanner, D. Q. And Johnston and M.W. 2001.\n\nThe fixed station monitors were calibrated every 2 weeks from March 10 to\nSeptember 15, 2000, and every three weeks for the remainder of the year, at\nwhich time Warrendale and Bonneville forebay were the only sites in operation. \nThe general procedure was to check the operation of the TDG probe in the field\nwithout disturbing it, replace the field probe with one that had just been\ncalibrated in the laboratory, and then check the operation of the newly\ndeployed field probe.  The details of the laboratory calibration procedure are\noutlined in Tanner and Johnston, 2001.\n\nInformation for this metadata was obtained from the Technical Reports of the\nOregon District available at http://oregon.usgs.gov/pubs_dir/online_list.html .",
