    "description": "Mineralogy data collected from the CEAMARC-CASO voyage of the Aurora Australis during the 2007-2008 summer season.  The data consist of a large number of images, plus documents detailing analysis methods and file descriptions.\n\nTaken from the \"Methods\" document in the download file:\n\nCEAMARC MINERALOGY METHODS\nMargaret Lindsay \nAugust 2009 \n\nMineralogy sampling method:\n(numbers in brackets refer to image below)\nIndividual bags containing the samples taken during the CEAMARC 2007/08 voyage (1) were emptied in to a sorting tray and slightly defrosted to enable the biota to be separated and sorted in to like biota (2). Taxonomic samples were selected to represent different species. The taxonomy sample was moved onto the bench and allocated a STD barcode, a photo was taken (3) and the image number, barcode and 'identification' of the biota was recorded. From the taxonomy sample a small (larger than 0.05g) sample of the individual was dissected, weighed (4) and bagged separately, this sub-sample became the 'mineralogy sample' that were sent to Damien Gore at Macquarie University on 21/05/2009 for mineralogy analysis by Damien Gore and Peter Johnston.\n \n\nSamples were tracked using the Sample Tracking Database (located \\\\aad.gov.au\\files\\HIRP\\new-shared-hirp\\30 Samples tracking + LIMS (Lab Inf Management Sys)\\Sample Tracking Database\\HIRP STD Working).  The key barcodes are:\nThe nally bin's containing the CEAMARC samples are located in reefer 1 (-20 C) (barcode 11919). The original CEAMARC samples (parent container) are in nally bins 14762 and 14759. The taxonomy samples are in a nally barcoded as 70469 (contains 10 bags). The mineralogy samples are in a nally bin barcoded 70472 (contains three bags) and are currently at Macquarie University for mineralogy analysis.\n\n\nData was entered during the lab process into the spreadsheet file - Sub sampling taxonomy and mineralogy.xls the details of the spreadsheets contents;\n\nThe list below describes each column in the 'Taxonomy and Mineralogy', 'bamboo coral' and 'other analyses' sheets from the excel file - Sub sampling taxonomy and mineralogy.xls (location described in G:\\CEAMARC\\CEAMARC MINERALOGY FILE DESCRIPTIONS.doc)\n\nDate sampled\nDate that the taxonomic samples were dissected to obtain the mineralogy samples\n\nParent barcode\nSTD barcode for the nally bin that the samples are located in\n\nSite barcode\nSTD barcode for the CEAMARC site and deployment \n\nCEAMARC site number\nCEAMARC voyage sample site number\n\nCEAMARC event number\nThe CEAMARC voyage event number is the sampling devices deployment number, related to CEAMARC site number \n\nTaxonomy bag barcode\nSTD barcode for the bag that contains the taxonomy samples\n\nImage number\nThe image number of the taxonomy sample in it's entirety before dissected to obtain the mineralogy sample.
