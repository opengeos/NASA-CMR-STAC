    "description": "A collaborative project between the U.S. Geological Survey's Coastal and Marine\n      Geology Program and the National Park Service (NPS) has been developed to\n      create an inventory of geologic resources for National Park Service lands on\n      the Big Island of Hawai?i. The NPS Geologic Resources Inventories are\n      recognized as essential for the effective management, interpretation, and\n      understanding of vital park resources. In general, there are three principal\n      components of the inventories: geologic bibliographies, digital geologic maps,\n      and geologic reports. The geologic reports are specific to each individual park\n      and include information on the geologic features and processes that are\n      important to the management of park resources, including ecological, cultural\n      and recreational resources. This report summarizes a component of the geologic\n      inventory concerned specifically with characterizing the coastal geomorphology\n      of the beach system within Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park (NHP) and\n      describes an analysis that utilizes georeferenced and orthorectified aerial\n      photography to understand the spatial and temporal trends in shoreline change\n      from 1950 to 2002. In addition, spatial patterns of beach change were examined\n      and a beach stability map was developed. Both the shoreline change rates and\n      the beach stability map are designed to help Park personnel effectively manage\n      the valuable park resources within the context of understanding natural changes\n      to the KAHO beach system.\n      \n      [Summary provided by the USGS.]",
