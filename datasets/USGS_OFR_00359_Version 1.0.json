    "description": "The data set for the Apache Canyon quadrangle has been prepared by the\nSouthern California Areal Mapping Project (SCAMP), a cooperative project\nsponsored jointly by the U.S.  Geological Survey and the California Division of\nMines and Geology, as part of an ongoing effort to utilize a Geographical\nInformation System (GIS) format to create a regional digital geologic database\nfor southern California.  This regional database is being developed as a\ncontribution to the National Geologic Map Data Base of the National Cooperative\nGeologic Mapping Program of the USGS.\n\nThe digital geologic map database for the Apache Canyon quadrangle has been\ncreated as a general-purpose data set that is applicable to other land-related\ninvestigations in the earth and biological sciences.  The Apache Canyon\ndatabase is not suitable for site-specific geologic evaluations at scales\ngreater than 1:24,000 (1 in = 2,000 ft).\n\nThis data set maps and describes the geology of the Apache Canyon 7.5'\nquadrangle, Ventura and Kern Counties, California. Created using Environmental\nSystems Research Institute's ARC/INFO software, the data base consists of the\nfollowing items: (1) a map coverage showing geologic contacts, faults and\nunits, (2) a separate coverage layer showing structural data, (3) an additional\npoint coverage which contains bedding data, (4) a point coverage containing\nsample localities, (5) a scanned topographic base at a scale of 1:24,000, and\n(6) attribute tables for geologic units (polygons), contacts (arcs), and\nsite-specific data (points). The data base is accompanied by a readme file and\nthis metadata file.  In addition, the data set includes the following graphic\nand text products: (1) A jpg file (.jpg) containing a browse-graphic of the\ngeologic map on a 1:24,000 topographic base.  The map is accompanied by a\nmarginal explanation consisting of a List of Map Units, a Correlation of Map\nUnits, and a key to point and line symbols.  (2) A .pdf file of a geologic\nexplanation pamphlet that includes a Description of Map Units.  (3) Two\npostScript graphic plot-files: one containing the geologic map on a 1:24,000\ntopographic base and the other, three accompanying structural cross sections.\n\nThe geologic map database contains original U.S. Geological Survey data\ngenerated by detailed field observation and by interpretation of aerial\nphotographs.  The map was created by transferring lines and point data from the\naerial photographs to a 1:24,000 topographic base by using a PG-2 plotter. The\nmap was scribed, scanned, and imported into ARC/INFO, where the database was\nbuilt. Within the database, geologic contacts are represented as lines (arcs),\ngeologic units as polygons, and site-specific data as points. Polygon, arc, and\npoint attribute tables (.pat, .aat, and .pat, respectively) uniquely identify\neach geologic datum and link it to other tables (.rel) that provide more\ndetailed geologic information.",
