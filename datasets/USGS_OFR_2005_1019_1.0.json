    "description": "The Los Angeles 30' x 60' quadrangle covers approximately 5,000 km2 including\nmuch of the densely populated urban and suburban areas of the southern\nCalifornia megalopolis. The quadrangle is about 90 km east-west and about 55 km\nnorth-south, extending from Fillmore and Thousand Oaks in the west to Vincent\nin the northeast and Montebello in the southeast. It covers the urban San\nGabriel Valley and San Gabriel Mountain foothill communities from Monrovia to\nPasadena, as well as Glendale, downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Santa Monica,\nMalibu, and all the communities in the San Fernando Valley, Simi Valley, and\nthe upper Santa Clara River Valley. Population of these urban and suburban\nareas, as listed in the 2000 Census, totals approximately 5.6 million, and\nproperty value is estimated to total hundreds of billions of dollars. The\nquadrangle also includes large areas of wilderness in the Angeles and Los\nPadres National Forests, in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation\nArea, and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary. The relief in the quadrangle ranges from\nabout a hundred meters sub sea (in Santa Monica Bay) to more than 2,000 meters\nabove sea level at Pacifico Mountain in the high San Gabriel Mountains.\nResidents and transient visitors are subject to potential hazards from\nearthquakes, debris flows and other landslides, floods, wildfires, subsidence\nfrom ground water and petroleum withdrawal.\n\nThis geologic map is intended to illustrate the distribution of the rocks and\nsurficial deposits of the area and their structural and stratigraphic relations\nto one another. It provides a regional geologic framework as an aid to better\nevaluations of the potential for hazard from active earth processes; however,\nit is not sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for site-specific\nevaluations. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
