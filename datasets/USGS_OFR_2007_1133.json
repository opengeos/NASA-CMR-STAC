    "description": "Coastal cliff retreat, the landward migration of the cliff face,\nis a chronic problem along many rocky coastlines in the United\nStates. As coastal populations continue to grow and community\ninfrastructures are threatened by erosion, there is increased demand\nfor accurate information regarding trends and rates of coastal cliff\nretreat. There is also a need for a comprehensive analysis of cliff\nretreat that is consistent from one coastal region to another. To meet\nthese national needs, the U.S. Geological Survey is conducting an\nanalysis of historical coastal cliff retreat along open-ocean rocky\ncoastlines of the conterminous United States and parts of Hawaii,\nAlaska, and the Great Lakes. One purpose of this work is to develop\nstandard repeatable methods for mapping and analyzing coastal cliff\nretreat so that periodic updates of coastal erosion can be made\nnationally that are systematic and internally consistent. This report\non the California Coast is an accompaniment to a report on long-term\nsandy shoreline change for California. This report summarizes the\nmethods of analysis, interprets the results, and provides explanations\nregarding long-term rates of cliff retreat. Neither detailed\nbackground information on the National Assessment of Shoreline Change\nProject nor detailed descriptions of the geology and geomorphology of\nthe California coastline are presented in this report. The reader is\nreferred to the shoreline change report (Hapke et al., 2006) for this\ntype of background information. Cliff retreat evaluations are based on\ncomparing one historical cliff edge digitized from maps, with a recent\ncliff edge interpreted from lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)\ntopographic surveys. The historical cliff edges are from a period\nranging from 1920-1930, whereas the lidar cliff edges are from either\n1998 or 2002. Long-term (~70-year) rates of retreat are calculated\nusing the two cliff edges. The rates of retreat presented in this\nreport represent conditions from the 1930s to 1998, and are not\nintended for predicting future cliff edge positions or rates of\nretreat. Due to the geomorphology of much of California's rocky coast\n(high-relief, steep slopes with no defined cliff edge) as well as to\ngaps in both the historical maps and lidar data, we were able to\nderive two cliff edges and therefore calculate cliff retreat rates for\na total of 353 km. The average rate of coastal cliff retreat for the\nState of California was -0.3\u00b10.2 m/yr, based on rates averaged from\n17,653 individual transects measured throughout all areas of\nCalifornia's rocky coastline. The average amount of cliff retreat was\n17.7 m over the 70-year time period of our analysis. Retreat rates\nwere generally lowest in Southern California where coastal engineering\nprojects have greatly altered the natural coastal system. California\npermits shoreline stabilization structures where homes, buildings or\nother community infrastructure are imminently threatened by\nerosion. While seawalls and/or riprap revetments have been constructed\nin all three sections of California, a larger proportion of the\nSouthern California coast has been protected by engineering works,\ndue, in part, to the larger population pressures in this area.\n      [Summary provided by the USGS.]",
