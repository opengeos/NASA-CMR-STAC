    "description": "Data on the morphological and reproductive responses of 4 species of wild caught Abatus heart urchins (A. nimrodi, A. shackletoni, A. ingens, and A. philippii) to sewage effluent from the Davis station sewage outfall. Between 19 and 21 individuals of each species were collected from three sites close to the station. The Sewage outfall site, which acted as the impacted site for the study, and two reference sites, one at Airport Beach, and a second and Heidemann Bay.\n\nMorphological measurements taken from each individual were length, width, height, anterior length, and posterior length. A qualitative assessment of the calcareous test of each individual was conducted to determine the presence of any abnormalities (as per Land 2005, PhD thesis) in the individuals morphology. \n\nReproductive data collected were a gonadosotic index (calculated by dividing the gonal mass of a individual by the total mass of that individual). And for females morphological measurements (length and width) of each brood pouch were taken, and the type and number of juveniles in each pouch was counted.\n\nData available: In the spreadsheet provided a description of measurements is given in the first tab. \n\nAll morphological and reproductive data is presented in the second tab. In full these are;\nParent Barcode (for tracking purposes) \nIndividual Barcode (for tracking purposes),\ndate collected (date the animal was collected)\ndate processed (date data were collected)\nsite (site the animal came from)\nspecies (nimrodi, shackletoni, ingens, or philippii)\nsex (male or female)\nsamples taken for other projects (morphology, genetics, histology)\nMorphological measurements (length, width, height, posterior length, anterior length, all recorded in millimetres)\nAny of a possible 6 abnormalities observed.\nBrood pouch morphometrics (length and width in millimeters of each of the 4 brood pouches for a female) \nReproductive fitness, being the number of young at any of 3 stages in each of the 4 brood pouches and the total number of juveniles produced by the adult female. \nTotal Wet Mass (mass of the entire animal recorded in grams)\nGonad Wet Mass (mass of the gonad of an individual)\nGonadosmotic Index (measure of reproductive fitness, and is the Gonad Wet Mass divided by the Total Wet Mass of each individual)\n\nA blank datasheet used to record the data is contained within the third tab. \n\nThe two final tabs are appendices used to aid the qualitative assessments. The first (Appendix 1) gives photo descriptions of each of the known abnormalities in Abatus sp (Adapted from Lane (2005) PhD thesis). The second (Appendix 2) gives photo descriptions of each of the developmental stages of juveniles in Abatus sp.",
