    "description": "These data are mainly based on a paper by Phil Pugh (Pugh 2004, Biogeography of spiders on the islands of the Southern Ocean, Journal of Natural History, 38:1461-1487), but has been updated for Subantarctic and Antarctic regions. The names of people who have contributed to this update are listed in the dataset.\n\nThe data are presented in a series of worksheets in an excel file.\n\nThe introduction worksheet provides some basic information about the dataset.\n\nThe references worksheet is a list of references from Pugh's paper that he cited as well as more recent references. It also has some notes on the dataset.\n\nThe initial table worksheet is table 1 from Pugh (2004)\n\nThe antarctic-subantarctic worksheet are data retrieved from Pugh's (2004) table 1 specifically for subantarctic and Antarctic regions. These data have been checked and updated for the region.\n\nThe transposed antarc-subantarctic- worksheet are selected data from Table 1 transposed.\n\nFrom the abstract of the Pugh paper:\n\nThe araneofauna of the extreme Southern Hemisphere is highly impoverished and disharmonic.  Four dead anthropogenic immigrant spiders have been collected from Antarctica while only 115 verified species from 26 families are reported on islands of the Southern Ocean.  Cluster analysis of the verified Southern Ocean species distribution data identifies a weak, but distinct, Neotropical/South Atlantic association together with robust South Indian and South Pacific biogeographic clusters.  These groupings, largely attributed to vicariance and/or endemism, contain little evidence of post-Pleistocene dispersal.  Indeed the 14 records of anthropogenic origin suggest that the pace of recent human-mediated introduction has been at least 30 times more rapid than that of Holocene natural dispersal.",
