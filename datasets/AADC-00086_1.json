    "description": "This dataset is a record of a nutrition project held on Davis station during the year 1989. The abstract of the report is as follows.\n\nMany countries have drawn up dietary guidelines for their populations in an attempt to decrease the premature mortality and morbidity associated with coronary heart disease (CHD).  One of the consistent recommendations has been the partial substitution of saturated fatty acids (SFA) by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).  More recently, as a shadow has been cast over the long-term safety of high PUFA intakes, epidemiological and intervention studies have suggested that monosaturated fatty acids (MUFA), especially oleic acid, enrichment of the diet might not only improve plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles as effectively as the PUFA, but may have other advantages including anti-thrombotic activity and anti-oxidation properties.\n\nThe principle aims of this nutrition project were to examine the effectiveness of dietary goals in practice and to compare MUFA and PUFA in terms of improvement of lipid and lipoprotein profiles and dietary acceptance.  This project was undertaken at Davis station, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica. Thirty expeditioners, all members of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition's (ANARE) 1989 wintering expedition, acted as subjects in the study.  The subjects were all fit and healthy men and women on no medication.\n\nThe fields in this dataset include:\nCholesterol\nEnergy\nFat Protein\nCarbohydrate\nAlcohol\nSFA\nMUFA\nPUFA\nChange in TC level\nChange in LDL-C level\nDate\nDietary Period\nNutrient\nPost Dietary Period Analysis\nControl Stations\nMean station Levels + SEM (mmol/L)\nHDL-C+SEM\nLDL-C+SEM\nLDL-C / HDLC\nMean Triglyceride Levels\nMean Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase\nFatty Acid Class (Mean % of total)\nWeek\nWeight\nSkinfold\nWaist/hip Ratio\nBlood Pressure",
