    "description": "This report presents probabilistic seismic hazard maps for\nSeattle, Washington, based on over 500 3D simulations of ground\nmotions from scenario earthquakes. These maps include 3D sedimentary\nbasin effects and rupture directivity. Nonlinear site response for\nsoft-soil sites of fill and alluvium was also applied in the maps. The\nreport describes the methodology for incorporating source and site\ndependent amplification factors into a probabilistic seismic hazard\ncalculation. 3D simulations were conducted for the various earthquake\nsources that can affect Seattle: Seattle fault zone, Cascadia\nsubduction zone, South Whidbey Island fault, and background shallow\nand deep earthquakes. The maps presented in this document used\nessentially the same set of faults and distributed-earthquake sources\nas in the 2002 national seismic hazard maps. The 3D velocity model\nutilized in the simulations was validated by modeling the amplitudes\nand waveforms of observed seismograms from five earthquakes in the\nregion, including the 2001 M6.8 Nisqually earthquake. The\nprobabilistic seismic hazard maps presented here depict 1 Hz response\nspectral accelerations with 10%, 5%, and 2% probabilities of\nexceedance in 50 years. The maps are based on determinations of\nseismic hazard for 7236 sites with a spacing of 280 m.\n      \n      The maps show that the most hazardous locations for this\nfrequency band (around 1 Hz) are soft-soil sites (fill and alluvium)\nwithin the Seattle basin and along the inferred trace of the frontal\nfault of the Seattle fault zone. The next highest hazard is typically\nfound for soft-soil sites in the Duwamish Valley south of the Seattle\nbasin. In general, stiff-soil sites in the Seattle basin exhibit\nhigher hazard than stiff-soil sites outside the basin. Sites with\nshallow bedrock outside the Seattle basin have the lowest estimated\nhazard for this frequency band.\n      [Summary provided by the USGS.]",
