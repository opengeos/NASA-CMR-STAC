    "description": "ERBE_S10N_WFOV_SF_Edition2 is the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) S-10N (Non-scanner-only) Wide Field of View (WFOV) Shape Factor (SF) Radiant Flux and Albedo Edition 2 in Native Format data product. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThis product resulted from the reprocessed ERBE S10N_WFOV ERBS Edition2 data product. It contains temporally and spatially averaged shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes derived from one month of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment non-scanning wide field-of-view instruments aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS). Instantaneous Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) fluxes from the ERBE/ERBS S7 product were spatially averaged on a 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 equal-angle grid using numerical filter and shape factor techniques, respectively. ERBE scanner-independent temporal interpolation algorithms were applied to produce daily, monthly-hourly, and monthly mean fluxes from the instantaneous gridded data. The S10N_WFOV files contain both temporally averaged and instantaneous gridded mean values of TOA total-sky LW flux, total-sky SW flux, and total-sky albedo for each 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 region observed during the month. The major differences between Edition2 and the original release were in the monthly mean fluxes with (1) the incorporation of stochastic quality assurance algorithms for filtering out monthly-mean data with excessive temporal sample errors and (2) a self-consistent usage of the WFOV data in selecting scene-dependent directional models for temporal interpolation of the ERBE WFOV instantaneous gridded data.",
