    "description": "The paleohydraulic Triassic alluvial plain sequence at the head of the Dry Valleys was studied. The Triassic Beacon Supergroup is divided into five stratigraphic units (The Fleming Member of the Feather Conglomerate and the Members A-D of the Lashly Formation) and all are exposed at Mt Bastion where this study was concerned.  A detailed investigation of each unit was conducted to determine the paleohydraulic regimes operating during the Triassic deposition. The character of the river system (sinuosity, channel width, depth, slope, discharge, etc) was determined from features of the sedimentary sequence.",
