    "description": "Lead-rich sediments, containing at least 1000 ppm of lead (Pb), and derived\nmainly from discarded mill tailings in the Coeur d'Alene mining region, cover\nabout 60 km2 of the 80-km2 floor of the main stem of the Coeur d'Alene River\nvalley, in north Idaho. Although mill tailings have not been discarded directly\ninto tributary streams since 1968, frequent floods continue to re-mobilize\nsediment from large secondary sources, previously deposited on the bed, banks,\nalluvial terraces, and natural levees of the river. Thus, lead-rich sediments\n(also enriched in iron, manganese, zinc, copper, arsenic, cadmium, antimony and\nmercury) continue to be deposited on the floodplain. This is hazardous to the\nhealth of resident and visiting human and wildlife populations, attracted by\nthe river and its lateral lakes and wetlands.\n\nThis report documents and compares depositional rates and lead concentrations\nof lead-rich sediments deposited on the bed, banks, natural levees, and flood\nbasins of the main stem of the Coeur d'Alene River during several\ntime-stratigraphic intervals. These intervals are defined by their\nstratigraphic positions relative to the base of the section of lead-rich\nsediments, the 1980 Mt. St. Helens volcanic-ash layer, and the sedimentary\nsurface at the time of sampling. Four important intervals represent sediment\ndeposition during the following time spans (younger to older): 1. Baseline,\nfrom 1980 to about 1993 (after tailings disposal to streams ended, but before\nany major removals of lead-rich sediments); 2. Early post-tailings-release,\nfrom about 1968 to 1980; 3. Historic floodplain-contamination, from about 1903\nto 1968; and 4. Background, before the 1893 flood (the first major flood after\nlarge-scale mining and milling began upstream in 1886).\n\nMedians of baseline depositional rates and lead concentrations in levee\nsediments vary laterally, from 6.4 cm/10y and 3300 ppm Pb on riverbanks and\nlevee fore-slopes to 2.8 cm/10y and 3800 ppm Pb on levee back-slope uplands. In\nlateral flood basins, baseline medians increase with water depth, from 2.2\ncm/10y and 1900 ppm Pb in lateral marshes, to 2.9 cm/10y and 2100 ppm Pb in\nlittoral margins of lateral lakes, and 4.0 cm/10y and 4400 ppm Pb on limnetic\nbottoms of lateral lakes. \n\nThe median of lead concentrations in baseline sediments is 82 percent of the\nmedian for early post-tailings-release sediments, with a 69-percent probability\nthat the two data sets represent statistically different populations. By\ncontrast, the median of lead concentrations in baseline sediments is 57 percent\nof the corresponding median for historic-interval sediments, and these two data\nsets definitely represent statistically different populations. The\narea-weighted average of medians of lead concentrations in baseline sediments\nof all depositional settings is 2900 ppm Pb, which is 1.6 times the 1800 ppm Pb\nthat can be lethal to waterfowl. It also is 2.9 times the 1000-ppm-Pb threshold\nfor removal of contaminated soil from residential yards in the Coeur d'Alene\nmining region, and 111 times the 26-ppm median of background lead\nconcentrations in pre-industrial floodplain sediments.\n\nDuring episodes of high discharge, lead-rich sediments will continue to be\nmobilized from large secondary sources on the bed, banks, and natural levees of\nthe river, and will continue to be deposited on the floodplain during frequent\nfloods. Floodplain deposition of lead-rich sediments will continue for\ncenturies unless major secondary sources are removed or stabilized. It is\ntherefore important to design, sequence, implement, and maintain remediation in\nways that will limit recontamination. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
