    "description": "The data sets on this compact disc are a compilation of several geographic\n      reference data sets of interest to the global-change research community.  The\n      data sets were chosen with input from the Global Energy and Water Cycle\n      Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP) Data\n      Committee and the GCIP Hydrometeorology and Atmospheric Subpanels.  The data\n      sets include: locations and periods of record for stream gages, reservoir\n      gages, and meteorological stations; a 500-meter-resolution digital elevation\n      model; grid-node locations for the Eta numerical weather-prediction model; and\n      digital map data sets of geology, land use, streams, large reservoirs, average\n      annual runoff, average annual precipitation, average annual temperature,\n      average annual heating and cooling degree days, hydrologic units, and state and\n      county boundaries.  Also included are digital index maps for LANDSAT scenes,\n      and for the U.S. Geological Survey 1:250,000, 1:100,000, and 1:24,000-scale map\n      series.  Most of the data sets cover the conterminous United States; the\n      digital elevation model also includes part of southern Canada. The stream and\n      reservoir gage and meteorological station files cover all states having area\n      within the Mississippi River Basin plus that part of the Mississippi River\n      Basin lying within Canada.  Several data-base retrievals were processed by\n      state, therefore many sites outside the Mississippi River Basin are included. \n      \n      See: \"http://nsdi.usgs.gov\" for a complete desciption of metadata and browse\n      images.",
