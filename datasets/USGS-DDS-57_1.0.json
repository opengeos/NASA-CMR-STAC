    "description": "This report summarizes the stratigraphic framework of Lower and Upper\nCretaceous sedimentary rocks in the central and eastern part of Montana, and\nwas written in support of U.S. Geological Survey studies of energy resources in\nCretaceous rocks.  The study was undertaken as a part of a larger project,\nunder the direction of J.L. Ridgley, that investigated the occurrence of\nshallow biogenic gas in Upper Cretaceous rocks in north-central Montana and\nadjacent areas of Canada.  The approach used here is to describe briefly the\nrock units and to show their thickness, distribution, and structural\nconfiguration using isopach maps, cross sections, and structure contour maps.\n\nIn the study area, within a central foreland basin setting, most deposition of\nLower and Upper Cretaceous rocks was between the lithologic end members of very\ncoarse terrigenous clastics and the open marine chalks.  With few exceptions,\nCretaceous rocks in the study area consist of fine- to medium-grained\nsandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and shale.  Other rock types, such as\nconglomerate and limestone are relatively rare in the section.  Bentonite beds,\na result of ash falls from volcanic eruptions to the west, are volumetrically\ninsignificant, but are important marker beds through much of the Cretaceous\nsection.\n\nEighteen formations are described in this report; five formations of Early\nCretaceous age and thirteen of Late Cretaceous age. The thickness of the entire\nCretaceous section ranges between about 3,500 ft and 5,600 ft; within this\nrange between 500 and 1,000 ft are Lower Cretaceous and the remainder are Upper\nCretaceous. The entire section is thickest on the west, and thins eastward.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
