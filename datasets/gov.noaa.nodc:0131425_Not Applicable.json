    "description": "The Bowhead Whale Feeding Ecology Study (BOWFEST) was initiated in May 2007 through an Interagency Agreement between the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) (formerly Minerals Management Service (MMS)) and the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML). This was a multi-disciplinary study involving oceanography, acoustics, tagging, stomach sampling and aerial surveys and included scientists from a wide range of institutions (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), University of Rhode Island (URI), University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), University of Washington (UW), Oregon State University (OSU), North Slope Borough (NSB), and NMML. The data described and presented here are only from the aerial survey component of this larger study. The focus of the aerial survey was to document patterns and variability in the timing and locations of bowhead whales. Using a NOAA Twin Otter, scientists from NMML conducted aerial surveys from mid-August to mid-September during this five year study between years 2007-2011. Surveys were conducted in the BOWFEST study area (continental shelf waters between 157 degree W and 152 degree W and from the coastline to 72 degree N, with most of the effort concentrated between 157 degree W and 154 degree W and between the coastline and 71 degree 44'N).",
