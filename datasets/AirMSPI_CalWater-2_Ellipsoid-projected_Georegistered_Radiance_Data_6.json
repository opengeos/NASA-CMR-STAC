    "description": "AirMSPI_CalWater-2_Ellipsoid-projected_Georegistered_Radiance_Data are AirMSPI Ellipsoid-projected georegistered radiance product acquired during the Precipitation, Aerosols, and Pacific Atmospheric Rivers Experiment (CalWater-2) flight campaign Jan-Feb 2015. \r\n\r\nAirMSPI Level 1B2 products contain radiometric and polarimetric images of clouds, aerosols, and the surface of the Earth. In particular, products contain map-projected data at 8 wavelengths: 355, 380, 445, 470, 555, 660, 865, and 935 nm. The data products include radiance, time, solar zenith, solar azimuth, view zenith, and view azimuth for all spectral bands. Wavelengths for which polarization information is available (470, 660, and 865 nm) also include the Stokes parameters Q and U, as well as degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and angle of linear polarization (AOLP). Q, U, and AOLP are reported relative to both the scattering- and view meridian planes. Files are distributed in HDF-EOS-5 format.\r\n\r\nThis release of AirMSPI data contains all targets acquired during the Precipitation, Aerosols, and Pacific Atmospheric Rivers Experiment (CalWater-2) flight campaign, which was conducted in partnership between NASA, NOAA, DOE, NSF, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Colorado State University. The campaign focused on the study of atmospheric rivers and interaction with aerosols offshore of California in the North Pacific. NASA\u2019s ER-2 high-altitude research aircraft, with AirMSPI, was based out of Palmdale, CA. AirMSPI data were acquired from January 20 through February 24, 2015.",
