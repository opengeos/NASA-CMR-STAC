    "description": "The MOD15A2.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe level-4 MODIS global Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) product is composited every 8 days at 1-kilometer resolution on a Sinusoidal grid. Science Data Sets provided in the MOD15A2 include LAI, FPAR, a quality rating, and standard deviation for each variable.\r\n\r\nThe LAI variable defines the number of equivalent layers of leaves relative to a unit of ground area, whereas FPAR measures the proportion of available radiation in the photosynthetically active wavelengths that are absorbed by a canopy. Both variables are used as satellite-derived parameters for calculating surface photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and net primary production, which in turn are used to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS/Terra LAI products are Validated Stage 2, accuracy has been assessed over a widely distributed set of locations and time periods via several ground-truth and validation efforts. Version-5 MODIS/Terra FPAR products are Validated Stage 1, meaning that accuracy has been estimated using a small number of independent measurements obtained from selected locations and time periods and ground-truth/field program efforts. \r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~10 x 10 km \r\nSize: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~0.2 MB compressed \r\nResolution: 1000 meters \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nBands: 6\r\nTemporal Range: 2000-02-18 to 2017-03-30",
