    "description": "Cattlemans detention basin, South Lake Tahoe, California is designed to capture\nand reduce urban runoff and pollutants originating from developed areas before\nentering Cold Creek, which is tributary to Trout Creek and to Lake Tahoe. The\neffectiveness of the basin in reducing sediment and nutrient loads currently is\nbeing assessed with a five-year study. Hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium\nnear the detention basin is needed to estimate ground-water flow and subsurface\nnutrient transport. Hydraulic conductivity was estimated using slug tests in 27\nmonitoring wells that surround the detention basin. For each test, water was\npoured rapidly into a well, changes in water-level were monitored, and the\nobserved changes were analyzed using the Bouwer and Rice method. Each well was\ntested one to four times. A total of 24 wells were tested more than once. Of\nthe 24 wells, the differences among the tests were within 10 percent of the\naverage. Estimated hydraulic conductivities of basin alluvium range from 0.5 to\n70 feet per day with an average of 17.8 feet per day. This range is consistent\nwith the sandy alluvial deposits observed in the area of Cattlemans detention\nbasin.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
