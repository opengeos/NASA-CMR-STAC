    "description": "LASE_SOLVE is the Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE) Data Obtained During the SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE) data product. Data collection for this data set is complete.\r\n\r\nThe LASE SOLVE field experiment was conducted in the Arctic during November 1999 to March 2000 with the scientists based above the Arctic Circle at the airport in Kiruna, Sweden. Measurements of stratospheric composition over the Arctic were made using a large suite of instruments aboard several European aircraft, as well as on NASA's DC-8 and ER-2 aircraft. Additionally, balloons and ground-based instruments also took atmospheric readings and scientists gathered ozone-related data to use in validating measurements by the SAGE III instrument aboard the Russian Meteor-3 satellite. \r\n\r\nLASE airborne lidar produced measurements of aerosols and water vapor vertical profiles from the aircraft altitude (6-8 km) down to the surface. SOLVE was a measurement campaign designed to examine the processes which control polar to mid-latitude stratospheric ozone levels. The goal of SOLVE was for its results to expand the understanding polar ozone processes to provide greater confidence in ozone monitoring capabilities.",
