    "description": "The heavy metal content of whole Paramoera walkeri (Eusiridae, Amphipoda) were measured from specimens collected and deployed in experimental mesocosms around Casey station during the summer of 2003/04. Data are the parts per million (ppm) concentrations of 45 heavy metals measured via acid digestion and ICP-MS analysis. P.walkeri were collected from an intertidal area on the northern side of O'Brien Bay and deployed in mesocosms (perforated sample jars housed within perforated 20 litre food buckets) suspended approximately three metres below the sea ice at four sites; two potentially impacted sites in Brown Bay and two control sites, O'Brien Bay and McGrady Cove. The experiment was run on three occasions during the summer each lasting two weeks.\n\nThese data were collected as part of ASAC project 2201 (ASAC_2201 - Natural variability and human induced change in Antarctic nearshore marine benthic communities).\n\nSee also other metadata records by Glenn Johnstone for related information.",
