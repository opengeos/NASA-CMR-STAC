    "description": "The Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis System (GIRAS) was\ndeveloped in the mid 70s to put into digital form a number of data layers which\nwere of interest to the USGS. One of these data layers was the Hydrologic\nUnits. The map is based on the Hydrologic Unit Maps published by the U.S.\nGeological Survey Office of Water Data Coordination, together with the list\ndescriptions and name of region, subregion, accounting units, and cataloging\nunit. The hydrologic units are encoded with an eight- digit number that\nindicates the hydrologic region (first two digits), hydrologic subregion\n(second two digits), accounting unit (third two digits), and cataloging unit\n(fourth two digits).\n\nThe data produced by GIRAS was originally collected at a scale of 1: 250K. Some\nareas, notably major cities in the west, were recompiled at a scale of 1: 100K.\nIn order to join the data together and use the data in a geographic information\nsystem (GIS) the data were processed in the ARC/INFO GUS software package.\nWithin the GIS, the data were edge matched and the neatline boundaries between\nmaps were removed to create a single data set for the conterminous United\nStates.\n\nThis data set was compiled originally to provide the National Water Quality\nAssessment (NAWQA) study units with an intermediate- scale river basin boundary\nfor extracting other GIS data layers. The data can also be used for\nillustration purposes at intermediate or small scales (1:250,000 to 1:2\nmillion).\n\n[Summary provided by EPA]",
