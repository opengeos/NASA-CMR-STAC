    "description": "The maps shows the limit of the gray limestone aquifer in southern Florida. The lower Tamiami aquifer is mapped as being present in most of western and northeastern Hendry County, which are outside of the study area. However, the limestones of the Tamiami Formation, which are included in the lower Tamiami aquifer, thin to the north, and sand and sandstone layers make up most of the thickness of the formation in central Hendry County. The easternmost extent of the gray limestone aquifer corresponds closely to the limits previously delineated by Fish (1988) and Fish and Stewart (1991). In northeastern Broward County, the eastern edge of the aquifer occurs at the transition from highly permeable limestone or contiguous shell sand to a significantly less permeable facies composed of sandy, clayey limestone and quartz sand and sandstone. In northeastern Miami-Dade County, the eastern limit of the aquifer is mapped where the aquifer merges with the Biscayne aquifer and the intervening semiconfining unit wedges out. South of the Tamiami Trail, the eastern boundary occurs at a transition to less-permeable siliciclastic sediments. The northern and western extents of the gray limestone aquifer were not defined in this study.\n      \n      The purpose of this report is to evaluate the hydrogeologic framework, hydraulic properties, and ground-water flow of the gray limestone aquifer in southern Florida. The report also emphasizes the geologic framework (stratigraphy and structure) and the hydrogeologic framework (aquifers and confining and semiconfining units) above and below the gray limestone aquifer.",
