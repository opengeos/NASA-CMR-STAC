    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science). The ECOSTRESS Tiled Evapotranspiration disALEXI 24-Hour L3 CONUS 70 m v002 (ECO_L3T_ET_ALEXI) Version 2 data product provides estimates of daily evapotranspiration (ET) using the ECOSTRESS Level 2 (L2) land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) product, along with the Atmospheric Land Exchange Interface (ALEXI) model, Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) ET model, NDVI and albedo from STARS, and meteorology from Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CSFR). The ECO_L3T_ET_ALEXI data product is derived using a physics-based surface energy balance (SEB) algorithm, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (DisALEXI). Described in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD), DisALEXI is based on spatial disaggregation of regional-scale fluxes from the ALEXI SEB model. There are many approaches for spatially mapping ET; however, SEB methods are favored for remote sensing retrievals based on land-surface temperature. ALEXI was initially developed for managed landscapes and has now been evaluated in comparison with micrometeorological flux tower observations over crop, forest, grassland, wetland, and semiarid desert sites. Applications include crop water use, crop phenology monitoring, and drought early warning or water stress detection. The ECO_L3T_ET_ALEXI Version 2 data product is available for CONUS in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format for CONUS and uses a modified version of the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) (https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/), which divides Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zones into square tiles that are 109.8 km by 109.8 km at 70 m spatial resolution. Each granule contains separate COG files for each layer: Evapotranspiration Daily and Evapotranspiration Daily Uncertainty. A low-resolution browse is also available showing daily ET as a stretched image with a color ramp in JPEG format. ",
