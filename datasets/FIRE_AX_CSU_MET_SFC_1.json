    "description": "The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general circulation models (GCMs). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud data.To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 - July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992). Each mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical processes of the cloud system.The surface radiation and meteorological data collection employed data loggers from Campbell Scientific Inc. The Campbell Model 207 unit measured temperature and relative humidity using two sensors combined into one probe. Wind speed and direction were monitored using a propeller anemometer manufactured by R.M. Young. Irradiance (solar total and near infrared) were measured using an Eppley Pyranometer and infrared irradiance and dome and sink temperatures were measured using an Epply Pyrgeometer.",
