    "description": "The GRIP Flight Tracks and Animations dataset includes both KML files and animation files. The KML files use Google Earth to show the flight tracks on a map. The animations vary by type. Created by the Real-time Mission Monitor (RTMM) software, the .avi files show the flight track versus time superimposed over the GOES Infrared (IR) data from August 13, 2010 to September 25, 2010. The National SubOrbital Education and Research Center provided a file in two formats (.mov, .mp4) viewing hurricane Earl from the NASA DC-8 aircraft. Also a NBC newscast informs the public of the GRIP's goals during the campaign. he major goal was to better understand how tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes. NASA used the DC-8 aircraft, the WB-57 aircraft and the Global Hawk Unmanned Airborne System (UAS), configured with a suite of in situ and remote sensing instruments that were used to observe and characterize the lifecycle of hurricanes. This campaign also capitalized on a number of ground networks and space-based assets, in addition to the instruments deployed on aircraft from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida ( DC-8), Houston, Texas (WB-57), and NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, California (Global Hawk).",
