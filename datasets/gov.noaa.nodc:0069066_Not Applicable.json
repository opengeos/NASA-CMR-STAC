    "description": "Chemical, physical, profile and laboratory analysis oceanographic data were collected aboard the Ferrel in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-07-07 to 2010-08-27 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include CDOM fluorescence, Semivolatile Organic Compounds, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH), Volatile Organic Compounds, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, hydrostatic pressure, salinity, sound velocity, temperature and water density. The instruments used to collect these data included CTD, bottle, fluorometer and oxygen meter along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. This data set also contains products created for use in real time analysis and decision support. These products may include charts, graphs, maps, plots, and GIS formatted data files. The CTD data underwent preliminary quality assurance and control procedures at the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC). The analytical chemistry data are provisional and provide results of onshore laboratory analysis of water and sediment samples. Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers.
