    "description": "TOL2O3_3 is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)/Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 2 Ozone (O3) Nadir Version 3 data product. It was derived from TES Nadir and OMI hyper-spectral measurements from the Aura satellite and jointly estimated an atmospheric ozone (O3) profile with extended vertical range compared to profiles retrieved from the individual measurement.  TES was an instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite and was launched from California on July 15, 2004. Data collection for TES is complete.\r\rTES and OMI stand-alone O3 profile retrievals were largely complementary, with TES infrared (IR) measurements being largely sensitive to the lower to middle troposphere while OMI total column O3 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. TES nadir, which point directly to the surface of the Earth, and OMI locations were paired within 6-8 min and within 220 km. The paired radiance measurements of the two instruments in each location were optimally combined to retrieve a single O3 profile along with other trace gases whose signal interfereed with that from O3. This combined O3 profile had a vertical resolution and vertical range that was an improvement over the two stand-alone products, especially in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. This Aura TES-OMI O3 product used TES and OMI processing results and provided a unique data set for studying tropospheric transport of air pollutants and troposphere-stratospheric exchange processes.",
