    "description": "This data set is Illumina 16s (bacterial) amplicon sequencing data for the Macquarie Island mesocosm ecotoxicology study.\nIn-situ soil mesocosms (n=20) were set up on Macquarie Island in February 2013. Following a year\u2019s equilibration, mesocosms were spiked in triplicate with a fuel mixture mimicking the composition of aged fuel spills on Macquarie Island, in addition to five solvent-only controls. Spiking concentrations range from 50mg/kg to 10000 mg/kg, all in triplicate, in addition to 5 solvent \u2013 only controls.  Soils have been sampled from initial set up until April 2015, with a total of 2 pre-spike and 4 post-spike sample sets. \n\nDNA was extracted from soil in triplicate. Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer analysis (ARISA) was conducted for both Fungal and Bacterial soil communities across all extractions (n = 270).  ARISA results confirmed uniformity of replicate extractions. One replicate for each sample was selected for further work (n=90).\n\nIllumina sequencing was conducted with the 90 samples and these samples correspond with those also selected for microfluidic qPCR. See Thesis in publications section for more details. \n\nThis data was processed in Mothur, using only the forward read. Missing samples are due to quality control, and duplicate samples are due to re-run in a subsequent Illumina submission. Three spreadsheets are included; \n- OTU abundance by sample, which is the key output document following processing in Mothur\n- OTU taxonomy classification, which identifies each OUT\n- Illumina with Enviro for Primer, which is a processed copy of the first document, together with key environmental data, for use in multivariate analysis and cross-referencing with microfluidic qPCR data . 'Environmental' tab provides additional data on samples, including TPH data and vegetation observations at one time point (expressed as percentage of coverage). Contact Sarah Houlahan for more information on chemical data.\n\nOTU = operational taxonomic unit.\n\nSample Set/Action ### Date ### Weeks after spiking\n\nEstablishment ### 17/01/2013 ### -45 weeks\nP1 ### 01/02/2013 ### -43 weeks\nP2 ### 30/10/2013 ### -3 weeks\nSpiking ### 19-25/11/2013 ### 0 weeks\nT1 ### 10/12/2013 ### 2 weeks\nT2 ### 30/03/2014 ### 18 weeks\nT3 ### 07/01/2015 ### 59 weeks\nT4 ### 24/03/2015 ### 69 weeks",
