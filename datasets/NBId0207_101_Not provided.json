    "description": "The IGADD (Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development)\ncrop zones dataset is part of the Africa UNEP/FAO/ESRI Crops Data. The\nmaps were prepared by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI),\nUSA.  The data was provided by Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO), the Soil Resources, Management and Conservation Service, Land\nand Water Development Division, Italy.  The datasets were then\ndeveloped in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Program\n(UNEP), Kenya.\n\nThe base maps used were the UNESCO/FAO Soil Map of the world (1977) in\nMiller Oblated Stereographic projection, the Administrative Units map\nand the World Atlas of Agriculture (1969). All sources were\nre-registered to the base map by comparing known features on the base\nmap and the source maps.  In the original Database (Africa), a\nconsiderable study was made of crop water requirements for a range of\ncrops in the various African climates during the time of the year when\nirrigation would be required.  It was found that a relatively simple\nrelationship exists between annual rainfall and the crop irrigation\nwater requirements for the African food grain crops.  It was also\nobserved that water requirements for food grains vary between fruit\nand vegetable crops on the one side and fiber crops and fodder on the\nother.  No attempt was made to produce complex crop patterns.  There\nis a maximum of 13 crop types in one country.\n\nReferences:\nESRI.
