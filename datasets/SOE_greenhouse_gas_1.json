The average rise is about half that expected from human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuel. Thus observations of the concentration of these gases provides a measure of anthropogenic greenhouse forcing in the atmosphere, and for example, monitors the effectiveness of oceans and terrestrial biomes in removing the excess CO2.\n\nMeasurements of long-lived trace gas levels in Antarctic air generally provide an accurate integration of global exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. The climate-influencing gases of main interest are gases released as a result of human activity, as well as from (climate-driven) physical, chemical and biological processes in both land and oceans. The Antarctic monitoring, in concert with other global network results, exploits trace gas ratios to identify and locate globally significant exchanges.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial Scale: High latitude Southern Hemisphere air samples are collected from AAD sites by BoM personnel at Mawson station, Casey station and Macquarie Island, and by NOAA staff at South Pole. These complement CSIRO supervised sites at Cape Grim, Tasmania and ~7 other globally distributed locations.\n\nFrequency: Typical sites collect ~4 flasks of air per month for subsequent analysis at CSIRO.\n\nMeasurement Technique: Various chemical analysis techniques (Francey et al. 1996).\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nFor global trace gas monitoring, improvements are sought in network intercalibration and in increased sampling, e.g. continuous CO2 monitoring, vertical profiles, continental sites. More generally, improved coordination of atmospheric composition modeling, surface flux measurements and atmospheric transport representations are sought to serve new 'multiple-constraint modeling frameworks'.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nMonthly averages of daily maximum and minimum temperatures for Australian Antarctic Stations\nMean sea level Average Summer chlorophyll concentrations in the Southern Ocean, from latitude bands 40-50 deg S, 50-60 deg S, 60 deg S-continent\nAverage sea surface temperatures in latitude bands 40-50 deg S, 50-60 deg S, 60 deg S-continent\nAntarctic sea ice extent and concentration",
