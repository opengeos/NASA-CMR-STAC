    "description": "The data reports the pigment concentrations and results of CHEMTAX analysis for 2 summer seasons in Antarctic. In 2008/09 three experiments in which 6 x 650 l minicosms (polythene tanks) were used to incubate natural microbial communities (less than 200 um diameter) at a range of CO2 concentrations while maintained at constant light, temperature and mixing. The communities were pumped from ice-free water ~60 m offshore on 30/12/08, 20/01/09 and 09/02/09. These experiments received no acclimation to CO2 treatment. A further experiment was performed in 2014/15 using water helicoptered from ~ 1 km offshore amongst decomposing fast ice on 19/11/14. This experiment included a 5 day period during which the community was exposed top low light and the CO2 was gradually raised to the target value for each tank, followed by a two day period when the light was raised to an irradiance that was saturating but not inhibitory for photosynthesis. \nA range of coincident measurements were performed to quantify the structure and function of the microbial community (see Davidson et al. 2016 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 552: 93\u2013113, doi: 10.3354/meps11742 and Thomson et al 2016 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 554: 51\u201369, 2016, doi: 10.3354/meps11803).\nThe data provides a matrix of samples against component pigment concentration and the output from CHEMTAX that best explained the phytoplankton composition of the community based on the ratios of the component pigments. \nFor the 2008/09 experiments, samples were obtained every 2 days for 10, 12 and 10 days in experiments 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In 2014/15 samples were obtained from each incubation tank on days 1,3, 5, and 8 during th acclimation period and every 2 days until day 18 thereafter. For each sample a measured volume was filtered through 13 mm Whatman GF/F filters for 20 mins. Filters were folded in half, blotted dry, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis in Australia. Pigments were extracted, analysed by HPLC, and quantified following the methods of Wright et al. (2010). Pigments (including Chl a) were extracted from filters with 300 micro l dimethylformamide plus 50 micro l methanol, containing 140 ng apo-8'-carotenal (Fluka) internal standard, followed by bead beating and centrifugation to separate the extract from particulate matter. Extracts (125 micro l) were diluted to 80% with water and analysed on a Waters HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C8 column and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Pigments were identified by comparing retention times and spectra to a mixed standard sample from known cultures (Jeffrey and Wright, 1997), run daily before samples. Peak integrations were performed using Waters Empower software, checked manually for corrections, and quantified using the internal standard method (Mantoura and Repeta, 1997).",
