    "description": "Availability of Biodiversity Information for East Africa\n      \n      Launched in 1992 at the Conference Conservation of Biodiversity in\n      Africa, Nairobi, the project represents a survey of the sources and types\n      of information held on biodiversity for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda by\n      organisations both within and outside East Africa. The project came about\n      in response to the need for a systematic review of data holdings for the\n      region in support of conservation and sustainable development. This need\n      has been subsequently underscored by provisions in the Convention on\n      Biological Diversity calling for contracting parties to develop national\n      strategies, plans or programmes, assisted by such baseline information.\n      \n      The study was a collaborative venture between the IUCN Regional Office\n      for Eastern Africa (EARO), the World Conservation Monitoring Centre\n      (WCMC), and key national institutions in each of the three countries.\n      Funding was provided by The European Commission (B7-5040 Contract\n      92/11) and through a contract with the Food and Agriculture Organization\n      of the United Nations, executing agency for a GEF/UNDP project entitled\n      Institutional Support for the Protection of East African Biodiversity\n      (UNO/RAF/006/GEF).\n      \n      Information for the study was collected using a standard questionnaire\n      design, administered by means of face to face interviews for the majority\n      of the 100 institutions surveyed within East Africa, by mailing the\n      questionnaire to more than 1000 institutions outside the region, and by\n      posting the questionnaire on \"News\", a global electronic bulletin board,\n      with the potential of reaching another 1 million+ subscribers.\n      \n      A total of 350 questionnaires were completed and returned, the results\n      of which were used in the production of the following outputs:\n      \n        The creation of a \"data sources\" database (metadatabase) of the\n        sources and types of biodiversity information held for the region\n      \n        The production of a printed report including (1) summary\n        information and analysis of results in terms of taxonomic and\n        geographic coverage of biodiversity information; and (2) a catalogue\n        of questionnaire entries\n      \n        Presentation of catalogue entries in Folio Views text-retrieval\n        software, with accompanying User's Guide\n      \n      Important follow-up to this study includes forthcoming publication and\n      distribution of hard-copy and electronic outputs, maintenance and\n      updating of the database, ongoing provision of training in information\n      collection and database use, and general support for biodiversity\n      initiatives by promoting networking between institutions and accessibility\n      to information. Consideration is being given to extending the study to\n      other regions of Africa and elsewhere, and the experience gained from\n      this initiative is being used in support of larger institutional capacity\n      building projects currently being undertaken at WCMC.\n      \n      \n      LANGUAGE:\n        English\n      \n      STATISTICAL INFORMATION:\n      \n      ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION:\n      \n      WCMC makes information available through published media, through provision\n      of datasets, and through the provision of either standard or customised reports.\n      WCMC is committed to the principle of the free exchange of data with other\n      institutions and users. In so far as is practical, it places its data in the\n      public domain and encourages their wide distribution. However, costs may be\n      incurred in accessing and distributing datasets, and where analysis and\n      assessment provide an added-value service. Such costs are passed on to the\n      user.",
