    "description": "INPE's only receiving station for ERS-1 and ERS-2 SAR is located in\n      Cuiaba, MT (geographic coordinates approx. 15.5S/56.0W). The SAR tapes\n      recorded at Cuiaba are air shipped to the processing and distribution\n      center in Cachoeira Paulista, SP, where they are kept. A copy of all\n      recorded tapes is sent to the ESA PAF at the DLR facilities in\n      Germany.\n      \n      Early ERS-1 SAR data were acquired primarily for station checkout and\n      Principal Investigator service. A small number of passes, 15 seconds\n      to 2 minutes long, were acquired from August, 1991 to March, 1992,\n      during the Commissioning and Ice phases where the repeat cycle was 3\n      days but the ground coverage was sparse. More extensive and regular\n      acquisitions began in April, 1992, with the satellite already in the\n      so-called Multidisciplinary phase (full ground coverage and 35-day\n      repeat cycle).\n      \n      INPE is allowed to service user requests originated in Brazil\n      only. Only digital products are available. Requests for products and\n      for image search listings will be handled directly by the processing\n      center (listed at the Data Center entry), through contacts by mail,\n      phone or fax. No online remote access is available, although plans\n      exist to implement it, including the International Directory\n      protocols. No firm date is speculated for that, but hopes are that it\n      can be made before 1998.\n      \n      Requests from countries other that Brazil must be routed to the ESA\n      licensed regional distributors. Information can be obtained with the\n      ESA ERS-1 Order Desk, c/o ESRIN, C.P. 64, I-00044 Frascati, Italy. The\n      phone numbers are +39.6.941-80600 (voice) and +39.6.941-80510 (fax).",
