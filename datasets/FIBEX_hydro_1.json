    "description": "This dataset contains hydroacoustic results from the First International Biomass Experiment (FIBEX) cruise of the Nella Dan. This cruise is the first in a series of six cruises, performing a long term survey of krill and other zooplankton distribution and abundance. FIBEX was an international project, done in co-operation with Japan, South Africa and France.  Fourteen transects were made by Australia off Antarctica in the Australian sector (Mawson to Davis region) and Prydz Bay in January to March 1981, covering a survey area of 1.09x10^6 square kilometers. Quantitative and geographic krill distribution, abundance, mean and variance of the krill weight density, and total krill biomass were obtained. The standing stock of krill for the Prydz Bay region was calculated at the second workshop to be approximately 1.3 million tonnes, or 1.6 million tonnes if extrapolated over the survey area of the SIBEX II cruise. Temperature, nutrient and salinty data were also obtained, as well as trawl results. Summary results are listed in the documentation.",
