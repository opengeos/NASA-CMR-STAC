    "description": "Atmospheric and oceanic carbon monoxide in the marine boundary layer was monitored from November 26, 2010, to January 22, 2011, using a RGA gas chromatograph along the cruise track of R/V Polarstern from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Wellington, New Zealand, carrying out the expedition, ANTXXVI/2, in the Southern Ocean. The air inlet to the instrument was located at ~30 m asl and the sea water inlet was located at 7m depth. CO was measured every 45 minutes.\nAtmospheric carbon monoxide plays a key role in tropospheric chemistry in particular related to the oxidation capacity and to understanding the chemical processes in the marine boundary layer. Also underway continuous measurement of CO enables us to estimate marine emission of CO in global scale.",
