    "description": "The fate of pollutants in Antarctic soils - to what extent soluble and insoluble materials move through, out of, or become fixed in soils, was investigated. Soil samples from a number of sites at Marble Point were collected and retained for chemical analyses. Soils at Marble Point were examined at two fuel spill sites (one old and one modern) and the influence of permafrost on the movement of hydrocarbons was assessed. At several sites where there was evidence of contaminants in the soils (i.e. oils, salts from lead batteries and copper pipes etc.), the soils were sampled for chemical analyses to determine the nature of leaching processes and the relationship and reaction of contaminants with the permafrost. Additional samples were collected at the battery site to see if lateral movement of contaminants had occurred. At the undisturbed sites, samples were also retained for chemical analyses to provide baseline chemical reference data. As well as recording data about the nature of each site, surface characteristics relevant to land stability and regenerative processes were recorded over a much wider area.",
