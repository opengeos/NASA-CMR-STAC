    "description": "Anadromous fish populations historically have found healthy habitat in Jordan\nCreek, Juneau, Alaska. Concern regarding potential degradation to the habitat\nby urban development within the Mendenhall Valley led to a cooperative study\namong the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska Department of Environmental\nConservation, and the U.S. Geological Survey, that assessed current hydrologic,\nwater-quality, and physical-habitat conditions of the stream corridor.\n\nPeriods of no streamflow were not uncommon at the Jordan Creek below Egan Drive\nnear Auke Bay stream gaging station. Additional flow measurements indicate that\nperiods of no flow are more frequent downstream of the gaging station. Although\nperiods of no flow typically were in March and April, streamflow measurements\ncollected prior to 1999 indicate similar periods in January, suggesting that no\nflow conditions may occur at any time during the winter months. This dewatering\nin the lower reaches likely limits fish rearing and spawning habitat as well as\nlimiting the migration of juvenile salmon out to the ocean during some years.\n\nDissolved-oxygen concentrations may not be suitable for fish survival during\nsome winter periods in the Jordan Creek watershed. Dissolved-oxygen\nconcentrations were measured as low as 2.8 mg/L at the gaging station and were\nmeasured as low as 0.85 mg/L in a tributary to Jordan Creek. Intermittent\nmeasurements of pH and dissolved-oxygen concentrations in the mid-reaches of\nJordan Creek were all within acceptable limits for fish survival, however, few\nmeasurements of these parameters were made during winter-low-flow conditions.\nOne set of water quality samples was collected at six different sites in the\nJordan Creek watershed and analyzed for major ions and dissolved nutrients.\nMajor-ion chemistry showed Jordan Creek is calcium bicarbonate type water with\nlittle variation between sampling sites. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
