    "description": "These images are infrared thermal images of points in and around Casey station. Thermal images were taken using a Testo 881 Thermal Imaging Camera. The thermal imaging camera records infrared radiation of a particular area. These radiation values are then translated on the camera into apparent temperature by calculating the temperature using the heat transfer equation q=sigma epsilon T4, where q is the heat transfer per unit area (W/m2,) sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.6703x10-8 (W/m2K4)), T is the apparent temperature (K) and epsilon is the emissivity. The inferred temperature relies on an assumed emissivity. Because actual emissivity is not fixed, the apparent temperature does not necessarily translate into actual temperature. As such, care should be taken when interpreting the thermal image files. The emissivity value can be adjusted later using IRSoft software (see below).\n\nFile name       Description\nIV_00903.BMT    Bar fridge\nIV_00904.BMT    Bar fridge\nIV_00908.BMT    TV next to pool table\nIV_00909.BMT    TV next to pool table\nIV_00910.BMT    Library window\nIV_00911.BMT    Library window\nIV_00912.BMT    Main cold porch\nIV_00913.BMT    Main cold porch\nIV_00914.BMT    Main cold porch\nIV_00915.BMT    Main cold porch\nIV_00916.BMT    Main cold porch\nIV_00917.BMT    Mess hall, main three door fridge\nIV_00918.BMT    Mess hall, main three door fridge\nIV_00919.BMT    Coffee machine\nIV_00920.BMT    Catch and kill fridge and upright freezer\nIV_00921.BMT    Door to chef's fridge\nIV_00922.BMT    Catch and kill fridge and upright freezer\nIV_00923.BMT    Refrigertion units in kitchen\nIV_00924.BMT    Wallow\nIV_00925.BMT    Wallow\nIV_00926.BMT    Main cold porch\nIV_00927.BMT    West side of redshed, ice build-up from blizz tail\nIV_00928.BMT    West side of redshed, ice build-up from blizz tail\nIV_00929.BMT    West side of redshed, ice build-up from blizz tail\nIV_00930.BMT    South side of redshed\nIV_00931.BMT    South side of redshed\nIV_00932.BMT    South side of redshed\nIV_00934.BMT    Ops building\nIV_00935.BMT    Ops building, west side, ice build-up from blizz-tail\nIV_00936.BMT    Ops building, main door\nIV_00937.BMT    Ops building, main door\nIV_00939.BMT    Ops building, west side, ice build-up from blizz-tail\nIV_00950.BMT    Central Wallow Orignal triple glaze, ground floor, immediately west of point 3\nIV_00951.BMT    Central Wallow Orignal triple glaze, ground floor, immediately west of point 3\nIV_00952.BMT    Central Wallow NE facing pane on bay window\nIV_00953.BMT    Central Wallow NE facing pane on bay window\nIV_00954.BMT    West wing skylight, immediately above landing in second floor.
