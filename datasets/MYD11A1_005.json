    "description": "The MYD11A1.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua LST/E L3 Global 1 Km Grid (Short name: MYD11A1) products incorporate 1-km pixels, which are produced daily using the generalized split-window LST algorithm. This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of atmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into tractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in Bands 31 and 32 are estimated from land cover types.\r\n\r\nMYD11A1 products are projected in a Sinusoidal grid by mapping the level-2 LST product (MYD11_L2) on 1-kilometer (precisely 0.928-km) grids. The MYD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and Bands 31 and 32 emissivities from land cover types.\r\n\r\nAqua/MODIS V5  LST/E products, including MYD11A1, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\nThe V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.  Please refer to the LP DAAC MODIS product table at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/myd11a1  for additional detailed product version information.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~4 MB \r\nResolution: ~1 kilometer (actual: 0.93km) \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 12\r\nTemporal Range: 2002-07-08 to 2017-03-31",
