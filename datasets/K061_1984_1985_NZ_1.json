    "description": "Aspects of the ecology and physiology of protozoa found in glacial melt waters of the Wright and Taylor Valleys were studied. Combined water/substrate samples and freeze dried moss and algae were collected from six known glacial meltwater streams and stream beds flowing in to Lake Fryxell (Taylor Valley) and seven flowing in to Lake Vanda (Wright Valley). Mixed water/substrate samples were examined to determine the number and density of species present. Representative samples of each species were fixed for examination with the scanning and transmission electron microscope and the ability of the protozoa present to tolerate freeze drying under various conditions was investigated.",
