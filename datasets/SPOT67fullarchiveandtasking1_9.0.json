    "description": "The SPOT 6 and 7 satellites ensure data continuity with the no longer operational SPOT 5 satellite and provide an archive of very high resolution optical acquisition as well as the possibility to task the satellites for new acquisitions.\rFollowing the completion of the SPOT 7 mission in March 2023, new acquisition tasking is only available for the SPOT 6 satellite.\rThe ortho-products are automatically generated by the SPOT 6 and 7 ground segment, based on SRTM database or Reference3D when available. The projection available for SPOT 6 and 7 ortho-products is UTM, datum WGS84.\rBands combinations:\r\u2022\tPanchromatic: black&amp;white image at 1.5 m resolution\r\u2022\tPansharpened: 3-bands or 4 bands colour image at 1.5 m resolution\r\u2022\tMultispectral: 4 bands image at 6m resolution \r\u2022\tBundle: 1.5 m panchromatic image and 6 m multispectral image, co-registered.\rGeometric processing levels:\r\u2022\tPrimary: The Primary product is the processing level closest to the natural image acquired by the sensor. This product restores perfect collection conditions: the sensor is placed in rectilinear geometry, and the image is clear of all radiometric distortion.\r\u2022\tOrtho: The Ortho product is a georeferenced image in Earth geometry, corrected from acquisition and terrain off-nadir effects. Available in MONO acquisition mode only.\rAcquisition modes:\r\u2022\tMono\r\u2022\tStereo\r\u2022\tTristero\r\rTo complement the traditional and fully customised ordering and download of selected SPOT, Pleiades or Pleiades Neo images in a variety of data formats, you can also subscribe to the OneAtlas Living Library package where the entire OneAtlas optical archive of ortho images is updated on a daily basis and made available for streaming or download.\rThe Living Library consist of\r\u2022\tless-than-18-months-old imagery\r\u2022\ta curation of SPOT images with no cloud cover and less than 30\u00b0 incidence angle\r\u2022\tPl\u00e9iades images acquired worldwide with maximum 15% cloud cover and 30\u00b0 Incidence Angle\r\u2022\tPl\u00e9iades Neo premium imagery selection with 2% cloud cover and 30\u00b0 incidence angle\rThese are the available subscription packages (to be consumed withing one year from the activation) \rOneAtlas Living Library subscription package 1: up to 230 km2 Pleiades Neo or 430 km2 Pleiades or 1.500 km2 SPOT in download, up to 500 km2 Pleiades Neo or 2.000 km2 Pleiades or 7.500 km2 SPOT in streaming\rOneAtlas Living Library subscription package 2: up to 654 km2 Pleiades Neo or 1.214 km2 Pleiades or 4.250 km2 SPOT in download, up to 1417 km2 Pleiades Neo or 5.666 km2 Pleiades or 21.250 km2 SPOT in streaming\rOneAtlas Living Library subscription package 3: up to 1.161 km2 Pleiades Neo or 2.156 km2 Pleiades or 7.545 km2 SPOT in download, up to 2.515 km2 Pleiades Neo or 10.060 km2 Pleiades or 37.723 km2 SPOT in streaming\rAs per ESA policy, very high-resolution imagery of conflict areas cannot be provided.",
