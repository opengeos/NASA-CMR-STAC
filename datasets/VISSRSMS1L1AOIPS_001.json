    "description": "VISSRSMS1L1AOIPS is the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) Level 1 Atmospheric and Oceanographic Image Processing System (AOIPS) data product from the first Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (SMS-1). There are typically three data files for a scene of the Earth with radiances that were measured in the visible (0.55 to 0.70 micrometer) and/or IR (10.5 to 12.6 micrometer) wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 0.9 and 8 km, respectively. Files also include time, geolocation, orbit, attitude, and telemetry information. There are three types of data files in this product: one contains IR data, one contains the IR grid information (blank before 1974/10/29), and another contains VIS data. Each data file is structured with an AOIPS label, followed by an IPD label, and then an optional 8 telemetry records followed by a set of data records. Visible data are typically 3904 pixels by either 4000 or 2000 scan lines (5 or 2.5 minute scenes respectively). IR data are typically 976 pixels by either 500 or 250 scan lines (5 or 2.5 minute scenes respectively). A full scan of the Earth was made every 20 minutes.\n\nThe data were used to make 70mm film negatives and 9.5\u201d positive prints on a Dicomed Image Recording System.  Data for this product are available from 1974/07/01 through 1979/04/19 (with gaps plus no data between 1975/08/20 and 1979/02/17). The SMS-1 satellite was initially parked over the equator at longitude 45W on June 7, 1974 viewing the hemisphere below the satellite to support the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE). It was moved to its operational position at 75W on Nov 15, 1974 where it remained until GOES-1 was launched, after which SMS 1 was moved to 105W and placed in stand-by-mode as a backup to GOES-1 or SMS-2. The VISSR experiment was operated by the NOAA National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS), as well as scientists from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nThis product was previously available from the NSSDC with the identifier ESAD-00018 (old ID 74-033A-01D).",
