    "description": "In 1968 the Australian Antarctic Division had a team of four people spend just over a year on the Amery Ice Shelf, undertaking a range of studies including ice velocity determination (horizontal and vertical), ice thickness and surface profile measurements, snow accumulation studies, investigation of temperature, density and crystal structure of the ice, continuous measurements of wind velocities, air and snow temperatures, air pressure, humidity, and radiation.\n\nMany journals were kept during the traverse, detailing general daily activities carried out, but also including assorted measurements and observations that weren't specifically recorded in stand-alone logs.\n\nAll logbooks have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nCopies of the document details forms for the logbooks is available for download from the provided URL.\n\nAMERY ICE SHELF PARTY - February 1968 to February 1969\nall IN on V2(67-68) all OUT on V2(68-69)\nOfficer-in-Charge: Maxwell John Corry\nMedical Officer: Julian R Sansom\nEngineer(Electronics): Alan H F Nickols\nSenior Diesel Mechanic: Neville Joseph Collins\n\nConducted a glaciological program including ice drilling and surveying the \nLambert Glacier",
