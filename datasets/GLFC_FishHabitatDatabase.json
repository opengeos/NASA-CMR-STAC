    "description": "The Fish Habitat Database is a synthesis of extensive information on habitat\nrequirements and characteristics of selected Great Lakes fish species.\nSponsored by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission through its Habitat Advisory\nBoard, the Fish Habitat Database was developed in response to a need for\nhabitat information on Great Lakes fish species. This need was identified in\npart in the Joint Strategic Plan for Management of the Great Lakes Fisheries.\nIn addition, natural resource managers from environmental agencies indicated a\nneed for fish habitat data in order to develop and implement Fish Management\nPlans, Lakewide Management Plans, and Remedial Action Plans that recognize fish\nas an integral component of the Great Lakes ecosystem. The database potentially\ncontains habitat information for 18 selected fish species at five stages of\ntheir life and in six bodies of water. This information was obtained primarily\nfrom the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Habitat Suitability Index Models and\nother data where available. This version of the database is not the final\nproduct. In fact, information gaps are present in this version. The database is\nintended to be an ongoing effort which will need maintenance as new needs are\nidentified and new information is discovered. The Great Lakes Fishery\nCommission is seeking an individual or agency that will be able to take over\nthis role on behalf of other users in the Great Lakes basin.",
