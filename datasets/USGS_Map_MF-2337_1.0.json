    "description": "This database and accompanying plot files depict the distribution of geologic\nmaterials and structures at a regional (1:62,500) scale.  The report is\nintended to provide geologic information for the regional study of materials\nproperties, earthquake shaking, landslide potential, mineral hazards, seismic\nvelocity, and earthquake faults. In addition, the report contains new\ninformation and interpretations about the regional geologic history and\nframework.  However, the regional scale of this report does not provide\nsufficient detail for site development purposes.  In addition, this map does\nnot take the place of fault-rupture hazard zones designated by the California\nState Geologist (Hart and Bryant, 1997).  Similarly, the database cannot be\nused to identify or delineate landslides in the region.\n\nThis digital map database, compiled from previously published and unpublished\ndata, and new mapping by the authors, represents the general distribution of\nbedrock and surficial deposits in the mapped area. Together with the\naccompanying text file (mageo.txt, mageo.pdf, or mageo.ps), it provides current\ninformation on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the area covered. \nThe database delineates map units that are identified by general age and\nlithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution (scale) of\nthe database to 1:62,500 or smaller.\n\nThe databases in this report were compiled in ARC/INFO, a commercial Geographic\nInformation System (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands,\nCalifornia), with version 3.0 of the menu interface ALACARTE (Fitzgibbon and\nWentworth, 1991, Fitzgibbon, 1991, Wentworth and Fitzgibbon, 1991).  The files\nare in either GRID (ARC/INFO raster data) format or COVERAGE (ARC/INFO vector\ndata) format.  Coverages are stored in uncompressed ARC export format (ARC/INFO\nversion 7.x).  ARC/INFO export files (files with the .e00 extension) can be\nconverted into ARC/INFO coverages in ARC/INFO (see below) and can be read by\nsome other Geographic Information Systems, such as MapInfo via ArcLink and\nESRI's ArcView (version 1.0 for Windows 3.1 to 3.11 is available for free from\nESRI's web site: http://www.esri.com ). The digital compilation was done in\nversion 7.1.1 of ARC/INFO with version 3.0 of the menu interface ALACARTE\n(Fitzgibbon and Wentworth, 1991, Fitzgibbon, 1991, Wentworth and Fitzgibbon,\n1991).\n\nThe geologic map information was digitized from stable originals of the\ngeologic maps at 1:62,500 scale.  The author manuscripts (pen on mylar) were\nscanned using a Altek monochrome scanner with a resolution of 800 dots per\ninch.  The scanned images were vectorized and transformed from scanner\ncoordinates to projection coordinates with digital tics placed by hand at\nquadrangle corners.  The scanned lines were edited interactively by hand using\nALACARTE, color boundaries were tagged as appropriate, and scanning artifacts\nvisible at 1:24,000 were removed.\n\nRevisions:\n8/31/99  This is the pre-release version of the report.  There have been no\nrevisions to any part of the report.\n\nData Revision List\n>  File        Report Version        Last Update\n>              Last Updated\n>\n>  mamap.ps      1.0\n>  maexpl.ps     1.0\n>  mageo.ps      1.0\n>  mamap.pdf     1.0\n>  maexpl.pdf    1.0\n>  mageo.pdf     1.0\n>  ma-geol.e00   1.0\n>  ma-strc.e00   1.0\n>  ma-blks.e00   1.0\n>  ma-altr.e00   1.0\n>  ma-quad.e00   1.0\n>  ma-corr.e00   1.0\n>  ma-so.e00     1.0\n>  ma-terr.e00   1.0\n>  mageo.txt     1.0\n>  mafig1.tif    1.0\n>  mafig2.tif    1.0\n>  madb.ps       1.0\n>  madb.pdf      1.0\n>  madb.txt      1.0\n>  import.aml    1.0\n>  mageol.met    1.0\n\nReviews_Applied_to_Data:\n\nThis report has undergone two scientific peer reviews, one digital database\nreview, one review for conformity with geologic names policy, and review of the\nplotfiles for conformity with USGS map standards.\n\nRelated_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets:\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (Arc/Info\ncoverages) and supporting text and plotfiles.  In addition, the report includes\ntwo sets of plotfiles (PostScript and PDF format) that will generate map sheets\nand pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field Studies Report.\n These files are described below:\n\n>  ARC/INFO     Resultant       Description of Coverage\n>  export file  Coverage\n>  -----------  -----------  --------------------------------\n>  ma-geol.e00  ma-geol/     Polygon and line coverage showing faults,\n>                            depositional contacts, and rock units\n>                            in the map area.\n>\n>  ma-strc.e00  ma-strc/     Point and line coverage showing strike and dip\n>                            information and fold axes.\n>\n>  ma-blks.e00  ma-blks/     Point coverage showing location of high-grade\n>                            blocks in Franciscan rock units.\n>\n>  ma-altr.e00  ma-altr/     Polygon coverage showing areas of hydrothermal\n>                            alteration.\n>\n>  ma-quad.e00  ma-quad/     Line coverage showing index map of quadrangles\n>                            in the map area.
