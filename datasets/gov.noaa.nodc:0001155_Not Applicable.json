    "description": "Biological, physical, nutrients, sediment, and other data were collected using sediment sampler-grab, bottle and CTD casts in the Arabian Sea, North/South Pacific Ocean, and North Atlantic Ocean from 08 January 1995 to 08 April 1998. Data were submitted by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the Long Term Monitoring East-West Flower Garden Banks project. Biological data include detailed information on phytoplankton and zooplankton. Nutrients data includes nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and silicate.\n\nThe U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S. JGOFS), conceived in 1984 and organized as a major ocean research program shortly thereafter, has conducted field and modeling investigations of the global ocean carbon cycle and the processes that regulate it for a decade and a half. It has brought together biological, chemical, physical and geological oceanographers and modelers in a multidisciplinary investigation of the pools and fluxes of carbon and associated biogenic elements in the ocean.\n\nU.S. JGOFS is a component of the international Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), launched in 1987 under the aegis of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). Designated a core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) two years later, JGOFS has involved scientists from more than 30 countries in field and modeling studies. Its research program included national and international process studies conducted in many ocean basins, time-series programs and a global survey of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean.\n\nThe U.S. JGOFS research program comprised four basin-scale process studies, two long-term time-series programs, participation in a global survey of (CO2) and a synthesis and modeling project. This CD-ROM contains the data acquired during the four U.S. JGOFS process studies, conducted in the North Atlantic, the equatorial Pacific, the Arabian Sea and the Southern Ocean. Data from other components of U.S. JGOFS will be published in future volumes.",
