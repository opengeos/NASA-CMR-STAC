    "description": "### Overview  The SUNWELL Modelling Environment is a combination of data and code that models electricity production from satellite-derived irradiance data and other spatial data sets for all of Switzerland. This ensemble accompanies the publication \"The bright side of PV production in snow-covered mountains\", published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science and reproduces all results and figures of. Code and resources are in their original form (with documentation). A new version with a more generalized application to PV modelling and with more flexibility in terms of input and output formats will be released in the coming months.    ### Format  All code is written and has to be executed in Matlab. The input and output data sets are also in the Matlab-specific .mat format. Whenever publicly available, the original data is provided as geotif, .xlsx or other common format.   This is the case for:    - Digital Elevation Model (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/ASTERDEM),   - Landsurface cover type (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/CORINE),   - Population Density (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/popdensRaster,   - Electricity production from three of our validation sites (/Validation/WSL),   - Measured irradiance for two validation sites (/Validation/ASRB)  The \u2018Metadata\u2019 documents in the respective folders provide further information about the data sources and processing. Figures are produced either in .pdf or .png format.     ### Structure  The central level of the SUNWELL environment holds the 5 Mains, which run the different modelling aspects of the paper; each code is documented separately. Additional code is located in the __\u2018DataProcessing\u2019__ and the __\u2018functions\u2019__ folder. Functions are called in the different Mains.    __\u2018InputsFromMatlab\u2019__ contains the radiation and albedo input data sets in separate subfolders (SIS/SISDIR/ALB). The original data is not publicly available, but can be requested for research purposes free of charge. We provide a processed subset of the data set that was used to run the SUNWELL simulations. The MSG subfolder contains additional spatial input data sets.    __\u2018Outputs\u2019__ contains the output files from the different mains (matching names, Main_CHallpixels.m \uf0e0 Prod_CHallpixels)    __\u2018Publication_figures\u2019__ contains all individual figures from the PNAS publication, as well as the generating code (/code_plot) and the power point figures (/ppts) that provide the combined final figures.    __\u2018Validation\u2019__ contains the data sets used in the model validation:    - Electricity production from three of our validation sites (/WSL),   - Measured irradiance for two validation sites (/ASRB)    __Electricity__ production from a validation site at Lac des Toules in Wallis (/LDT), this data set was provided under an NDA and cannot be made publicly available.     __Paper Citation:__   > _Annelen Kahl; J\u00e9r\u00f4me Dujardin; Michael Lehning (2018).
