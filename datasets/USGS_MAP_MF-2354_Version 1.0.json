    "description": "The data set for the Chewelah 30' X 60' quadrangle has been jointly\nprepared by the U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Resource Program, the\nSouthern California Areal Mapping Project (SCAMP), and the Washington\nDivision of Geology and Earth Resources, as part of an ongoing effort to\nutilize a Geographical Information System (GIS) format to create regional\ndigital geologic databases.  These regional databases are being developed\nas contributions to the National Geologic Map Data Base of the National\nCooperative Geologic Mapping Program of the USGS.\n\nThe digital geologic map database for the Chewelah 30' X 60' quadrangle\nhas been created as a general-purpose data set that is applicable to\nother land-related investigations in the earth and biological sciences.\nFor example, it can be used for mineral resource evaluation studies,\nanimal and plant habitat studies, and soil studies in the Colville and\nKaniksu National Forests.  The database is not suitable for site-specific\ngeologic evaluations.\n\nThis data set maps and describes the geology of the Chewelah 30' X 60'\nquadrangle, Washington and Idaho. Created using Environmental Systems\nResearch Institute's ARC/INFO software, the data base consists of the\nfollowing items: (1) a map coverage containing geologic contacts and\nunits, (2) a point coverage containing site-specific geologic structural\ndata, (3) two coverages derived from 1:100,000 Digital Line Graphs (DLG);\none of which represents topographic data, and the other, cultural data,\n(4) two line coverages that contain cross-section lines and unit-label\nleaders, respectively, and (5) attribute tables for geologic units\n(polygons), contacts (arcs), and site-specific data (points).  In\naddition, the data set includes the following graphic and text products:\n(1) A PostScript graphic plot-file containing the geologic map,\ntopography, cultural data, and two cross sections, and on a separate\nsheet, a Correlation of Map Units (CMU) diagram, an abbreviated\nDescription of Map Units (DMU), modal diagrams for granitic rocks, an\nindex map, a regional geologic and structure map, and a key for point and\nline symbols; (2) PDF files of the Readme text-file and expanded\nDescription of Map Units (DMU), and (3) this metadata file.\n\nThe geologic map database contains original U.S. Geological Survey data\ngenerated by detailed field observation and by interpretation of aerial\nphotographs. The map was compiled from geologic maps of eight 1:48,000\n15' quadrangle blocks, each of which was made by mosaicing and reducing\nthe four constituent 7.5' quadrangles.  These 15' quadrangle blocks were\nmapped chiefly at 1:24,000 scale, but the detail of the mapping was\ngoverned by the intention that it was to be compiled at 1:48,000 scale.\nThe compilation at 1:100,000 scale entailed necessary simplification in\nsome areas and combining of some geologic units.  Overall, however,\ndespite a greater than two times reduction in scale, most geologic detail\nfound on the 1:48,000 maps is retained on the 1:100,000 map.  Geologic\ncontacts across boundaries of the eight constituent quadrangles required\nminor adjustments, but none significant at the final 1:100,000 scale.\n\nThe geologic map was compiled on a base-stable cronoflex copy of the\nChewelah 30' X 60' topographic base and then scribed.  The scribe guide\nwas used to make a 0.007 mil-thick blackline clear-film, which was\nscanned at 1200 DPI by Optronics Specialty Company, Northridge,\nCalifornia.  This image was converted to vector and polygon GIS layers\nand minimally attributed by Optronics Specialty Company.  Minor\nhand-digitized additions were made at the USGS.  Lines, points, and\npolygons were subsequently edited at the USGS by using standard\nARC/INFO commands.  Digitizing and editing artifacts significant enough\nto display at a scale of 1:100,000 were corrected. Within the database,\ngeologic contacts are represented as lines (arcs), geologic units as\npolygons, and site-specific data as points.  Polygon, arc, and point\nattribute tables (.pat, .aat, and .pat, respectively) uniquely identify\neach geologic datum.\n\nData package contents:\n>chew_geo.e00   Contacts, faults, geologic unit labels\n>chew_pts.e00   Attitudes and their dip values.
