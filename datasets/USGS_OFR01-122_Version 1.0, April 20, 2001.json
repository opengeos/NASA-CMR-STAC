    "description": "U.S. Geological Survey scientists desired to have the data presented in the\nSource in a digital format to use in GIS and spreadsheet software programs for\naggregate models and aggregate assessment.\n\nThe data set marpits1 is an ArcInfo coverage of point features representing pit\nlocations and attribution data captured from an atlas of map sheets and pit\ndata sheets titled \"A Materials Inventory of Maricopa County [Arizona]\" by the\nArizona Highway Department (AHD), now named the Arizona Department of\nTransportation (ADOT), hereafter referred to as the 'Source'.\n\nPit locations were represented by point symbols in the Source map sheets. \nPoints were digitized from the Source map sheets.  Selected attribute data were\ncollected from the Source pit data and map sheets. In the Source introduction\nit states:\n      \"The pit location maps show the location of all\n      pits bearing Materials Services serial numbers.\n      Other sources are not shown. The plotted locations\n      are as close as possible to the true location\n      as the scale of the map will allow.\"\n\nThe point attribute data, captured from the Source pit data sheets are\n\n     \"designed to show test results (sieve analysis,\n      plasticity index, and abrasion) for the usable\n      material within each ADOT pit.\"\n\nThe digital editor and digital compilers of the GIS data set made certain\nadjustments to the data to make them complete and usable in a GIS. These\nadjustments include adding points locations for records in the accompanying\nSource pit data sheets where no point representation existed on the Source map\nsheets, adding attribution data to the furthest extent possible for points on\nthe Source map sheets without entries in the accompanying Source pit data\nsheets, appending a letter to the pit number of repeated (duplicate) pit\nnumbers to make them unique and correspond one-to-one with a record in the\nSource pit data sheets, and adding a '-999' to represent 'No data' or 'No\nobservation' for blank entries in the pit data sheets.  Table 3 in the\nOpen-File Report text describes the actions taken to insure data consistency\nand uniqueness of the individual points.  An accompanying ArcInfo arc coverage\ncalled marbase of the generalized Maricopa County boundary, and generalized\nmajor roadways and generalized major hydrography of Maricopa County has been\nincluded to give a general reference of pit location in proximity to natural\nand man-made features.",
