    "description": "Dave Gardner was on Heard Island in January and February 2000 as part of the 2000 ANARE.  Opportunistic use was made of the the differential gps system to take accurate locations of 16 points identified from the 1987 aerial photography, so that they could be used as reference points for merging the photographs into an accurate photo mosaic.\n\nAround the station and to the NE it was easy to identify features from the photographs with confidence.  To the west of the station the topography and features of the azorella wallows had changed significant and it was not possible to identify features with confidence.",
