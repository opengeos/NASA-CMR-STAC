    "description": "Taken from sections of the report:\n\nProject officers Samim Naebkhil and Michael Moore from Geodetic operations within Geoscience Australia Earth Monitoring Group took part in the 2004/2005 Summer Antarctic Geodesy Program.  Samim Naebkhil left Hobart aboard Aurora Australis on Voyage 1 on the 5th of October, 2004 to Casey.  Michael Moore left aboard V2 in November 2004.\n\nThe 2004/2005 season had a number of aims and objectives to be meet.\nThese included:\n- Reference Mark Survey of Australian Regional GPS network in Antarctica Casey AUS100, Davis AUS099 and Mawson AUS064.\n- Levelling from the GPS marks to the Tide Gauge Bench Marks\n- Upgrade of Australian Regional GPS network in Antarctica Casey AUS100, Davis AUS099, and Mawson AUS064.\n- Reference Mark Survey and Upgrade of Continuous GPS Sites (CGPS) AUS351 Grove Mountains, Wilson Bluff and Mt. Creswell.\n- Perform an ICESAT calibration at Mt. Creswell\n- GPS observation at Larseman Hills over Geodynamic mark AUS334 and Tide gauge Bench Mark NMVS278.\n- GPS observation over the Tide Gauge Bench Marks at Casey, Davis and Mawson.\n- Gravity observations at Casey, Davis and Mawson.\n- GPS observations over including the Chinese and Russian survey Marks to strength the Australian Geodetic Network and an establishment of a unified datum.\n- GPS observations over various Bench Marks in the Vestfolds hills to strengthen the geometric geoid.\n- Assist other science programs with Geodesy related support.\nDespite all efforts made to accomplish all the aimed tasks for this season, a number of these tasks could not be done and were beyond our control due to late arrival and associated problems with the CASA planes.\nThe following tasks were not able to be done this season:\n- Reference Mark Survey of Mawson ARGN AUS064.\n- Orthometric Leveling from Mawson ARGN AUS064 to Tide Gauge Bench Marks\n- Reference Mark Survey and upgrades of CGPS sites Wilson Bluff and Mt. Creswell\n- Perform an ICESAT calibration at Mt. Creswell\n- Gravity connection Mawson.\n\nThis work contributed towards AAS (ASAC) project 1159.",
