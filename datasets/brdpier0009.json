    "description": "The feral house cat (Felis catus), Hawaiian Short-eared Owl or Pueo (Asio\nflammeus sandwichensis), and Common Barn Owl (Tyto alba) are important\npredators of birds and introduced rodents in Hawai'i.  Cat scats from the\nisland of Hawai'i (n=87), Pueo pellets from Hawai'i, Kaua'i, and Kaho'olawe\n(n=36), and Barn Owl pellets from Hawai'i, O'ahu and Kaho'olawe (n=301) were\nexamined to determine the incidence of rodent, bird and insect remains in the\ndiets of these predators. Rodents were the main prey of cats, Pueo, and Barn\nOwls, but the incidence of bird remains in diets of all three predator species\nwas high relative to studies conducted elsewhere in the world.\n\n   Geographic Description:\n   All cat scats were collected in dry mamane (Sophora chrysophylla)-naio\n(Myoporum sandwichensis) forests on the western and eastern slopes of Mauna Kea\nabove 2,000 m elevation.  Pueo pellets were collected in dry forests on Mauna\nKea (n=13), from Kaumana Gulch on Kaho'olawe (n=21), and from the Alakai Swamp\non Kaua'i (n=2).  Barn Owl pellets were collected at roosts and nests at\nKakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge on Hawai'i (n=207), near the Pu'u La'au\ncabin on Mauna Kea (n= 73), on O'ahu (n=19), at Ahupi Beach on Kaho'olawe\n(n=1).  Acumulations of Barn Owl pellets were found below roosting sites,\nwhereas single Pueo pellets were found below tall trees or on open ground\n(Mauna Kea), or on cliff faces on Kaho'olawe.  On Kaua'i, Pueo pellets were\nfound in an open bog near the remains of a recent Pacific Golden Plover kill.\n1.5.2 Bounding Rectangle Coordinates\n\n   Methodology:\n   Determined predator diets from analysis of 87 cat scats, 36 Pueo pellets,\nand\n301 Barn Owl pellets.  All cat scats were collected in dry mamane-naio forests.\n Size, appearance, and consistency were used to determine the source of scats\nand pellets.  Cat scats were smaller than pellets and had tapered ends with\nfewer bones distributed through them.  Pueo pellets were smaller than Barn Owl\npellets and had a uniformly cylindrical shape.  They fit Mikkola's (1983)\ndescription as \"elongated, roughly cylindrical dark gray and formed from a\ntightly-massed conglomeration of fur or feathers with a central core of mammal\nand bird bones.\"",
