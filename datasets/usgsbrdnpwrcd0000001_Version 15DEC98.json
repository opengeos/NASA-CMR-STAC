    "description": "The invasion of exotic plants is becoming a problem in many ecosystems\nincluding some areas in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) (Rocky Mountain\nNational Park Resource Management Reports #1 and #13). Some exotic species,\nsuch as leafy spurge and spotted knapweed, are capable of rapidly colonizing\nareas, altering community composition, and even displacing native species\n(Belcher and Wilson 1989, Tyser and Key 1988). In many cases, the processes of\ninvasion are poorly documented, and little information is available on an\narea's past history. However, there is a large amount of information available\nin the literature which relates to the life history traits of exotic species\nand the  distribution of exotic species. This information can be used to help\npredict the potential distribution and threat of exotic species to ecosystems. \n Exotic plants can be thought of as those plants which did not originally occur\nin the ecosystem, and have since been introduced to the area. The National Park\nService (NPS) defines an exotic species as, \"those that occur in a given place\nas a result of direct or indirect, deliberate, or accidental actions by\nhumans.\" This somewhat conservative definition of exotic species is necessary\nto insure that natural resources in national parks are preserved.   NPS policy\ngenerally prohibits the introduction of exotic species into natural areas of\nnational parks. Exotic species which threaten park resources or public health\nare to be managed or eliminated if possible. In addition, the NPS recently\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with 10 other federal and state agencies\nin the state of Colorado. This agreement states that all paid management\nagencies will work with private and county entities to manage exotic plants\nand, in particular, \"noxious weeds.\" RMNP is currently working with Estes Park\nin exotic plant control as part of this agreement.",
