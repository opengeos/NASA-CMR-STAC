    "description": "Seismic data collected with broadband seismometers at rock outcrops as part of AAS 4318. Seven new sites were established (sites BHIL, CAD1, CAD2, CAD3, CAD4, CAD5 and CAD6) and measurements at a previously established site (DAVI) was recommenced. The sites were deployed continuously, although measurements were intermittent based on power restrictions and hardware performance issues.\n\nApproximate site locations are given below in units of decimal degrees (WGS84) as (latitude longitude) pairs:\nCAD1 approx coordinates only - Carey Ntk - as no data yet downloaded\nCAD2 -68.566510 86.100627 Mt Brown, new site established under this project\nCAD3 -66.521103 96.363667 Gillies Island, new site established under this project\nCAD4 -67.419656 99.143785 Mt Strathcona, new site established under this project\nCAD5 -66.552475 107.764024 Snyder Rocks, new site established under this project\nCAD6 -66.789282 120.990964 Chick Island, new site established under this project\nBHIL -66.251024 100.599006 Bunger Hills site, new site established under this project\n\nSite changes\n============\nInstruments were deployed continuously but did not operate continuously due to solar powering of the instruments with a small battery array.\n\nDue to instrument failures, the recorders at CAD5 and BHIL were doubled in some periods. The recorder at DAVI was also doubled. \n\nData sets:\n=========\n\nSeismic data is stored in miniSEED format, one stream for each channel. One file for each day with data recorded. If the recording is interrupted, additional files are generated for that day. \n\nThe file name contains station name and starting time information, e.g. \n\nCAD3_2016_12_09T19_10_06_840000Z.BHE\n\nSSSS_YYYY_MM_DDTHH_mm_ss_mmmmmmZ.BHC\n\nWhere S is a four-letter station name\nYYYY is year\nMM is month\nDD is the day (in the month)\nHH is the hour (0-24)\nmm is minute\nss is second\nmmmmmm is milliseconds, padded with 0\u2019s\nC (last in file extension) is the orientation of the channel. \n           N = North-South\n           E \u2013 East-West\n           Z \u2013 Up-Down\n\nMiniSEED is the subset of the SEED standard that is used for time series data. Very limited metadata for the time series is included in miniSEED beyond time series identification and simple state-of-health flags. In particular, geographic coordinates, response/scaling information and other information needed to interpret the data values are not included.\nTime series are stored as generally independent, fixed-length data records which each contain a small segment of contiguous series values.",
