    "description": "Mitigation is superior to post-disaster response in reducing the billions of\ndollars in losses resulting from U.S. natural disasters, and information that\npredicts the varying likelihood of geologic hazards can help public agencies\nimproves the necessary decision making on land use and zoning. Accordingly,\nthis map was created to increase the resistance of one urban area, metropolitan\nOakland, California, to land sliding.  Prepared in a geographic information\nsystem from a statistical model, the map estimates the relative likelihood of\nlocal slopes to fail by two processes common to this area of diverse geology,\nterrain, and land use.\n\nMap data that predict the varying likelihood of land sliding can help public\nagencies make informed decisions on land use and zoning.  This map, prepared in\na geographic information system from a statistical model, estimates the\nrelative likelihood of local slopes to fail by two processes common to an area\nof diverse geology, terrain, and land use centered on metropolitan Oakland. \nThe model combines the following spatial data: (1) 120 bedrock and surficial\ngeologic-map units, (2) ground slope calculated from a 30-m digital elevation\nmodel, (3) an inventory of 6,714 old landslide deposits (not distinguished by\nage or type of movement and excluding debris flows), and (4) the locations of\n1,192 post-1970 landslides that damaged the built environment. The resulting\nindex of likelihood, or susceptibility, plotted as a 1:50,000-scale map, is\ncomputed as a continuous variable over a large area (872 km2) at a\ncomparatively fine (30 m) resolution. This new model complements landslide\ninventories by estimating susceptibility between existing landslide deposits,\nand improves upon prior susceptibility maps by quantifying the degree of\nsusceptibility within those deposits.\n\nSusceptibility is defined for each geologic-map unit as the spatial frequency\n(areal percentage) of terrain occupied by old landslide deposits, adjusted\nlocally by steepness of the topography.  Susceptibility of terrain between the\nold landslide deposits is read directly from a slope histogram for each\ngeologic-map unit, as the percentage (0.00 to 0.90) of 30-m cells in each\none-degree slope interval that coincides with the deposits.\n\nSusceptibility within landslide deposits (0.00 to 1.33) is this same percentage\nraised by a multiplier (1.33) derived from the comparative frequency of recent\nfailures within and outside the old deposits.  Positive results from two\nevaluations of the model encourage its extension to the 10-county San Francisco\nBay region and elsewhere.  A similar map could be prepared for any area where\nthe three basic constituents, a geologic map, a landslide inventory, and a\nslope map, are available in digital form.  Added predictive power of the new\nsusceptibility model may reside in attributes that remain to be explored-among\nthem seismic shaking, distance to nearest road, and terrain elevation, aspect,\nrelief, and curvature.",
