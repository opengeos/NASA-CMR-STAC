    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data sets that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.\n\nThis data set consists of digital polygons of a constant recharge value for the\nalluvial and terrace deposits along the Beaver-North Canadian River from the\npanhandle to Canton Lake in northwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in 830 square\nmiles of the Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace aquifer is an important source\nof water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies.\nThe aquifer consists of poorly sorted, fine to coarse, unconsolidated quartz\nsand with minor amounts of clay, silt, and basal gravel. The hydraulically\nconnected alluvial and terrace deposits unconformably overlie the Tertiary-age\nOgallala Formation and Permian-age formations.\n\nA recharge rate of 1 inch per year was estimated in the ground-water modeling\nreport for the alluvial and terrace deposits and used in this data set. The\nrecharge rate was estimated using a base-flow method and a\nmonthly-water-balance method.\n\nThe features in the data set representing boundaries along geological contacts\nwere extracted from a published digital surficial geology data set based on a\nscale of 1:250,000. The geographic limits of the aquifer were digitized from a\nfolded paper map, at a scale of 1:250,000 in the ground-water modeling report.\n\nGround-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and\naggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of\naquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of\nrecharge used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but\nare within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",
