    "description": "We recorded snow ablation maps with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS, Riegl-VZ6000) at the Gletschboden area. The TLS position is located approximately 30 vertical meters above the Gletschboden area at a northerly exposed slope. In total 44 TLS measurement sets have been conducted in three consecutive years 2014-2016 (2014: 13 measurements; 2015: 17 measurements; 2016: 14 measurements). The TLS system has a single-point measurement frequency of 300 kHz and a beam divergence of 0.007\u00b0. This set-up allows a horizontal resolution of approximately 0.01 m in 100 m distance to the TLS position. One scan of the Gletschboden area lasts approximately 15 minutes. The travel time from the laser scanner towards the surface is recorded and afterwards converted into a point cloud of distances. 5 reflectors located at the Gletschboden area and in the closer surroundings were additionally scanned during each measurement to transform the point cloud from the scanner own coordinate system into Swiss coordinates. Additionally, orthophotos have been created by using pictures recorded from the TLS in order to provide snow mask maps. Snow and bare ground can be distinguished by the RGB color information of the orthophoto. Cells with blue band information greater than 175 were categorized as snow and all cells with values smaller or equal 175 were categorized as bare ground.",
