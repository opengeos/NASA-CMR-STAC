    "description": "GVHRRATS6IMIR is the Geosynchronous Very High Resolution Radiometer (GVHRR) Black and White Infrared Images on 70mm Film data product from the sixth Applications Technology Satellite (ATS-6). This set of IR imagery (10.5 to 12.5 micrometer, with an 11 km footprint at the sub-satellite point) was originally produced on commercial image-generation equipment from digital tapes and was made available on 70-mm film, from which they were later scanned to digital TIFF image files. Each TIFF scan contains 2 or 3 pictures, and there are several hundred scans from an original 70 mm film roll which are combined into a ZIP file. Each picture contains a title at the bottom of the image and a gray scale on the right boundary that represents brightness temperatures. The title contains the satellite identification, receiving station, spectral band, picture number, picture type, pixel scale, sector number, and date.\n\nThe ATS-6 satellite was in a geosynchronous orbit parked at 95W viewing the hemisphere below the satellite. The GVHRR experiment returned data from launch until August 15, 1974 when it became inoperable, The PI was William E. Shenk from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nThis product was previously available from the NSSDC with the identifier ESAD-00092 (old ID 74-039A-08B).",
