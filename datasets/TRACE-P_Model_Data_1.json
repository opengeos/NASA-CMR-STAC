    "description": "TRACE-P_Model_Data is the model data collected during the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) suborbital campaign. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe NASA TRACE-P mission was a part of NASA\u2019s Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) \u2013 an assemblage of missions conducted from 1983-2001 with various research goals and objectives.\u202fTRACE-P was a multi-organizational campaign with NASA, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and several US universities.\u202fTRACE-P deployed\u202fits payloads in the Pacific between the months of March and April 2001 with the goal of studying the air chemistry emerging\u202ffrom Asia\u202fto the western Pacific.\u202fAlong with this, TRACE-P had the objective\u202fstudying\u202fthe chemical evolution of the air as it moved away from Asia.\u202f \r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish its goals, the NASA DC-8 aircraft and NASA P-3B aircraft were deployed, each equipped with various instrumentation.\u202fTRACE-P also relied on ground sites,\u202fand\u202fsatellites\u202fto collect data. The DC-8 aircraft was equipped with 19 instruments in total\u202fwhile the P-3B\u202fboasted\u202f21 total instruments.\u202fSome instruments on the DC-8 include the Nephelometer, the GCMS, the Nitric Oxide Chemiluminescence, the Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL), and the Dual Channel Collectors and Fluorometers, HPLC. The Nephelometer was utilized to gather data on various\u202fwavelengths\u202fincluding\u202faerosol\u202fscattering\u202f(450, 550, 700nm), aerosol absorption (565nm), equivalent BC mass, and air density ratio. The GCMS was responsible for capturing a multitude of compounds in the atmosphere, some of which include CH4, CH3CHO, CH3Br, CH3Cl, CHBr3, and C2H6O.\u202fDIAL was used for a variety of measurements, some of which include aerosol wavelength dependence (1064/587nm), IR aerosol scattering ratio (1064nm),\u202ftropopause heights and ozone columns, visible aerosol scattering ratio, composite tropospheric ozone cross-sections, and visible aerosol depolarization. Finally, the Dual Channel Collectors and Fluorometers, HPLC collected data on H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O in the atmosphere.\u202fThe P-3B aircraft was equipped with various instruments for TRACE-P, some of which include\u202fthe MSA/CIMS, the Non-dispersive IR Spectrometer, the PILS-Ion Chromatograph, and the\u202fCondensation particle counter and Pulse Height Analysis (PHA). The\u202fMSA/CIMS measured OH, H2SO4, MSA, and HNO3. The Non-dispersive IR Spectrometer took measurements on CO2 in the atmosphere. The PILS-Ion Chromatograph recorded measurements of compounds and elements in the atmosphere, including sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, NH4, NO3, and SO4. Finally, the Condensation particle counter and PHA was used to gather data on total UCN, UCN 3-8nm, and UCN 3-4nm. Along with the aircrafts, ground stations measured air quality from China along with C2H2, C2H6, CO, and HCN.\u202fFinally, satellites imagery was used to collect a multitude of data, some of the uses were to observe the history of lightning flashes,\u202fSeaWiFS\u202fcloud imagery, 8-day exposure to TOMS aerosols, and\u202fSeaWiFS\u202faerosol optical thickness. The imagery was used to best aid in planning for the aircraft deployment.\u202f\u202f ",
