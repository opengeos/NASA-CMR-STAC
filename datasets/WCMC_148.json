    "description": "WCMC has recently completed a digital database containing maps and\n      statistical data for the world's protected areas system. Data have\n      been published in a four-volume Directory of the National Parks and\n      Protected Areas of the World. The Centre is also responsible for\n      producing the United Nations List of National Parks and Protected\n      Areas. In addition, the Centre has mapped on the GIS all those Forest\n      Reserves that are managed for environmental or conservation purposes.\n      The results are being used by FAO as a contribution to the Forest\n      Resources Assessment 1990 Project. The overall database now includes\n      data and location maps for some 40,000 protected areas, held on a\n      FoxPro (IBM compatible) database.\n      \n      \n      WCMC Protected Areas Database\n      \n      The database was developed in collaboration with protected areas professionals\n      around the world over a period of more than 10 years. Through collaboration\n      with IUCN, The World Conservation Union, the Ramsar Convention Bureau and\n      UNESCO, WCMC has particularly comprehensive information on natural sites listed\n      under the World Heritage Convention, Biosphere Reserves, and wetlands of\n      international importance listed under the Ramsar sites. WCMC also has\n      information relating to regional protected areas agreements and conventions.\n      The WCMC Protected Areas Database holds data on over 40,000 sites\n      around the world designated for nature conservation purposes, together\n      with details of sites designated under international conventions and\n      programmes. There are, for example, about 1000 sites covered by the\n      Ramsar and World Heritage Conventions, and the UNESCO-MAB Biosphere\n      Reserves Programme.\n      \n      LANGUAGE:\n        English\n      \n      ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION:\n      \n      WCMC makes information available through published media, through provision\n      of datasets, and through the provision of either standard or customised reports.\n      WCMC is committed to the principle of the free exchange of data with other\n      institutions and users. In so far as is practical, it places its data in the\n      public domain and encourages their wide distribution. However, costs may be\n      incurred in accessing and distributing datasets, and where analysis and\n      assessment provide an added-value service. Such costs are passed on to the\n      user.\n      \n      External Access -\n      \n      For a number of years, WCMC collaborated with the US National Park\n      Service to test direct access to WCMC's database on protected areas.\n      It is intended to resume this shortly as a test of the new system, and\n      then to extend the service to others. The best means of implementing\n      this are still being investigated, but are likely to be one or more of\n      the following:\n      \n            * Direct access through a modem link\n            * Provision of copies of the database on diskette/tape\n            * Provision of copies of the database on CDRom\n            * Transfer of the database using anonymous ftp\n      \n      Software Requirements-\n      \n      FoxPro 2.0 is used as the database management system. The system will\n      run on a run-time version of FoxPro which enables the viewing, adding,\n      editing and reporting of data. Creation of custom reports requires the\n      development version of FoxPro.\n      \n      Basic mapping software (WCMC mapit) is included with the database\n      programmes, but users require access to a full copy of Atlas*GIS to\n      make use of the integrated GIS links.\n      \n      Access to Wordperfect site and country sheets requires the user to\n      have access to a copy of Wordperfect 5.0 or greater.\n      \n      Hardware Requirements -\n      \n      The minimum hardware requirements to run the WCMC Protected Areas\n      Database are an IBM 386 with a minimum of 2 Mbyte of memory, and DOS\n      5.0 or above with DOS loaded high to give a minimum of 590K free\n      conventional memory. The diskspace occupied by the system is as\n      follows:\n             * 60 Mbytes main data base and executables\n             * 60 Mbytes WordPerfect Site and Country Sheets (optional)",
