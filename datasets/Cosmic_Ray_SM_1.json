    "description": "Data have been collected from muon detectors in cosmic ray observatories/laboratories at Macquarie Island, Wilkes, Casey and Mawson.  Data have been collected from varied detectors and detecting systems, specific operational times and detector information are available on request.\n  \nThis dataset contains normalised counting rate records from the combined north/south pointing proportional counter telescopes P2 and P3 in low and high zenith angle modes, corrected for atmospheric pressure variation.  No correction has been made for height or temperature of the 125mb level resulting in a significant seasonal variation but no diurnal variation at Antarctic latitudes.\n\nThe telescope output consists of the sum of the 2-fold coincidence counting rates.  Coincidence counts from individual counter pairs are summed into thirteen possible arrival zenith angles and two arrival directions (north or south).  The low zenith data are hourly sums of coincidences from the seven lowest zenith angles of arrival (34 degrees -51 degrees) and the high zenith data are hourly sums of coincidences of the remaining six zenith angles of arrival (55 degrees -79 degrees).\n\nThe accidental rate is removed from the total coincidence rate using a resolving time difference method (See  Jacklyn R M and Duldig M L, 20th Int. Cosmic Ray Conf. Papers, Moscow,  Vol 4, pp. 380-383, 1987).\n\nFurther information is also provided in ANARE Research Notes 102, 50 Years of cosmic ray research in Tasmania.
