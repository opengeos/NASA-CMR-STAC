    "description": "The AQUALOOKS project aimed to improve remote sensing observations of coastal and inland waters thanks to multi-look observations. Today, correcting remote sensing observations for air-water interface BRDF (i.e. skyglint and sunglint) or water BRDF is still challenging in turbid waters. This results in an increased uncertainty in final products. To improve BRDF knowledge and BRDF correction algorithms, AQUALOOKS project focused on multi-look observations. Multi-look observations were achieved in water, above water surface and at top of the atmosphere. Multi-look in water measurements were performed during a 3-weeks fieldwork experiment in Belgium. Multi-look above water measurements were performed with the PANTHYR-2 autonomous hyperspectral system at RT 1 station and multi-look top of atmosphere measurements were achieved by satellite sensors CHRIS-PROBA and Pleiades A/B, after acquisition requests. Multi-views observation data were used in addition with a radiative transfer model to better characterize BRDF and to develop correction algorithms.",
