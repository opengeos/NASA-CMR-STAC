    "description": "Skuas as a group have come to be recognized as 'barometers' of environmental health, as their wide range and feeding habits make them ideal for monitoring oceanic pollution. Skua and adelie penguin carcasses and abandoned eggs of both species were collected from rookeries on Ross Island (Cape Bird, Cape Evans, Cape Royds, Cape Crozier and around the science bases Scott Base and McMurdo). The carcasses and eggs were analysed for residues of organochlorine pesticides, PCB's and heavy metals to assess whether pollutant loads are high enough to adversely affect the reproductive success of either bird species. Residues were measured in the liver and breast muscle tissue of carcasses and the lipids of the egg yolks. The effects of organochlorines on both skuas and penguins was also evaluated through measurements of mixed function oxidase activitiy in liver samples. The residue level can also act as a benchmark with which to compare pollutant levels in Antarctic wildlife in the future.",
