    "description": "This dataset contains georeferenced InSAR-derived water level change maps for Delta-X flight lines acquired during the spring (2021-03-27 to 2021-04-18) and fall (2021-09-03 to 2021-09-13) deployments. Water-level change observations are provided throughout wetlands of the Atchafalaya and Terrebonne Basins, in Southern Louisiana, USA, within the Mississippi River Delta (MRD). The data were collected by Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), a polarimetric L-band synthetic aperture radar flown on the NASA Gulfstream-III (C20) aircraft as part of the Delta-X campaign. Water surface elevations were measured on multiple flights at 30-minute intervals. There are three types of gridded products available: temporalcoherence (which provide an index measuring quality of phase unwrapping ranging from 0 (poor) to 1 (correctly unwrapped)), waterlevelchange in centimeters (which provide cumulative changes in water levels at approximately 30-minute intervals), and waterlevelchange_ramp in centimeters (which provide a 2-dimensional linear trend in water-level estimates not related to changing water levels). The water-level change maps were estimated using the phase unwrapping corrected interferograms generated for nearest-neighbor (NN), NN+1, and NN+2 pairs for data acquired within a single flight (one day). This analysis was done for all flight lines. Water level changes are relative to the first sampling flight for that study area. Data quality was assessed by comparing water elevation estimates with data from in situ water level gauges throughout the study area. A series of quality assurance masks of troposphere-induced phase delay regions were generated for all SAR acquisition dates using a weather feature matching algorithm.",
