    "description": "This map forms part of the Montana State Geological Map.\n\nThe Ennis 1:100,000 quadrangle lies within both the Laramide (Late Cretaceous\nto early Tertiary) foreland province of southwestern Montana and the\nnortheastern margin of the middle to late Tertiary Basin and Range province.\n\nThe oldest rocks in the quadrangle are Archean high-grade gneiss, and granitic\nto ultramafic intrusive rocks that are as old as about 3.0 Ga. The gneiss\nincludes a supracrustal assemblage of quartz-feldspar gneiss, amphibolite,\nquartzite, and biotite schist and gneiss. The basement rocks are overlain by a\nplatform sequence of sedimentary rocks as old as Cambrian Flathead Quartzite\nand as young as Upper Cretaceous Livingston Group sandstones, shales, and\nvolcanic rocks.\n\nThe Archean crystalline rocks crop out in the cores of large basement uplifts,\nmost notably the \"Madison-Gravelly arch\" that includes parts of the present\nTobacco Root Mountains and the Gravelly, Madison, and Gallatin Ranges. These\nbasement uplifts or blocks were thrust westward during the Laramide orogeny\nover rocks as young as Upper Cretaceous. The thrusts are now exposed in the\nquadrangle along the western flanks of the Gravelly and Madison Ranges (the\nGreenhorn thrust and the Hilgard fault system, respectively). Simultaneous with\nthe west-directed thrusting, northwest-striking, northeast-side-up reverse\nfaults formed a parallel set across southwestern Montana; the largest of these\nis the Spanish Peaks fault, which cuts prominently across the Ennis quadrangle.\n\nBeginning in late Eocene time, extensive volcanism of the Absorka Volcanic\nSupergroup covered large parts of the area; large remnants of the volcanic\nfield remain in the eastern part of the quadrangle.  The volcanism was\nconcurrent with, and followed by, middle Tertiary extension. During this time,\nthe axial zone of the \"Madison-Gravelly arch,\" a large Laramide uplift,\ncollapsed, forming the Madison Valley, structurally a complex down-to-the-east\nhalf graben. Basin deposits as thick as 4,500 m filled the graben.\n\nPleistocene glaciers sculpted the high peaks of the mountain ranges and formed\nthe present rugged topography.\n\nCompilation scale is 1:100,000.  Geology mapped between 1988 and 1995.\nCompilation completed 1997.\nReview and revision completed 1997.\nArchive files prepared 1998-02.",
