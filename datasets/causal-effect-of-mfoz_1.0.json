    "description": "Title: Closer to causality: How effective is spatial planning in governing built-up land expansion in Fujian Province, China?    Research objective: The Major Function Oriented Zone (MFOZ), the first strategic spatial plan in China, is developed to achieve a coordinated regional development, through spatial regulation and zoning of development. The MFOZ he MFOZ divided land into four major function-oriented zones: The development-optimized zone, the development-prioritised zone, the development-restricted zone, and the development-prohibited zone. We used propensity score marching to evaluate the effect of the MFOZ on built-up land expansion in Fujian Province over three time intervals (2013\u20132015, 2013\u20132018 and 2013\u20132020).     Data: Data.xlsx contains the variables of 954 towns in Fujian Province.   Town_ID is the town unique ID;   County_ID is the county unique ID;  City_ID is the city unique ID;  MFOZ is the the development-prioritised zone and the development-restricted zone (The development-optimized zone and the development-prohibited zone are excluded);  Builtup_13_15 is the built-up land expansion from 2013 to 2015;   Builtup_13_18 is the built-up land expansion from 2013 to 2018;  Builtup_13_20 is the built-up land expansion from 2013 to 2020;  Dis2water is the Euclidean distance from the town to the nearest waterbody;  Slope is the the average slope within the town;  GDP is the average GDP in 2010 within the town;   Pop is the average population in 2010 within the town;  Road is the average population in 2010 within the town;  Dis2city is the Euclidean distance from the town to the nearest prefectural city centre;  Nei_Arable, Nei_Forest, and Nei_Built.up are the area of arable land, forest land, and built-up land neighbouring town i in 2010.    Method: we used the propensity score matching to compare the changes in the amount of built-up land in the towns of the development-prioritised zone with the matched towns of the development-restricted zone. Additionally, we used three evaluation intervals (2013\u20132015, 2013\u20132018 and 2013\u20132020) to evaluate temporal variation in the causal effect of the MFOZ on built-up land expansion.",
