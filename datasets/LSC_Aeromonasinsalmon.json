    "description": "During the early 1900s, several researchers cultured Aeromonas salmonicida,\ncause of furunculosis disease, from the kidneys and intestines of apparently\nhealthy trout. Home (1928) speculated that asymptomatic carriers become\nreservoirs of infection. Hence, a need was perceived for bacteriological\nexaminations to be conducted even before asymptoimatic fish were stocked.\nDuring the devastating outbreaks of furunculosis that occurred in Great Britain\nin the 1920-30s, Mackie et al. (1933) noted that epizootics in natural waters\ncorrelated with the stocking of fish originating from infected farms. They also\nnoted that the kidney was the usual site of harborage of the pathogen but\nculture often provided inadequate detection. More recent studies continue to\nemphasize the importance of asymptomatic, carrier fish as reservoirs of\ninfection and spread of the disease within the natural environment (Jarp et al.\n1993, Johnsen and Jensen 1994).",
