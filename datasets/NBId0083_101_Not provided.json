This was in response to the request to GRID by the Kenya\nMinistry of Agriculture to assist in creating the datasets.\n\nThe source information and scales are varied; Rivers, Agroecological\nZones, Soils, Boundaries, Towns, Lakes, Transport, and the Districts,\nProvinces (administrative boundary), Elevation were based on the scale\nof 1: 1 000 000 and of which the source information was derived from\nMinistry of Agriculture and Survey of Kenya maps. The Landuse dataset\nwas based on the Kenya Rangeland Ecological Monitoring Unit (KREMU now\nDRSRS) map at the scale of 1: 1 000 000.The Mean Annual Rainfall\ndataset was based on an East Africa map(1966) at the scale of 1: 2 000\n000\n\nRainfall data was originally provided by Kenya Meteorological\nDepartment. These were collected from a total of 79 Stations for the\nperiod between 1982-1988.  More records were added by GRID which\nextended the period to 1991 The data consists of the\nrainfall,Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) and Temperature\ninformation.\n\nSample\nFiles:\nRAINFALL.E00\nFILL8291.PLU, PETALL.DBF/.NDX, ADD82,83,84,85,86.DAT\n(Others available on request)\n\nVector Members:\n- Files are in an  ArcInfo Export format",
