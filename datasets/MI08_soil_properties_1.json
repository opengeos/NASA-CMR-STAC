    "description": "Samples were collected on Macquarie Island from three sites: the main powerhouse, the fuel farm and a reference site on the isthmus by the Bioremediation Project team in January 2008. Soil characteristics including conductivity, pH, total petroleum hydrocarbons, total carbon, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, fluoride, bromide, chloride, sulphate and phosphate were measured.\n\nThe data consists of two files, the rtf file contains the methods used and the csv file contains the soil characteristics. Samples are identified by a barcode which is the barcode number assigned by the Bioremediation Project Sample Tracking Database.\n\nThis work was carried out as part of AAS project 1163.",
