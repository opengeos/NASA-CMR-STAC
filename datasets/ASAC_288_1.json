    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 288 See the link below for public details on this project.\n\nFrom the abstract of the referenced paper:\n      \nIn January-February 1991, in Prydz Bay, phytoplankton bloom was evident in the inner shelf area with the dominant diatoms being represented mainly by pennate species of the Nitzschia-Fragilariopsis group.  Dinoflagellates and naked flagellates were most abundant in the centre of the bay; however, larger heterotrophic species prevailed at the southern stations.  Cell carbon values (average 317 micro grams per litre; range 92-1048 micrograms per litre) found in the bloom in the south were chiefly due to pennate diatoms and larger heterotrophic dinoflagellates.  Much lower carbon values (average 51 micro grams per litre; range 7-147 micro grams per litre) in the outer shelf region were mainliy contributed by large centric diatoms (70-110 micro metres) and small dinoflagellates (5-25 micro metres).  Wide ranges of algal cell sizes were observed in both southern and northern communities; the overlapping of sizes of diatoms and flagellates, the latter containing heterotrophs, suggested complex trophic relationships within the plankton and an enhanced heterotrophic activity in the south.  North-to-south variations in surface delta 13 C of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), (range -31.85 to -20.12 parts per thousand) were directly related to the concentration of particulate matter: this suggested the effect of biomass, and thus of dissolved CO2 limitation on carbon fractionation.  Three types of species assemblages were distinguished, corresponding to different narrow ranges of delta 13 C values (-20.12 to -22.37 parts per thousand; -24.50 to -26.65 parts per thousand; -29.73 to -31.85 parts per thousand); dominant species within each assemblage are the likely major determinants of the carbon isotopic composition and variation of SPOM. Pennate diatoms, such as Nitzschia curta and N. subcurvata appear to have made the major imprint on the highest delta 13 C values.  Phaeocystis, naked flagellates, autotrophic dinoflagellates and centric diatoms are likely to have caused the lower delta 13 C values of SPOM.  It appears that variations in both biomass concentration and in phytoplankton species composition have contributed to the carbon isotopic values of SPOM in Prydz Bay.",
