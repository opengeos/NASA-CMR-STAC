    "description": "Korean Antarctic survey carried out as part of step 3 project in year 4 of \u2018The Antarctic Undersea Geological Survey\u2019 was conducted in the Powell Basin (IV region) of the northern Weddell Sea, Antarctica.\nBecause Korea doesn't have an icebreaker for Antarctic research, during the Antarctic site survey period, research ships are secured and conducted through a chartering. The available chartering are limited. It's because the duration of the chartering is concentrated in the summer season like any other country. We took on lease Russian R/V \"Yuzhmorgeologiya\" (5500 ton, ice strengthed vessel) used on lease by NOAA in the United States as in other years. It was used from November to December, just before the NOAA use period.\nThe research period was from 24 Nov. to 9 Dec. (8 days) in 2003. After geophysical research including acquisition of multichannel seismic data, a drilling investigation was conducted in coring point was decided from combined geophysical data. 12 researchers from KOPRI, Seoul University etc. participated in the cruise as field investigation personnel.",
