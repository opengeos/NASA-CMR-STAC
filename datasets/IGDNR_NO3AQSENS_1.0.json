    "description": "This data set was designed for statewide evaluation of\n      agrichemical leaching characteristics and associated\n      aquifer sensitivity to contamination.  It was created to\n      classify soils and aquifer settings according to predictions\n      of leaching potential.  The classifications have not been\n      validated by the results of water quality sampling and\n      accordingly, the reliability of these aquifer sensitivity\n      ratings as predictors of water quality has not been evaluated.\n      \n      \n      This is a statewide Arc/Info data set for evaluating the potential\n      for contamination of shallow aquifers by nitrate.  The sources of\n      this data set were published and digitized at 1:250,000; however,\n      the soils map and depth to aquifer map (stack-unit map) were\n      generated from source data mapped at 1:15,000 and 1:64,000,\n      respectively.  This aquifer sensitivity map was published at\n      1:500,000.  Nominal scale is 1:250,000.\n      \n      Two statewide data sets were identified as containing\n      information that would be useful for producing aquifer\n      sensitivity maps:  a soil association map (and database)\n      and a map of geologic materials to a depth of 50 feet\n      (Stack-unit map).  The soil association map and database\n      were used in an interpretive mapping model that generated\n      a map of nitrate leaching classes by examining factors that\n      relate to water movement characteristics of the soil.\n      \n      The Stack-Unit map was used to create a map of depth to the\n      uppermost aquifer, which was then combined with the map of\n      nitrate leaching classes.  This combined map was interpreted\n      based on the sensitivity of aquifers (to create a map of\n      aquifer sensitivity) to contamination by nitrate leaching.\n      Six aquifer sensitivity classes are indicated: Excessive, High,\n      Moderate, Somewhat limited, Limited, and Very limited.\n      \n      Disturbed land and surface water areas are also shown.\n      \n      These data are to be used in conjunction with ISGS Environmental\n      Geology report 148. This data set is one of a suite of six\n      related data sets (listed below).  Full citation details are\n      available in the Cross References section.\n      \n      Aquifer Sensitivity to Contamination by Nitrate Leaching in Illinois\n      Nitrate Leaching Classes of Illinois Soils (this data set)\n      Nitrate Leaching Class Ranges\n      \n      Aquifer Sensitivity to Contamination by Pesticide Leaching in Illinois\n      Pesticide Leaching Classes of Illinois Soils\n      Pesticide Leaching Class Ranges\n      \n      This coverage includes county lines.  These lines are not directly\n      relevant to the data, but are necessary for technical reasons.\n      Without the additional county lines, some of the polygons exceed\n      the maximum allowable vertex limit in ARCPLOT.  This problem is\n      solved by the additional county lines, which serve to divide polygons\n      with too many vertices into smaller units.  Accordingly, to remove\n      the county lines from maps created with ARCPLOT, the DROPLINE\n      command must be used on conjunction with the COUNTY_NAME\n      polygon item.",
