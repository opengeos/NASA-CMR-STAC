    "description": "The PlanetScope Level 1B Basic Scene and Level 3B Ortho Scene full archive products are available as part of Planet imagery offer.\r\rThe Unrectified Asset: PlanetScope Basic Analytic Radiance (TOAR) product is a Scaled Top of Atmosphere Radiance (at sensor) and sensor corrected product, without correction for any geometric distortions inherent in the imaging processes and is not mapped to a cartographic projection. The imagery data is accompanied by Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) to enable orthorectification by the user.\rThis kind of product is designed for users with advanced image processing and geometric correction capabilities.\r\rBasic Scene Product Components and Format\rProduct Components\t\rImage File (GeoTIFF format)\rMetadata File (XML format)\rRational Polynomial Coefficients (XML format)\rThumbnail File (GeoTIFF format)\rUnusable Data Mask UDM File (GeoTIFF format)\rUsable Data Mask UDM2 File (GeoTIFF format)\rBands\t4-band multispectral image (blue, green, red, near-infrared) or 8-band (coastal-blue, blue, green I, green, yellow, red, Rededge, near-infrared)\rGround Sampling Distance\tApproximate, satellite altitude dependent\rDove-C: 3.0 m-4.1 m\rDove-R: 3.0 m-4.1 m\rSuperDove: 3.7 m-4.2 m\rAccuracy\t&lt;10 m RMSE\r \r\rThe Rectified assets: The PlanetScope Ortho Scene product is radiometrically-, sensor- and geometrically- corrected and is projected to a UTM/WGS84 cartographic map projection. The geometric correction uses fine Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with a post spacing of between 30 and 90 metres.\rOrtho Scene Product Components and Format\rProduct Components\t\rImage File (GeoTIFF format)\rMetadata File (XML format)\rThumbnail File (GeoTIFF format)\rUnusable Data Mask UDM File (GeoTIFF format)\rUsable Data Mask UDM2 File (GeoTIFF format)\rBands\t3-band natural colour (red, green, blue) or 4-band multispectral image (blue, green, red, near-infrared) or 8-band (coastal-blue, blue, green I, green, yellow, red, RedEdge, near-infrared)\rGround Sampling Distance\tApproximate, satellite altitude dependent\rDove-C: 3.0 m-4.1 m\rDove-R: 3.0 m-4.1 m\rSuperDove: 3.7 m-4.2 m\rProjection\tUTM WGS84\rAccuracy\t&lt;10 m RMSE\r \r\rPlanetScope Ortho Scene product is available in the following: \r\rPlanetScope Visual Ortho Scene product is orthorectified and colour-corrected (using a colour curve) 3-band RGB Imagery. This correction attempts to optimise colours as seen by the human eye providing images as they would look if viewed from the perspective of the satellite.\rPlanetScope Surface Reflectance product is orthorectified, 4-band BGRN or 8-band Coastal Blue, Blue, Green I, Green, Yellow, Red, RedEdge, NIR Imagery with geometric, radiometric and corrected for surface reflection. This data is optimal for value-added image processing such as land cover classifications.\rPlanetScope Analytic Ortho Scene Surface Reflectance product is orthorectified, 4-band BGRN or 8-band Coastal Blue, Blue, Green I, Green, Yellow, Red, RedEdge, NIR Imagery with geometric, radiometric and calibrated to top of atmosphere radiance.\r\rAs per ESA policy, very high-resolution imagery of conflict areas cannot be provided.",
