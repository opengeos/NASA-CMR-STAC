    "description": "Forest/Other wooded land of naturally regenerated native species where there are clearly visible indications of human activities.\n\nIncludes, but not limited to: selectively logged-over areas, areas naturally regenerating following agricultural land use, areas recovering from human-induced, etc.\n\nIncludes areas where it is not possible to distinguish whether the regeneration has been natural or assisted. Land under natural or planted stands of trees, whether productive or not. This category includes land from which forests have been cleared but that will be reforested in the foreseeable future, but it excludes woodland or forest used only for recreation purposes. The question of shrub land, savannah, etc. raises the same problem as in the category \"Permanent meadows and pastures\". The Forest and Woodlands reporting was done from an agricultural perspective and handled forests as a side issue. Partly for this reason, the time  series was discontinued in mid-1990s as it did not correspond to FAO figures on forest developments.\n",
