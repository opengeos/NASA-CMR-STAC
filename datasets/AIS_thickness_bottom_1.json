    "description": "Point datasets showing ice thickness over the Amery Ice Shelf and Lambert Glacier Basin were collected by Rachael Hurd under contract with the Glaciology program of the Australian Antarctic Division in 2007. All available metadata for these datasets (how the data were originally collected, resolution, accuracy, etc) were also collected, and recorded in the one document. \nThe surveys collated were:\n\n1.ANARE_5759 - ANARE seismic and gravity survey during the period of the IGY (1957-59)\n2.AMERY_6871 - ANARE Amery Ice Shelf Expedition 1968 and 1970/71.\n3.PCMTS_7274 - ANARE Aerial RES of the Southern Prince Charles Mountains 1972/73 and 1973/74. 17 sorties. \n4.ENDERBY_7980 - ANARE Aerial RES of Enderby and Kemp Lands, 1979/80\n5.AMERY89 - ANARE Aerial RES of Amery Ice Shelf 1989, December 1989, First Phase.\n6.AMERY_89B - ANARE Aerial RES of Amery Ice Shelf, December 1989, Second Phase.\n7.LAMBERT_8995 - ANARE Lambert Glacier Basin Traverse 1989/90 to 1994/95.\n8.WILHELM_9798 - ANARE Airborne RES data Jan-Feb 1998. \n9.Airborne RES data collected by ANARE - Jan-Feb 2000.\n10.Airborne RES data (icards) collected on the AIS by ANARE (2002/2003) as part of the Australian Antarctica and Southern Ocean Profiling Project  (AASOPP).\n11.Airborne RES data collected on the southern AIS and over the PCMs (2002/2003) as part of the PCMEGA project.\n12.Airborne RES data collected on the AIS (2003/2004) in collaboration with Italian expedition.\n13.SAE_7174_1 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE17-19) airborne RES survey in Enderby Land east to West Ice shelf (1971-74). \n14.SAE_7174_2 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition seismic surveys - East Antarctica (1970/71 - 1983/84).\n15.SAE_8586_1 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE31) airborne RES survey - Prince Charles Mountains (1985-86).\n16.SAE_8687 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE32) airborne RES survey - Amery Ice shelf and Ingrid Christensen Coast (1986-87).\n17.SAE_8788_1 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE33) airborne RES survey - Prince Charles Mountains, Mac Robertson Land (1987-88). \n18.SAE_8788_2 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE33) airborne RES survey - Enderby LandMac Robertson Land (1987-88). \n19.SAE_8889_2 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE34) airborne RES survey - Dronning Maud Land (1988-89). \n20.SAE_8990 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE35) airborne RES survey - Lambert Glacier, Mac Robertson Land (1989-90). \n21.SAE_8990_2 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE35) airborne RES survey - Enderby Land (Oct - Nov 1989).\n22.SAE_9091 - Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE36) airborne RES survey - Princess Elizabeth Land (1990-91). \n23.RAE_9495 - Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE39) airborne RES survey - Amery Ice Shelf and Mac Robertson Land (1994-95). \n24.RAE_9596 - Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE40) airborne RES survey - Mac Robertson Land (1995-96). \n\nUsing the metadata as a guide on data quality, the individual datasets were then merged by Rob Driessen (Datavision, now known as RIA Mobile GIS) to create a merged ice thickness dataset for the Amery Ice Shelf. The order of priority and rules of merging for each of the datasets was determined by Ian Allison, with several combinations tried until a set of results that was determined to be reasonable was obtained.\n\nThe intention was to interpolate an ice thickness grid from the merged point dataset. This grid could then be subtracted from a surface DEM to get a get an elevation grid of the bottom of the ice shelf. In the longer term the whole process could be repeated for the whole Lambert Glacier Basin.",
