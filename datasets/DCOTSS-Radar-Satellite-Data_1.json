    "description": "DCOTSS-Radar-Satellite-Data feature the radar and satellite data products for the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere sub-orbital campaign. Featured in this product are NEXRAD WSR-88D radar products and GOES-16 and GOES-17 geostationary satellite imagery and derived products. NEXRAD GridRad data were produced at a 10-minute frequency across the contiguous United States to support forecasting and flight planning activities. GridRad data also include volumes of radar reflectivity at horizontal polarization and radial velocity spectrum width, which were primarily used to identify tropopause-overshooting convection. Identified GridRad overshoots, which rely upon ERA5 tropopause heights, are included in separate daily files.\r\nAlso included are GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellite products. Tropopause-overshooting convection is also identified using GOES visible and infrared geostationary satellite imagery. These products include derived cloud top altitude, convective overshoot probability, and visible texture rating product and are produced in 10-minute intervals. The product domain extends over North America and encompasses most of Mexico and Canada. The satellite overshoot products complement the GridRad products and enable an understanding of overshooting that occurs outside the NEXRAD network. Data collection for this product is ongoing and currently only features the first deployment.\r\n\r\nEach summer the North American Monsoon Anticyclone (NAMA) dominates the circulation of the North-Western Hemisphere and acts to partially confine and isolate air from the surrounding atmosphere. Strong convective storms in the NAMA regularly reach altitudes deep into the lower stratosphere, with some ascending above 20 km. These storms carry water and pollutants from the troposphere into the otherwise very dry stratosphere, where they can have a significant impact on radiative and chemical processes, potentially including destruction of stratospheric ozone. The Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) field campaign is a NASA Earth Venture Suborbital research project aimed at investigating these thunderstorms. DCOTSS utilizes NASA\u2019s ER-2 aircraft and conducted two ~8-week science deployments based out of Salina, KS spanning early to late summer.",
