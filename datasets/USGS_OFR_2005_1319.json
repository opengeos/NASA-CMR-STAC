    "description": "The overall goal of our research on Bear Lake is to create records of past\nclimate change for the region, including changes in precipitation (rain and\nsnow) patterns during the last 10,000 years and longer. As part of the project,\nwe are attempting to determine how the size of Bear Lake has varied in the past\nin order to assess the possibility of future flooding and drought. We also seek\nto understand human influences on sediment deposition, chemistry, and life in\nthe lake.\n\nEvidence of past conditions comes from sediments deposited in the lake, so\nreconstructions of past conditions require accurate dating of the sediments.\nThe study includes the upper Bear River watershed as well as Bear Lake. The\nBear River is the largest river in the Great Basin and the source of the\nmajority of water flowing into the Great Salt Lake. In this region, wet periods\nmay produce flooding along the course of the Bear River and around Great Salt\nLake, while dry periods, or droughts, may affect water availability for\necosystems, as well as for agricultural, industrial, and residential use.\n\nDiatoms are one of the most sensitive indicators of environments in many lakes.\nIn addition to species compositions and abundances (Moser and Kimball, 2005),\ntotal diatom productivity commonly varies considerably with changes in\nlimnological conditions. Biogenic silica preserved in sediments is an index of\ntotal diatom productivity and, thus, is an indirect proxy for paleolimnology\n(for example, Colman and others, 1995; Johnson and others, 2001). In this\npaper, we present the results of biogenic silica analyses of two cores taken in\nBear Lake, Utah, and discuss preliminary paleolimnologic conclusions based on\nthese data.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
