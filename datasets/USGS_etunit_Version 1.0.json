    "description": "The data set was created to delineate the aerial extent and quantify acreage of\nthe different ET units found within the many major discharge areas of the Death\nValley regional flow system.\n\nThe raster-based classification of evapotranspiration (ET) units is for nine\nmajor discharge areas in the Death Valley regional flow system. The ET units\ndelineate general areas of similar vegetation and soil-moisture conditions.\nClassifications were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery data acquired\nJune 13, 1992; Sept. 1, 1992; and June 21, 1989.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe raster-based classification of ET units within the major discharge areas of\nthe Death Valley regional flow system determined from Landsat Thematic Mapper\n(TM) imagery data acquired June 13, 1992, Sept. 1, 1992; and June 21, 1989.\nBackground information on classification procedures can be found in American\nSociety of Photogrammetry (1983). Except for Sarcobatus Flat, all discharge\nareas were classified using the 1992 TM imagery. An accurate classification of\nSarcobatus Flat could not be attained from 1992 TM imagery because of extensive\ncloud cover over the area. Instead, Sarcobatus Flat was classified from TM data\nacquired June 21, 1989.\n\nReviews\n\nThe final classification of ET units within each major discharge area was\nchecked for consistency and accuracy during data processing. Two external\nreviews were done. The reviewers were asked to check metadata and other\ndocumentation files for completeness and accuracy. Reviewers also were asked to\ncheck the topological consistency, tolerances, projections, and geographic\nextent.",
