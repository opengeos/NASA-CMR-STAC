    "description": "This is a scanned copy of the report by the wintering aquatic chemist at Davis Station in the Vestfold Hills, John Gibson.\n\nTaken from the introduction of the report:\n\nThis report covers work undertaken at Davis during the period December 1993-February 1995.  It does not attempt to interpret most of the results obtained, rather present the data so that it is available for further analysis.  The dataset is not complete - some analyses are yet to be finished.\n\nAim\nThe basic aim of the project was to study carbon flow through three environments in the Davis area.  The approach taken was to measure the concentrations and fluxes of as many forms of carbon as possible, as well as many supporting parameters.  The sites chosen were:\n\n1. Inshore marine - this site at 704905, generally called the O'Gorman Rocks site , was selected so that it would be accessible for nearly the complete year (as compared to sites further offshore, which would have considerable periods of isolation).  It also was the site of study by the author during the 1992-93 summer and by others during the 1993 winter.  Thus we have three summers' and two winters' continuous data from this site.\n\n2. Ellis Fjord - this site was chosen as a model for the marine system, with the advantage that little exchange occurs between the fjord and the ocean.  The actual site used was at 833873 - this point was chosen as it was at a deep spot as far from the fjord mouth as possible without being in the Deep Meromictic Basin, where anoxic bottom water could not interfere with the water chemistry.  Water depth at the site was circa 73 m.\n\n3.  Ace Lake - the lake was chosen as it is a marine derived system which is now completely isolated from the ocean.  The actual site chosen was near the deep spot in approximately 24 m of water.",
