    "description": "Surficial geologic maps along the riparian zone of the Animas River and its\nheadwater tributaries, Silverton to Durango, Colorado, with upper Animas River\nwatershed gradient profiles\n\n   This map data was completed for the purpose of identifying the surficial\ndeposits along the riparian zone of the Animas River and its major headwater\ntributaries.  Mapped surficial units that were deposited before and after the\nonset of mining were analyzed to determine the geochemical baseline of\nsediments in the watershed.\n\n   This product consists of Adobe Acrobat .PDF format documents for 10\nsurficial geologic strip maps along the Animas River watershed from its major\nheadwater tributaries, south to Durango, Colo.  The Animas River originates in\nthe San Juan Mountains north of the historic mining town of Silverton, Colo. \nThe surficial geologic maps identify surficial deposits, such as floodplain,\nand terrace gravels, alluvial fans, glacial till, talus, colluvium, landslides,\nand bogs.  Sixteen primary units were mapped that included human-related\ndeposits and structures, eight alluvial deposits, four colluvial deposits, one\nglacial deposit, one travertine deposit, and undifferentiated bedrock.  Each of\nthe surficial geologic strip maps has .PDF links to surficial geology\nphotographs, which enables the user to take a virtual tour of these deposits. \nGeochemical data collected from mapped surficial deposits that pre-date and\npost-date mining activity have aided in determining the geochemical baseline in\nthe watershed.  Several photographs with their corresponding geochemical\nbaseline profiles are accessible through .PDF links from several of the maps. \nA single coverage for all surficial deposits mapped is included as an ArcInfo\nshape file and as an Arc Export format .e00 file.\n\n   This product consists of one vector coverage.  This coverage is that of the\nsurficial deposits mapped along the riparian zone of the Animas River from its\nheadwater tributaries above Silverton to Durango, Colo.",
