    "description": "The conceptual model for this study is based on the idea that hydroperiod is a long-term process that primarily influences the abundance, body size, and species composition of the prey community whereas water depth has immediate effects on individual birds by influencing their ability to capture prey. This study seeks to determine through field experiments, the proximate effects of water depth, prey density, prey size, and prey species on wading bird foraging parameters. The species of wading birds examined in this study are those in the ATLSS wading bird model: the Wood Stork, White Ibis, Great Egret, and Great Blue Heron.\n      \n      The recovery of wading bird populations has been identified as a key component of successful Everglades restoration. Proposed causes for the decline in wading bird numbers have in common the notion that current hydropatterns have altered the availability of prey. Indeed, food availability may be the single most important factor limiting populations of wading birds in the Everglades. In the face of conflicting management scenarios, knowing the relative importance of each component of food availability is a precursor to understanding the effects of specific water management regimes on wading birds. Ongoing modeling efforts in south Florida such as the ATLSS program, integrate such information and provide predictive power for future management decisions. Currently, the biggest information gap limiting the wading bird model of ATLSS is foraging success as a function of prey availability. The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) is currently conducting a series of experiments aimed at determining the effects of water management on the use of foraging sites by wading birds. Site-use data are available immediately after each experiment and thus allow for quick analyses and write-up. However, also as part of those experiments, we recorded on film, foraging behavior of wading birds at feeding sites with known prey availabilities.",
