    "description": "The MOD11B1.004 dataset was decommissioned as of October 23, 2017. Users are encouraged to use Version 6 of MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily L3 Global 6 km Grid SIN (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod11b1.006).\r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Terra V4 LST/E L3 Global 5 Km Grid product (Short name: MOD11B1) incorporates 5-km pixels, which is produced using the day/night LST algorithm (Wan and Li, 1997). This algorithm extracts average temperatures (in Kelvin) and applies them to a pair of MODIS daytime and nighttime observations. This method yields 1 K accuracy for materials with known emissivities. The six thermal band emissivities are estimated through a classification-based look-up table (LUT). The data inputs include the MODIS L1B calibrated and geolocated radiances, geolocation, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, land and snow cover.\r\n\r\nThe V4 MOD11B1 products are a gridded version of the level-2 LST product (MOD11_L2) mapped and projected on 5-kilometer (precisely 4.63 km) Sinusoidal grids. The MOD11B1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, and emissivities from bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32. It also includes daytime and nighttime LSTs generated from the 1-km, band 31 of the level-2 MOD11_L2 product aggregated to 5 km grids.\r\n\r\nThe V4 Terra/MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11B1, are validated to Stage-1 with well-defined uncertainties over a range of representative conditions. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MOD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications. Subsequent and improved versions of this product also exist.\r\n\r\nThe V4 MOD11B1 product has a temporal acquisition range, which starts February 24, 2000 (2000-055) until January 3, 2007 (200-003). The V4 collection remains consistent with V41, and users may combine the two collections in a time-series analysis.\r\n\r\nV004 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 2(240 x 240) rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~1.9 MB \r\nResolution: 5 kilometer (actual: 4.63 km) \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 17",
