    "description": "These data consist of soil moisture sensor, soil temperature and air temperature measurements recorded by 25 temporary stations in the Millbrook (MB) experiment location during SMAPVEX19-22. The stations were spread out over the experiment domain of about 30 by 40 km located around Millbrook, NY. The stations were installed in May 2019 and are to continue operation until 2022. Note that the product is named SMAPVEX19-22 because, although the current coverage is through 2021, it is projected to include 2022 data in the future.",
