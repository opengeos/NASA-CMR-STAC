    "description": "The prevailing view of a wolf (Canis lupus) pack is that of a group of\nindividuals ever vying for dominance but held in check by the \"alpha\" pair, the\nalpha male and the alpha female. Most research on the social dynamics of wolf\npacks, however, has been conducted on non-natural assortments of captive\nwolves. Here I describe the wolf-pack social order as it occurs in nature,\ndiscuss the alpha concept and social dominance and submission, and present data\non the precise relationships among members in free-living packs based on a\nliterature review and 13 summers of observations of wolves on Ellesmere Island,\nNorthwest Territories, Canada. I conclude that the typical wolf pack is a\nfamily, with the adult parents guiding the activities of the group in a\ndivision-of-labor system in which the female predominates primarily in such\nactivities as pup care and defense and the male primarily during foraging and\nfood-provisioning and the travels associated with them.",
