    "description": "The MYD11B1.041 dataset was decommissioned as of March 1, 2018. Users are encouraged to use Version 6 of MODIS/Aqua Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily L3 Global 6 km Grid SIN (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11b1.006). \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua version-041 (V41) products use a modified version-4 (V4) LST algorithm and version-5 (V5) data inputs. The V41 products primarily address underestimation problems in the V5 Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) products. Recent validation activities reveal that the V5 CMG products underestimate LSTs up to 6K especially in desert and semi-arid regions. The production date for this collection starts from MODIS/Aqua data acquisition date 2007-001. This beginning date is driven by the availability of the MODIS V5 data inputs (level-1B radiance data, geolocation data, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, and land and snow cover data).\r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua V4 LST/E L3 Global 5 km Grid product (Short name: MYD11B1) incorporates 5-km pixels, which is produced using the day/night LST algorithm (Wan and Li, 1997). This algorithm extracts average temperatures (in Kelvin) and applies them to a pair of MODIS daytime and nighttime observations. This method yields 1 K accuracy for materials with known emissivities. The six thermal band emissivities are estimated through a classification-based look-up table (LUT). The data inputs include the MODIS L1B calibrated and geolocated radiances, geolocation, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, land and snow cover.\r\n\r\nThe V41 MYD11B1 products are a gridded version of the level-2 LST product (MYD11_L2) mapped and projected on 5-kilometer (precisely 4.63 km) Sinusoidal grids. The MYD11B1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, and emissivities from bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32. It also includes daytime and nighttime LSTs generated from the 1-km, band 31 of the level-2 MYD11_L2 product aggregated to 5 km grids.\r\n\r\nThe V41 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11B1, are validated to Stage-1 with well-defined uncertainties over a range of representative conditions. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications. Subsequent and improved versions of this product also exist.\r\n\r\nThe V41 MYD11B1 product\u2019s acquisition range started January 1, 2007 (2007-001), and continued through March 30, 2017. The V41 LST products from 2007-001 will remain consistent with similar products from V4, and hence are amenable to combine them in a time series analysis. Users should exercise caution, and not mix the V4.x (i.e., V4 and V41) and V5 LST products in their analysis.\r\n\r\nV041 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 240 x 240 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~1.9 MB \r\nResolution: ~5 kilometers (actual 4.63 km)\r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 17",
