    "description": "MI1AOBC_2 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) OBC Data version 2. This file contains the output for the Level 1A On-board Calibrator Data and it provides the radiometry from PIN and HQE diodes and goniometer mechanism readings collected during calibration mode operations near the north and south poles and over the dark side of the Earth (or during science mode operations over the sunlit side of the Earth). The diode radiometry acquired during north and south pole calibration sequences will be used to determine brightness and reflective characteristics of a MISR diffuser panel as observed by each of the nine MISR cameras. The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.",
