    "description": "A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Larsemann Hills with cell size 10 metres was interpolated from input coastline, contour, spot height (point locations with an elevation attribute) and lake data from the dataset described by the metadata record 'Larsemann Hills - Mapping from aerial photography captured February 1998' with Entry ID: gis135.\nThe input data for the islands and much of the continent coastal area is estimated to have horizontal accuracy of about 5 metres and vertical accuracy of about 5 metres. The input data for a mainly inland area in the south-east of the data coverage is estimated to have horizontal accuracy of about 15 metres and vertical accuracy of about 15 metres. The spatial coverage for these two categories of input data is shown in a map linked to this metadata record.\nThe interpolation was done using the Topo to Raster tool in ArcGIS.\nIn the interpolation process all cells within a lake are assigned to the minimum elevation value of all cells along the shoreline. i.e. the interpolation is flat across the lake.\nThe output DEM was clipped to the extents of the input data.\nThe dataset available from a Related URL in this metadata record includes a text file with the parameters used with the Topo to Raster tool.\nThe DEM is stored in the UTM Zone 43S projection.\nThe horizontal datum is WGS84. The vertical datum is Mean Sea Level.\nThe DEM was initially created as a raster in an ESRI file geodatabase. The geodatabase also includes slope, aspect and hillshade rasters derived from the DEM using ArcGIS. Slope is in degrees. Azimuth 315 degrees and altitude 45 degrees were chosen for the hillshade.\nThe DEM was exported using ArcGIS to two other formats which are included in the dataset available from a Related URL in this metadata record:\n1 A geotiff; and \n2 An ascii file in ESRI's ascii format for rasters.",
