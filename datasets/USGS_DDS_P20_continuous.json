    "description": "The purpose of the play map is to illustrate the geologic boundary of\nthe play as defined for the 1995 U.S. National Assessment. The play\nwas used as the fundamental assessment unit.\n\nThe fundamental geologic unit used in the 1995 National Oil and Gas\nAssessment was the play, which is defined as a set of known or\npostulated oil and or gas accumulations sharing similar geologic,\ngeographic, and temporal properties, such as source rock, migration\npathways, timing, trapping mechanism, and hydrocarbon type. The\ngeographic limit of each play was defined and mapped by the geologist\nresponsible for each province. The play boundaries were defined\ngeologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the\nplay, such as the limits of the reservoir rock, geologic structures,\nsource rock, and seal lithologies. The only exceptions to this are\nplays that border the Federal-State water boundary. In these cases,\nthe Federal-State water boundary forms part of the play boundary.  The\nplay boundaries were defined in the period 1993-1994.\n\nContinuous oil and gas plays within province 20 (Uinta - Piceance\nBasin) are listed here by play number and name:\n\n   Number  Name\n    2007   Tight Gas Piceance Mesaverde Williams Fork\n    2009   Cretaceous Self-Sourced Fractured Shales Oil\n    2010   Tight Gas Piceance Mesaverde Iles\n    2015   Tight Gas Uinta Tertiary East\n    2016   Tight Gas Uinta Tertiary West\n    2018   Basin Flank Uinta Mesaverde\n    2020   Deep Synclinal Uinta Mesaverde\n    2050   Uinta Basin - Book Cliffs\n    2051   Uinta Basin - Sego\n    2052   Uinta Basin - Emery\n    2053   Piceance Basin - White River Dome\n    2054   Piceance Basin - Western Basin Margin\n    2055   Piceance Basin - Grand Hogback\n    2056   Piceance Basin - Divide Creek Anticline\n    2057   Piceance Basin - Igneous Intrusion",
