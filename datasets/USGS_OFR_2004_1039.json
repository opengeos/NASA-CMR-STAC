    "description": "The Western Idaho Suture Zone (WISZ) represents the boundary between crust\noverlying Proterozoic North American lithosphere and Late Paleozoic and\nMesozoic intraoceanic crust accreted during Cretaceous time. Highly deformed\nplutons constituted of both arc and sialic components intrude the WISZ and in\nplaces are thrust over the accreted terranes. Pronounced variations in Sr, Nd,\nand O isotope ratios and in major and trace element composition occur across\nthe suture zone in Mesozoic plutons. The WISZ is located by an abrupt west to\neast increase in initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, traceable for over 300 km from\neastern Washington near Clarkston, east along the Clearwater River thorough a\nbend to the south of about 110\u00b0 from Orofino Creek to Harpster, and extending\nsouth-southwest to near Ola, Idaho, where Columbia River basalts conceal its\nextension to the south. K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar apparent ages of hornblende and\nbiotite from Jurassic and Early Cretaceous plutons in the accreted terranes are\nhighly discordant within about 10 km of the WISZ, exhibiting patterns of\nthermal loss caused by deformation, subsequent batholith intrusion, and rapid\nrise of the continental margin. Major crustal movements within the WISZ\ncommenced after about 135 Ma, but much of the displacement may have been\nlargely vertical, during and following emplacement of batholith-scale silicic\nmagmas. Deformation continued until at least 85 Ma and probably until 74 Ma,\nprogressing from south to north.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
