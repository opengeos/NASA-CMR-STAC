    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data set that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis. \n\nThis data set consists of digital polygons of constant hydraulic conductivity\nvalues for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the Cimarron River from\nFreedom to Guthrie in northwestern Oklahoma. Ground water in 1,305 square miles\nof Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits along the the Cimarron River\nfrom Freedom to Guthrie is an important source of water for irrigation,\nindustrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. Alluvial and terrace\ndeposits are composed of interfingering lenses of clay, sandy clay, and\ncross-bedded poorly sorted sand and gravel. The aquifer is composed of\nhydraulically connected alluvial and terrace deposits that uncomfortably\noverlie the Permian-age Formations.\n\nThe hydraulic-conductivity values for alluvial and terrace deposits used in\nthis data set were published in a steady-state ground-water flow modeling\nreport. The aquifer boundaries along geological contacts were extracted from\npublished digital geology data sets. Boundaries defining the geographic limits\nof the aquifer were digitized from a mylar map, at a scale of 1:250,000. The\nmaps were published at a scale of 1:900,000. The hydraulic conductivity values\nare 104.5 feet per day for the alluvial deposits and 47.5 feet per day for the\nterrace deposits.\n\nGround-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and\naggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of\naquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of\nhydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented in this data set are not\nprecise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently\ncollected data.",
