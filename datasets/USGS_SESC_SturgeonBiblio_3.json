    "description": "This functional bibliography is meant to be a complete and comprehensive bibliography of all discoverable reports containing information on the Gulf Sturgeon (GS). This bibliography contains all known reports presenting, documenting, summarizing, listing, or interpreting information on the GS through 31 December 2013. Report citations are organized into four sections. Section I includes published scientific journal articles, books, dissertations and theses, published and unpublished technical reports, published harvest prohibitions, and online articles reporting substantive scientific information. Section II includes newspaper, newsletter, magazine, book, agency news releases, and online articles reporting on GS occurrences, mortalities, captures, jumping, boat collisions, aquaculture, historical photographs, and other largely non-scientific or anecdotal issues. Section III consists of books, theses, ecotour-guides, media articles, editorials, and blogs reporting a mix of anecdotal information, historical information, and opinion on GS conservation, habitat issues, exploitation, aquaculture, and human interaction - but presenting very limited or no substantive scientific information. Section IV includes videos, films and audio recordings documenting GS life history and behavior.\n\nEach reference includes a bibliographic citation, as well as a brief annotation of key topics in brackets, where possible. The names of journals, theses, dissertations, and books are given in bold within each citation, and relevant page numbers are noted in parentheses at the end of citations, where applicable. Newspaper and magazine article titles are placed within parentheses. Key topic annotations are inserted in bracketed italics on a separate line. If the reference reports GS information under a different common or scientific name (e.g., Atlantic Sturgeon, Common Sturgeon, Sturgeon, Sea Sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus, Acipenser oxyrhynchus or Acipenser sturio), a notation to that effect is given within the key words annotation line, e.g., [Reported as \"Atlantic sturgeon\"]. A small number of reports could not be obtained. These include historical reports from newspapers and magazines long out of circulation. In these limited cases, titles are still provided to substantiate their existence. Other reports that are no longer readily available, but which have been obtained during preparation of this bibliography, have been archived in hardcopy and/or as scanned pdf files at USGS, SESC. Copies of such hard to obtain reports, if non-copyrighted, may be available upon request from USGS corresponding author, via email: mrandall@usgs.gov.",
