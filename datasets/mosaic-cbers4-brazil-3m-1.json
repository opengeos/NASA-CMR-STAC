    "description": "CBERS-4/WFI image mosaic of Brazil with 64m of spatial resolution. The mosaic was prepared in order to demonstrate the technological capabilities of the Brazil Data Cube project tools. The false color composition is based on the WFI bands 15, 16 and 13 assigned to RGB channels. The temporal composition encompasses 03-months of images, starting in April 2020 and ending in June 2020, with a best pixel selection approach called Least Cloud Cover First (LCF). More information on LCF can be found at Brazil Data Cube web site (https://brazil-data-cube.github.io/specifications/processing-flow.html#temporal-compositing). This Image Mosaic used more than 1200 CBERS-4 scenes and was generated based on an existing CBERS-4/WFI image collection.",
