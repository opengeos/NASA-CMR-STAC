    "description": "The National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPRA) is located in the primitive\n            wilderness of Alaska's North Slope. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) began\n            some geological surveying in this area in the early 1900's, and the U.S. Navy\n            began geological and geophysical surveys and drilling in 1945 to appraise the\n            petroleum potential of the Reserve.  Information on surveys prior to 1955 may\n            be obtained from the Branch of Alaskan Geology at:\n                 Alaska Technical Data Unit\n                 Mail Stop 48\n                 U.S. Geological Survey\n                 345 Middlefield Road\n                 Menlo Park, CA 94025.\n            \n            SEISMIC DATA:\n            Common Depth Point (CDP) seismic reflection data and documentation covering\n            about 13,000 miles for 1972-81 are available from USGS. Full-scale (5 in./sec)\n            sections are available for most of the lines, which were shot at either 6-,\n            12-, or 24-fold multiplicity. Data sets include index maps, shot-point location\n            maps, seismic sections and velocity analyses.\n            \n            MAJOR DATA SETS:\n                 CDP seismic reflection data\n                 Reprocessed seismic sections\n                 Seismic reflection field tapes\n                 Processed field tapes\n                 Miscellaneous Geophysical data tapes\n                 Barrow data\n                 Stacking velocities\n            \n            \n            Anciliary Data for the Seismic Data:\n            \n            TIME, VELOCITY, DEPTH DATA\n            This file contains time, velocity and depth (TVD) information for up to 25\n            identified seismic horizons. Position information includes line number, shot-\n            point number, latitude and longitude for most of 1972-1981. These data were\n            generated by Petroleum Information for 1981. The data are preliminary and are\n            from Terra Tech (contractor).\n            \n            SHOT-POINT LOCATION DATA\n            This file contains position information for shot locations during 1972-1981.\n            The file was created by National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) from TVD data\n            and other shot-point tapes.\n            \n            ELEVATION DATA\n            Elevation data for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska includes elevation,\n            northing and easting information for 1972-1979. This file was created by Tetra\n            Tech (contractor for USGS) and contains position information, including line\n            number, shot point, latitude and longitude.",
