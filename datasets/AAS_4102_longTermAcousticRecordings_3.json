    "description": "This dataset contains long-term underwater acoustic recordings made under Australian Antarctic Science Projects 4101 and 4102, and the International Whaling Commission\u2019s Southern Ocean Research Partnership (IWC-SORP) Southern Ocean Hydrophone Network (SOHN). \nCalibrated measurements of sound pressure were made at several sites across several years using  custom moored acoustic recorders (MARs) designed and manufactured by the Science Technical Support group of the Australian Antarctic Division. These moored acoustic recorders were designed to operate for year-long, deep-water, Antarctic deployments. Each moored acoustic recorder included a factory calibrated HTI 90-U hydrophone and workshop-calibrated frontend electronics (hydrophone preamplifier, bandpass filter, and analog-digital converter), and used solid state digital storage (SDHC) to reduce power consumption and mechanical self-noise (e.g. from hard-drives with motors and rotating disks). Electronics were placed in a glass instrumentation sphere rated to a depth of 6000 m, and the sphere was attached to a short mooring with nylon straps to decouple recorder and hydrophone from sea-bed. The hydrophone was mounted above the glass sphere with elastic connections to the mooring frame to reduce mechanical self-noise from movement of the hydrophone. The target noise floor of each recorder was below that expected for a quiet ocean at sea state zero. The analog-digital converter, based on an AD7683B chip, provides 100 dB of spurious free dynamic range, but a total signal-to-noise and distortion of 86 dB which yields 14 effective bits of dynamic range at a 1 kHz input frequency. \n The data for each recording site comprise a folder of 16-bit WAV audio files recorded at a nominal sample rate of 12 kHz. The names of each WAV file correspond to a deployment code followed by the start time (in UTC) of the file as determined by the microprocessor\u2019s real-time clock e.g. 201_2013-12-25_13-00-00.wav would correspond to a wav file with deployment code 201 that starts at 1 pm on December 25th 2013 (UTC). \nRecording locations were chosen to correspond to sites used during AAS Project 2683. These sites were along the resupply routes for Australia\u2019s Antarctic stations, and typically there was only one opportunity to recover and redeploy MARs each year.",
