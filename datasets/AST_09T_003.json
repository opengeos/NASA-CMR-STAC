    "description": "The ASTER Surface Radiance TIR (AST_09T) is generated (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/996/ASTER_Earthdata_Search_Order_Instructions.pdf) using the five Thermal Infrared (TIR) bands (acquired either during the day or night time) between 8 and 12 \u00b5m spectral range. It provides surface-leaving radiance for the TIR bands at a spatial resolution of 90 meters, which includes both surface-emitted and surface-reflected components. It also provides the downwelling sky irradiance values (in W/m2/\u00b5m) for each of the TIR bands. This product is atmospherically corrected, and the surface-leaving radiance is of known accuracy and valid only for clear-sky scenes (cloud-free pixels). This atmospherically corrected product provides the input for generating two other higher-level products: surface spectral emissivity and surface kinetic temperature.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm to correct atmospheric effects involves two elements: 1) it uses a radiative transfer model which is capable of estimating the magnitude of atmospheric emission, absorption, and scattering. It uses the Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code (MODTRAN) radiative transfer model, which calculates atmospheric transmittance and radiance for frequencies from 0 to 50,000 cm\u02c9\u00b9 at moderate spectral resolution. 2) It identifies and incorporates all the necessary atmospheric parameters applicable to the location and time for which the measurements require correction. These include temperature, water vapor, elevation, ozone, and aerosols.\r\n\r\n ASTER Level 2 data requests for observations that occurred after May 27, 2020 will resort back to using the climatology ozone input. Additional information can be found in the ASTER L2 Processing Options Update (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/news/aster-l2-processing-options-update/).\r\n\r\nStarting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.\r\n\r\nTsuchida, S., Yamamoto, H., Kouyama, T., Obata, K., Sakuma, F., Tachikawa, T., Kamei, A., Arai, K., Czapla-Myers, J.S., Biggar, S.F., and Thome, K.J., 2020, Radiometric Degradation Curves for the ASTER VNIR Processing Using Vicarious and Lunar Calibrations: Remote Sensing, v. 12, no. 3, at https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030427.\r\n\r\nAs of December 15, 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented changes to ASTER PGE Version 3.4, which will affect all ASTER Level 2 on-demand products.  Changes include:\r\n\u2022\tAura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27, 2020.  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the same.\r\n\u2022\tToolkit has been updated from Version 5.2.17 to 5.2.20.  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions.  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance (AST07 and AST09) QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Climatology, which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture, Temperature and Pressures (MTP) will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form.  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis.  Climatology will continue to be used as the final default if neither of the first two selectable options are available for Ozone and MTP.  Users can check the OPERATIONALQUALITYFLAGEXPLANATION field in the metadata or the output file for atmospheric parameters that were applied.\r\n\r\n",
