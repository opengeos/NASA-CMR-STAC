    "description": "Injury data for Stellaria media and native plant species collected from Macquarie Island when treated with herbicides at different times and with different rates grown in a plant growth cool room.\n    \nThere are 4 files on injury data for Stellaria media and native plant species collected from Macquarie Island when treated with herbicides at different times and with different rates grown in pots in a plant growth cool room at the University of New England. The first file provides injury data for the first experiment recorded on a scale from 1-10 (from least to most injury) for 7 herbicides and a water control for post-emergence application on Stellaria media alone when herbicides were applied at their recommended rates. The second file provides seedling emergence, leaf number and dry weight of Stellaria media plants in pots for herbicides applied pre-emergence in a second experiment at either the recommended rate or half the recommended rate. The third file provides injury data for three weeds and several native species in a third experiment when herbicides were applied post-emergence at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 x the recommended rate to determine selectivity of herbicides between Stellaria media and the other weeds on the island and several of the more common and co-occurring native species. The last file contains graphs and statistical analyses of the results for the above 3 experiments. More detailed methods are provided in the Master of Science in Agriculture thesis of Waqas Zahid (University of New England, 2018).\n\nInitial screening of herbicides on S. media, the closely related alien, C. fontanum, and several native species in pots under sub-Antarctic conditions in the dedicated UNE facility using live plants collected from MI. While herbicides may be used in various situations in the Arctic and sub-Antarctic, MI managers have preferred us to trial herbicides off island, and use the research outcomes to direct herbicide application decisions. The data will be comprised of plant growth measurements for the weed and a variety of native species and herbicide symptom assessments.",
