    "description": "APIS (Antarctic Pack Ice Seals) was an international program\n      formulated by the SCAR Group on Specialists on Seals to consider the\n      functional significance of upper trophic level predators in the\n      Antarctic pack ice zone and to investigate the seals' interactions\n      with their biological and physical environment.  The US component\n      assessed prey, predators, and environmental variables in the eastern\n      Ross Sea (ca. 67 - 77.5 degrees S and 129 - 180 degrees W) from\n      December 1999 to February 2000.\n      \n      This data set contains acoustic data collected using a Hydroacoustics\n      Technology Inc. (HTI) Model 244 Multi-Frequency System with two\n      transducers (38 and 120 kHz) operating on fast-multiplexed mode.  Data\n      collection includes real-time integration of the acoustic signal in 1\n      m depth bins and the raw, unthresholded digitized signal stored on\n      Digital Audio Tapes.  Sixteen gigabytes of integrated acoustic data\n      were collected plus 54 DAT tapes of raw data. All data were collected\n      using a FM slide (chirp) coded 5 ms pulses, with a slide bandwidth of\n      10 kHz. Matched filter processing of these pulses resulted in an\n      effective pulse resolution (output pulse width) of 0.18 ms. The DAT\n      tapes were reprocessed to correct for calibration offsets based on\n      field standard target sphere measurements and to correct for noise\n      interference for the 120 kHz data. The 38 kHz data was not reanalyzed\n      as it contained much higher and variable noise interference.  Data are\n      available as relative backscattering (SV) and as absolute estimates of\n      target density based on in situ sigma scaling.  The reprocessing was\n      performed by HTI.",
