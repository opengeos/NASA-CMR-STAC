    "description": "AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION\n\nThe annual series of aquaculture production begin in 1950 for the quantities and in 1984 for the values. Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, mollusks, and crustaceans*.\nFarming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture while aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resource, with or without appropriate licenses, are the harvest of fisheries.\n\nProduction of fish, crustaceans and molluscs is expressed in live weight that is the nominal weight of the aquatic organisms at the time of capture Quantities are given in tonnes. \n\n*includes all FAOSTAT group excluded aquatic animals nei, aquatic plants, aquatic mammals\n",
