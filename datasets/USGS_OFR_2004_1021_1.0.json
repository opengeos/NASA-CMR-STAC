    "description": "A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was used to map the relative vulnerability\nof the coast to future sea-level rise within Olympic National Park (OLYM),\nWashington. The CVI scores the following in terms of their physical\ncontribution to sea-level rise-related coastal change: geomorphology, regional\ncoastal slope, rate of relative sea-level rise, shoreline change rates, mean\ntidal range and mean wave height. The rankings for each variable were combined\nand an index value calculated for 1-minute grid cells covering the park. The\nCVI highlights those regions where the physical effects of sea-level rise might\nbe the greatest. This approach combines the coastal system's susceptibility to\nchange with its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions,\nyielding a quantitative, although relative, measure of the park's natural\nvulnerability to the effects of sea-level rise. The CVI provides an objective\ntechnique for evaluation and long-term planning by scientists and park\nmanagers. The Olympic National Park coast consists of rocky headlands, pocket\nbeaches, glacial-fluvial features, and sand and gravel beaches. The Olympic\ncoastline that is most vulnerable to sea-level rise are beaches in gently\nsloping areas.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
