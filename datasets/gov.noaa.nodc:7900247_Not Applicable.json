    "description": "Bacteriology, wind wave spectra, and benthic organism data were collected using moored buoy casts and other instruments in the Gulf of Mexico from February 1, 1978 to May 3, 1979. Data were submitted by Texas A&M University as part of the Brine Disposal project. Data has been been processed by NODC to the standard NODC F009- Bacteriology, F132- Benthic Organisms, and F191- Wind Wave Spectra formats. Full format and format code descriptions are available at http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-datafmts.html.\n\nThe F009 format is designed to support bacteriological studies of the water column and ocean bottom. Information on environmental conditions, physical measurements of the water and sediment, and denisty of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonclastic, and halophilic bacteria are presented. The format contains five data record types, each 80 characters in length, sorted by station ad sequence numbers. The first nine columns for all records are to be used for file name (columns 1-3) and file identifier (columns 4-9). The file identifier, to be assigned by the orginator, is an unique originator id for each data submission. After submission, the NODCreassigns to this field an unique NODC indentifier for internal use.\n\nThe F132 format contains data from field sampling or surveys of bottom dwelling marine organisms. The data provide information on species abundance, distribution, and biomass; they may have been collected by point sampling (grab or core), by tow (dredge, trawl or net), by photographic surveys, or by other methods. Cruise information such as vessel, start and end dates, investigator, and institution/agency; station numbers, positions and times; and equipment and methods are reported for each survey. Environmental data reported at each sampling site may include meteorological and sea surface conditions; surface and bottom temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen; and sediment characteristics. Number of individual organisms and total weight of organisms is reported for each species. A text record is available for comments. \"Self-documenting files containing, [datatypes].\"\n\nThe F191 format is used to report meteorological data and ocean wave spectra data from NDBO. The format contains seven data record types to: 1) Identify the buoy for position, duration, rate of sampling and heading. 2) Identify the meteorological parameters (temperature, pressure, weather, solar radiation, and surface waves). 3) Report time series frequency, density and resolution of waves. Each record is 120 characters in length, sorted by station and record type. The first nine columns for all records are to be used for file type (columns 1-3) and file identifier (column 4-9). The file identifier, to be assigned by the originator, is an unique originator id for each data submission. After submission, the NODC reassigns to this field an unique NODC identifier for internal use.",
