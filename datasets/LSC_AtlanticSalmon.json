    "description": "The eastern coastal rivers of North America have historically supported\nanadromous populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Numbers of these\nanimals have declined due to overfishing and loss of habitat, and population\nnumbers have been supplemented by stocking efforts that span at least the last\nhundred years. Often, these stockings used fish of diverse origins. This is\nexemplified by the fact that several Maine rivers were stocked with Canadian\nfish from at least two locations. Because of this stocking history, it is not\nknown if significant remnants of native Atlantic salmon stocks exist in the\ncoastal rivers of Maine. Atlantic salmon in five Maine rivers were designated\nas category 2 candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act in 1991\nin response to the precipitous decline in population numbers. In October 1993,\nall anadromous U.S. Atlantic salmon were included in a petition to the U.S.\nFish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for a Rule to List the species under the\nEndangered Species Act.\n\nInformation was obtained from http://www.lsc.usgs.gov",
