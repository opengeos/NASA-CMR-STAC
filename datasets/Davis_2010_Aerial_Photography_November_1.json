    "description": "Taken from the report:\n\nThis document describes the results of the use of the APPLS (Aerial Photography Pyrometer LiDAR System) during underway science (sea ice) on the way to Davis, and later at Davis during resupply 2010/2011 (November 16 to 20, 2010). This document is primarily for Science Technical Support use.  Portions of the report can be used to provide information on the results obtained to other parts of AAD.\n\nSome of this aerial photography has also been conducted in support of various AAS projects:\n\nAAS 3012 (ASAC_3012)\nAAS 3113 (ASAC_3113)\nAAS 2205 (ASAC_2205)\nAAS 2425 (ASAC_2425)\nAAS 3154 (ASAC_3154)\nAAS 3189 (ASAC_3189)\n\nA short list of the work carried out:\n\n- 3012, 3113\nThis activity involved long duration over water/sea ice flights for the purposes of \"Investigation of physical and biological processes in the Antarctic sea ice zone during spring using in-situ, aircraft and underwater observations\".\nThis activity was scheduled for prior to Davis, over pack ice far from shore. \nTwo science specific flights were made, and one opportunistic (sea ice reconnaissance), for a total of 5 hours 19 minutes of data collection for dedicated science\n\n- 2205\nPriority 1 - Adelie Penguin Census Survey on the Islands in the Davis vicinity\nThis task was a repeat of aerial census of Adelie penguins, conducted in 2009/2010 with coordinated ground counts of specific islands/colonies on Gardner, Magnetic, Lugg and Turner Islands.   The ground counts were performed at the same time as the aerial survey, to compare aerial versus ground counts.\nPersonnel from the CEMP Penguin Monitoring Program (Colin Southwell, Barbara Wienecke) performed ground counts coordinated with the flying on two days. \nThe Flight lines were initially done on 2010/11/18 in bright sunlight, and then repeated on 2010/11/20 during overcast weather to compare the different image quality due to lack of shadows cast by the penguins.\nPriority 2 - Aerial photographic survey of the Svenner Group Islands\nFlights over Adelie Penguin colonies were performed at 750m, using 150mm lens, and then only over the islands known to host Adelie colonies.   \nFlying time total = 5 hours, 51 minutes\n\n- 2425\nThis task was to survey the Woop Woop Skiway, over an area of 320 square kilometres.  Due to time constraints, only every 2nd line was flown after consultation with AAD Air-operations (Steve Daw and Matt Filipowski).\nFlying time total = 4 hours 25 minutes\n\n- 3154\nThis task was to capture an aerial photograph of a Hawker Island Giant Petrel colony, being monitored by nest cameras. A run was conducted on 2010/11/19 in bright sunlight and also repeated on 2010/11/20 in flat light.\nFlying time total = 22 minutes\n\n- 3189\nThis task was to survey potential sites, in the Vestfold Hills near Davis, for a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty monitoring installation.\nFlying time total = 29 minutes",
