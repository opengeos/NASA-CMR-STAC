    "description": "Most large native carnivores have experienced range contractions due to\nconflicts with humans, although neither rates of spatial collapse nor expansion\nhave been well characterized.  In North America, the grizzly bear (Ursus\narctos) once ranged from Mexico northward to Alaska, however its range in the\ncontinental United States has been reduced by 95-98%.  Under the U.S.\nEndangered Species Act, the Yellowstone grizzly bear population has\nre-colonized habitats outside Yellowstone National Park.  We analyzed\nhistorical and current records, including data on radio-collared bears, (i) to\nevaluate changes in grizzly bear distribution in the southern Greater\nYellowstone Ecosystem over a 100-year period, (ii) to utilise historical rates\nof recolonization to project future expansion trends and (iii) to evaluate the\nreality of future expansion based on human limitations and land use.  Analysis\nof distribution in 20-year increments reflects range reduction from south to\nnorth (1900-1940) and expansion to the south (1940-2000).  Expansion was\nexponential and the area occupied by grizzly bears doubled approximately every\n20 years.  A complementary analysis of bear occurrence in Grand Teton National\nPark also suggests an unprecedented period of rapid expansion during the last\n20-30 years.  The grizzly bear population currently has re-occupied  about 50%\nof the southern GYE. Based on assumptions of continued protection and\necological stasis, our model suggests total occupancy in 25 years. \nAlternatively, extrapolation of linear expansion rates from the period prior to\nprotection suggests total occupancy could take > 100 years.  Analyses of\nhistorical trends can be useful as a restoration tool because they enable a\nframework and timeline to be constructed to pre-emptively address the social\nchallenges affecting future carnivore recovery.\n\nOne of the purposes of the dataset is to predict when grizzly bear occupation\nof Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem will be total.\n\nWe focused on a 24,000 square kilometer mosaic of mostly public land that is\nmanaged by various federal and state agencies.  Our analysis of changes in\ngrizzly bear distribution during 1900-2000 was divided into 20-year periods. \nFor each, we used various data sources for grizzly bear occurrence to create\ndigital maps of bear distribution using ArcView GIS 32. (ESRI, Redlands, CA) \nWe digitized reports, interviews, conflicts, mortalities and observations as\npoints.  We created a polygon for the 1920 source data, a hand-drawn\ndistribution map by Merriam (1922). More methodology given in Pyare, 2004\npaper.",
