    "description": "The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) is the successor to ENVISAT's Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) having additional spectral channels, different camera arrangements and simplified on-board processing. The OLCI is a push-broom instrument with five camera modules sharing the field of view. The field of view of the five cameras is arranged in a fan-shaped configuration in the vertical plane, perpendicular to the platform velocity. Each camera has an individual field of view of 14.2\u00b0 and a 0.6\u00b0 overlap with its neighbors. The whole field of view is shifted across track by 12.6\u00b0 away from the sun to minimize the impact of sun glint. OLCI is equipped with on-board calibration hardware based on sun diffusers. There are three sun diffusers--two 'white' diffusers dedicated to radiometric calibration and one dedicated to spectral calibration, with spectral reflectance features. The native resolution is approximately 300m, refered to as Full Resolution (FR). A Reduced Resolution (RR) processing mode provides Level-1B data at sampling rates decreased by a factor of four in both spatial dimensions resulting to resolution of approximately 1.2 km. ",
