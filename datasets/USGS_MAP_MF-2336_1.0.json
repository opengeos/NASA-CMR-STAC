    "description": "This database and accompanying plot files depict the distribution of geologic\nmaterials and structures at a regional (1:100,000) scale.  The report is\nintended to provide geologic information for the regional study of materials\nproperties, earthquake shaking, landslide potential, mineral hazards, seismic\nvelocity, and earthquake faults.  In addition, the report contains new\ninformation and interpretations about the regional geologic history and\nframework.  However, the regional scale of this report does not provide\nsufficient detail for site development purposes.  In addition, this map does\nnot take the place of fault-rupture hazard zones designated by the California\nState Geologist (Hart and Bryant, 1997).  Similarly, the database cannot be\nused to identify or delineate landslides in the region.\n\nThis digital map database, compiled from previously published and unpublished\ndata, and new mapping by the authors, represents the general distribution of\nbedrock and surficial deposits in the mapped area.  Together with the\naccompanying text file (ceghmf.ps, ceghmf.pdf, ceghmf.txt), it provides current\ninformation on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the area covered. \nThe database delineates map units that are identified by general age and\nlithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution (scale) of\nthe database to 1:100,000 or smaller.\n\nThis is the pre-release version of the report.  The accompanying text file\nmf2336.rev contains version numbers for each part of the data set.\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (Arc/ Info\ncoverages) and supporting text and plotfiles.  In addition, the report includes\ntwo sets of plotfiles (PostScript and PDF format) that will generate map sheets\nand pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field Studies Report.\n These files are described in the explanatory pamphlets (ceghdesc and ceghdb).\nThe base map layer used in the preparation of the geologic map plotfiles was\ndownloaded from the web (www.gisdatadepot.com) as Digital Raster Graphic files\nof scale-stable versions of the USGS 1:100,000 topographic maps and coverted to\nTIFF images which were then converted to GRIDs.  These grids contain no\ndatabase information other than position, and are included for reference only. \nThe base maps used were the Cape Mendocino (1989 edition), Eureka (1987\nedition), Garberville (1979 edition), Hayfork (1978 edition) 1:100,000\ntopographic maps, which all have a 50-meter contour interval.  The bathymetry\nmaps were converted from the Coast and Geodetic Survey hydrographic chart 1308\nN-12, 1969.",
