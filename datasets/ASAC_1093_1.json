    "description": "This project was a continuation of ASAC project 870 (ASAC_870).\n\nThe aim of the project is to assess the possible routes for the carriage of microorganisms by humans to Antarctic soil habitats. Such pathways include footwear, vehicle treads and washings of root vegetables.  These have been examined and measures have already been implemented to minimise further risk from these sources. A further aim was to determine the likelihood of foreign microorganisms successfully competing with indigenous terrestrial antarctic microorganisms; this has proved more difficult to ascertain under simulated antarctic conditions. Work is continuing on this aspect.\n\nThe danger posed by microbial contaminants on expeditioners' boots to antarctic wildlife habitats has been assessed, with the finding that bacterial spores would survive current walk-through disinfection procedures using 2% Virkon or 3%-chlorine bleach, although coliforms would not.  The problem of spore-survival in sanitizing solutions is exacerbated by residual clay in boot treads.  It is recommended that boots be scrubbed clean of residual soil or clay before entering antarctic waters, and again as necessary between geographically isolated areas within Antarctica. Soaking for four hours in 2.0% Virkon  or for 11 minutes in 3% chlorine bleach is needed for a 3-log reduction in Bacillus spore numbers.\n\nResults:\nThe following Decimal Reduction Times (DRTs) were obtained:\nB. subtilis, 80 and 84 minutes in 2% Virkon , 3.6 min in 3%-chlorine bleach.\nB. polymyxa, 32 minutes in 2% Virkon , 3.0 min in 3%-chlorine bleach.\nVegetative cells of E. coli died very rapidly in both Virkon  and 3%-chlorine bleach, with DRTs being less than 18 seconds, the limit of detection using the described method.",
