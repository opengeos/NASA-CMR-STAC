    "description": "The recruitment of epifauna (sessile and mobile) on hard-substratum was examined in a field experiment using tiles. A total of 160 tiles were deployed at five locations, with 32 tiles at each location, arranged in a spatially nested design. There were three potentially impacted locations locations (two in Brown Bay and one in Shannon Bay) and two control locations (in O'Brien Bay).\n\nThis metadata record describes data from the first sampling time only. Eight tiles were collected from each location 15 months after the initial deployment. The experiment was setup so that recruitment of sessile epifauna to both the upper and lower sides of the tiles could be examined. The mobile epifauna on the tiles were also collected and are described in a separate metadata record.\n\nHeavy recruitment was observed on the underside of the tile and only light recruitment was observed on the upper surface.\n\nAlso links to ASAC 1100.",
