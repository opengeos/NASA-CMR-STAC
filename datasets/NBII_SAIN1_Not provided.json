    "description": "This data set represents efforts to relocate a set of transects and plots that\nwere originally installed in 1987 and 1988 on the grassy balds complex of the\nRoan Mountain Massif [Round Bald, Engine Gap, Jane Bald, Grassy Ridge, Big\nYellow Mountain (also known as Yellow Mountain), Little Hump Mountain, Bradley\nGap, and Hump Mountain (also known as Big Hump Mountain)]. Data collected from\nthe transects and plots were to characterize baseline conditions against which\nthe effects of future vegetation management actions could be evaluated. \n\nThis legacy data set contains information on an effort conducted in 1996 to\nrelocate and re-monument (in the field) a series of transects and plots that\nwere originally installed in 1987 and 1988. This 1996 relocation was the second\nattempt to relocate the original 1987 and 1988 transects and plots.\n\nInformation for this legacy dataset comes from the following sources: one\nreport that describes the field efforts and inventories the GPS data, notes on\nthe location of transects, three spatial files that contain GPS data, and\ninterviews with the originators of the transect and plot data.\n\nThis metadata record documents geospatial legacy data to the extent\npracticable, as required by Executive Order 12906, \"Coordinating Geographic\nData Acquisition and Access: The National Spatial Data Infrastructure,\" dated\nApril 11, 1994.  Details may be missing, but given the resources available, the\ninformation provided herein is as concise as possible at this point in time.",
