    "description": "The Equatorial Pacific Process Study (EQPAC) was conducted along 140 deg W\n            longitude during 1992.\n            \n            Four cruises took place: February 3 - March 9, March 19 - April 15,\n            August 5 - September 18, and September 24 - October 21.  A fifth benthic\n            cruise and sediment trap legs were added.  During the first cruise\n            (TT007), 15 stations were occupied along 140 deg W longitude from\n            12 deg N latitude to 12 deg S latitude.  During the second cruise\n            (TT008), data were collected at 8 stations along 140 deg W longitude\n            from 9 deg S latitude to 9 deg N latitude.  During the third cruise\n            (TT011), data were collected at 15 stations along 140 deg W from 12 deg N\n            latitude to 12 deg S latitude.  During the fourth cruise (TT012), data were\n            collected at 5 stations along 140 deg W longitude from 17 deg S\n            latitude to the equator.\n            \n            On the second cruise, a camera and strobelights were used to\n            illuminate aggregate particles.  The system was lowered slowly\n            10-20 m/min through the water column on a trawl wire, exposing frames\n            at a time interval of 7-20 sec calculated to yield 700-800 frames\n            between the surface and the sea floor.  Depth was monitored and\n            recorded using a pinger and the ship's precision depth recorder.\n            The parameter measured was the number of aggregates greater than 0.5 mm.\n            \n            The data is public domain and can be retrieved on-line at\n            \"http://usjgofs.whoi.edu/jg/dir/jgofs/\"\n            \n            [The information in this summary was taken from the JGOFS\n            World Wide Web pages.]",
