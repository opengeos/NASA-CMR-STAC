    "description": "GCOM-W/AMSR2 L2 Sea Surface Wind Speed dataset is obtained from the AMSR2 sensor onboard GCOM-W and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).   GCOM-W was launched by the H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 21 (H-IIA F21) at 1:39 a.m. on May 18th, 2012 (Japan Standard Time, JST) and inserted into a planned position on the \"A-Train\" orbit. GCOM-W equipped with AMSR2 takes measurements at multiple microwave frequencies and multiple polarizations of weak electromagnetic waves in the microwave band radiated from the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface and the atmosphere. AMSR2 has swath of 1450 km and 7 microwave bands. The observation data will enable the creation of long-term trustworthy data sets of global physical amount. Level 2 products calculates various geophysical parameters related to water using the Level 1B or 1R products as inputs. This dataset includes Sea Surface Wind Speed (SSW). Coverage of the product is over the ocean only, and unit is [m/s]. Microwave radiometer can observe wind speed under the clouds, but it is difficult to estimate where there is rainfall and will be missing value. Wind speed around tropical cyclones, however, is important parameter in weather forecast, and we provide research product, which includes wind speed in rainy area over the ocean, as all-weather wind speed research product. The Pixel_Data_Quality is quality flag stored for each observation point. The provided format is HDF5. The Sampling resolution is 15 km. The current version of the product is Version 4. The Version 3 is also available. The generation unit is scene (defined as a half orbit).",
