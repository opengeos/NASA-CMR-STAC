    "description": "Atmospheric and oceanic methane in the marine boundary layer was monitored from 2010 December 20 to 2011 January 22 by the GC 7890A along the cruise track of R/V Araon from the King Sejong Station to Christchurch(New Zealand) carrying out a series of expeditions in The Amundsen Sea. The air inlet to the instrument was located at 29 m asl and the sea water inlet was located at 7m depth. CH4 was measured every 40 minutes.\nAs atmospheric methane is one of the major green house gases, it is important to understand the degree of influence of it. Although oceanic source doesn't contribute highly, it is required to monitor air-sea flux continuously because the area of the Ocean is large and the flux changes easily according to the chemical and biological conditions.",
