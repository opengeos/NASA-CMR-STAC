    "description": "Diatom data from IN2017_V01:\n\nThese data were generated by Amy Leventer (aleventer@colgate.edu) and undergraduate students at Colgate University, including Isabel Dove, Meghan Duffy, and Meaghan Kendall. All questions regarding the specifics of these data should be directed to Amy Leventer. These data are based on samples collected during research cruise IN2017_V01 of the RV Investigator, co-chief scientists, Leanne Armand and Phil O\u2019Brien. \n\nThe IN2017-V01post-cruise report is available through open access via the e-document portal through the ANU library. \n \nhttps://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/142525\n \nThe document DOI: \n\t10.4225/13/5acea64c48693\n\n \nThe preferred citation is: \n \nL.K. Armand, P.E. O\u2019Brien and On-board Scientific Party. 2018. Interactions of the Totten Glacier with the Southern Ocean through multiple glacial cycles (IN2017-V01): Post-survey report, Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra, http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/13/5acea64c48693\n\n\nSamples for diatom analysis were collected on board ship immediately after core recovery. Samples were dried in an oven at 50 degrees C prior to analytical work. Quantitative diatom slides were prepared according to the settling technique of Warnock and Scherer (2014). Cover slips were adhered to the slides using Norland Optical Adhesive #61. Slides were observed under Olympus CX31, BX50 and BX60, and Zeiss Primo Star light microscopes, using a 100X oil immersion objective for a total magnification of 1000X. A minimum of 400 valves or 10 transects was counted for each slide, depending on the absolute diatom abundance. Interglacial samples were relatively diatom-rich, consequently counts of 400 specimens were possible. However, most glacial samples were diatom-poor, making it very difficult and time-consuming to count 400 specimens. Under these conditions, 10 transects were counted, as has been done in previous studies of sediments with very low diatom concentrations (Rebesco et al., 2014). Valves were only counted if greaster than 50% complete. Diatoms were identified to species level when possible (Crosta et al., 2005; Armand et al., 2005; Cefarelli et al., 2010). Occurrences of biostratigraphic markers were noted and tallied concurrently. Species were considered extinct when observed stratigraphically higher than extinction boundaries as identified by Cody et al. (2008).\n\nStation_core\t\tLongitude\tLatitude\t\n\nA005_KC02_PC01\t\t115.623\t-64.471\nA006_KC03\t\t115.043\t-64.463\nA042_KC14\t\t116.6403\t-64.5387\nC012_KC04_PC05\t119.3012\t-64.675\nC013_KC05\t\t119.0183\t-64.6538\nC015_KC06\t\t118.696\t-64.729\nC018_KC07\t\t118.498\t-64.401\nC020_KC08\t\t119.739\t-64.794\nC022_KC11\t\t120.049\t-65.1313\nC025_KC12_PC08\t\t120.8635\t-64.9538\nC038_KC13\t\t119.1035\t-64.4828\n\nArmand, L.K., X.
