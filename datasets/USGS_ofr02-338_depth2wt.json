    "description": "This dataset was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the\ndevelopment of the USGS Front Range Infrastructure Resources Project. This\ndataset was used in the creation of 1:50,000-scale hydrogeologic contour maps.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey developed this dataset as part of the Colorado Front\nRange Infrastructure Resources Project (FRIRP). One goal of the FRIRP was to\nprovide information on the availability of those hydrogeologic resources that\nare either critical to maintaining infrastructure along the northern Front\nRange or that may become less available because of urban expansion in the\nnorthern Front Range. This dataset extends from the Boulder-Jefferson County\nline on the south, to the middle of Larimer and Weld Counties on the North. On\nthe west, this dataset is bounded by the approximate mountain front of the\nFront Range of the Rocky Mountains; on the east, by an arbitrary north-south\nline extending through a point about 6.5 kilometers east of Greeley. This\ndigital geospatial dataset consists of depth-to-water (unsaturated-thickness)\ncontours that were generated from hydrogeologic data with Geographic\nInformation System (GIS) software.",
