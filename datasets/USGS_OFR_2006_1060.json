    "description": "Magnetotelluric data were acquired during October 2001 by the U.S. Geological\nSurvey (USGS) as part of a study to examine the structural nature of basins in\nthe transition zone between the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and the\nBasin and Range province of Nevada. Magnetotelluric (MT) geophysical studies\nassist the mapping of geologic structure and the inference of lithologic\npackages that are concealed beneath the Earth's surface.\n\nThe Basin and Range province has a complicated geologic history, which includes\nextension and compression of the Earth's crust to form the basins and ranges\nthat blanket much of Nevada. The basins and ranges in the vicinity of this\nstudy trend northeastward and are bounded by steeply dipping strike slip\nfaults. Interestingly, deep east-west magnetic trends occur in the aeromagnetic\ndata of this study area indicating that the northeast-trending basins and\nranges represent only thin-skinned deformation at the surface with an\nunderlying east-west structure. To investigate this issue, MT data were\nacquired at seven stations in eastern California, 20 km east of Mono Lake. The\npurpose of this report is to present a two-dimensional apparent resistivity\nmodel of the MT data acquired for this study.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
