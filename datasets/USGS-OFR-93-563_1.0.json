    "description": "The USGS Open-File Report 92-712 data set (Pliocene palynomorph census data\nfrom the Pinecrest Beds (Tamiami Formation) in Quality Aggregates Phase 6 pit,\nSouthwestern Florida) is a digital version of the original OFR 92-172 report.\nData on arboreal and non-arboreal pollen concentrations are included.  Core\ndata and derived data sets and programs are made availbale online via the Wide\nWeb:\n\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/of93-563/\"\n\nThe following information about the data set contents were provided by the data\ncenter contact:\n\nSamples weighing about 80 grams were collected for pollen preparation.\nSediments first  were screened through an 850 um mesh to remove shelly debris.\nThen, samples were decalcified using hydrochloric acid and demineralized using\nhydrofluoric acid.  The neutralized residue was suspended in a dilute detergent\nsolution to keep clay-sized particles in suspension and filtered through an 8\n5m nylon mesh to remove the clay- sized particles.  Organic and mineral matter\nthen were separated using a heavy-liquid flotation with zinc chloride (specific\ngravity =2.0).  Organic material was removed, washed, and stained with Bismarck\nBrown before being mixed with warm glycerine jelly and mounted on microscope\nslides.\n\nThis data set is a digital form of the original report, which can be obtained\nby\ncontacting the USGS Library.  Modifications to the structure and format of\nincluded digital files were made by Peter Schweitzer to conform to guidelines\nof the Global Change and Climate History Program.",
