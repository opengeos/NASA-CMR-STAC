    "description": "Total primary energy supply (TPES) is made up of production + imports - exports - international marine bunkers +/- stock changes. Combustible renewables and waste comprises solid biomass and animal products, gas/liquids from biomass, industrial waste and municipal waste. Biomass is defined as any plant matter used directly as fuel or converted into fuels (e.g. charcoal) or electricity and/or heat. Included here are wood, vegetal waste (including wood waste and crops used for energy production), ethanol, animal materials/wastes and sulphite lyes (Sulphite lyes are also known as \"black liquor\" and are an alkaline spent liquor from the digesters in the production of sulphate or soda pulp during the manufacture of paper. The energy is derived from the lignin removed from the wood pulp.). Municipal waste comprises wastes produced by the residential, commercial and public service sectors that are collected by local authorities for disposal in a central location for the production of heat and/or power. Hospital waste is included in this category.  Data under this heading are often based on small sample surveys or other incomplete information. Thus the data give only a broad impression of developments, and are not strictly comparable between countries. In some cases complete categories of vegetal fuel are omitted due to lack of information. It is therefor important to refer to the data of the individual country when consulting the regional aggregation. A KTOE is defined as 41.868 TJ (Terajoules) or 11.630 GWh (Gigawatt-Hour).\n",
