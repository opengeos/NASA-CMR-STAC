    "description": "Metadata record for data expected from ASAC Project 2647\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n      \nThis project required that water sampling be conducted at the deep point in Ace, Pendant and Ekho Lakes.  Detailed surveys were conducted over the deeper sections of each lake and the deep point located.\n\nSurveys were completed between May and July 2006.  In each case a grid was laid out on each lake marked with 2m bamboo poles.  The grid was based on the standard metric map grid and established with a handheld GPS.  It therefore contains the typical x-y error (+ or - 15 m) inherent in all GPS data where a differential correction has not been applied.  \n\nNo contouring software was available, so a demo version of SURFER was downloaded.  The demo version does not allow saving files or printing so the 'maps' are screen dumps saved as .jpg files.  The raw data are also available in the attached Excel spreadsheet.\n\nFinally, during August 2006 the lake water surface (again piezometric height of the water in a fully penetrating drill hole) was tied to bench marks and the water surface elevation reduced relative to the Davis MSL.\n\n(1983) datum as follows:\n\nAce Lake - 9.094 m  (tied to NMV/S/75)\nPendant Lake - 3.029 m (tied to NMV/S/43)\nEkho Lake - -1.649 m (tied to NMV/s/24)",
