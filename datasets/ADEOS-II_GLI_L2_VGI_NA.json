    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L2 Vegetation Indices is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km. This product includes the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) which is the ratio between the difference in the red and near- infrared and their sum the most widely used index in global vegetation studies and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for increased sensitivity over a wider range of vegetation conditions, removal of soil background influences, and removal of residual atmospheric contamination effects present in the NDVI. They use L2_ACLC data as input. The GLI VI products will be spatially and temporally re-sampled, and designed to provide cloud free vegetation index maps at nominal resolutions of 1 km. The composited surface reflectance data from each pixel is used to compute both the NDVI and the EVI gridded products. The bands used to compute the VI are as follows: Red band: Band 13, BIR band: band 19, Blue band: band 5. The gridded VIs is produced at 16-day (half- month) also Monthly gridded VI products based on temporal averaging of the 16 days products is available. The provided format is HDF. The physical quantity unit is dimensionless. Map projection is EQR and PS. Generation unit is zone. The spatial resolution is 0.25 degree and the statistical period is 16 days. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
