    "description": "NOTE - this record has been superseded by \"SIC_266_267_ortho\", which describes a more recent orthorectification of the same two images.\n\nTwo IKONOS 2004 images (SIC 266 and 267) were chosen as the base images for the AAS2939 change detection project. The reason for choosing these images where that they were the earliest very high resolution (VHR) image with the least amount of cloud cover for which DGPS GCPs are available and identified on the image by Jenny Scott. The importance of having a base image to register all other images to is to allow change detection between images.\nThe 2004 IKONOS image was resampled to a 0.6m resolution, in order to match the resolution of the Quickbird images (for future rectification and change detection).",
