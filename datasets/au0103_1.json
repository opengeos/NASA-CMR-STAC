    "description": "Oceanographic measurements were conducted along CLIVAR Southern Ocean meridional repeat transect SR3 between Tasmania and Antarctica from October to December 2001. A total of 135 CTD vertical profile stations were taken, more than half to within 20 m of the bottom. Over 2200 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, CFC's, CCl4, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, 13C, DMS/DMSP/DMSO, halocarbons, barium, barite, ammonia, del30Si, dissolved and particulate organic carbon, particulate silica, 15N-nitrate, 18O, 234Th, 230Th, 231Pa, primary productivity and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Near surface current data were collected using a ship mounted ADCP. Two sediment trap moorings were serviced, and a third mooring was deployed at a new location. A summary of all CTD data and data quality is presented in the data report.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 1335.",
