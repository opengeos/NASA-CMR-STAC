    "description": "Old data collected by Jared Pettersson, and found by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre.  Note, this metadata record has not been produced by the scientist in question, but by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre.  Therefore we cannot guarantee its quality.\n\nThe information below has been copied from word documents found within the dataset:\n\nSummary of work done by Jared Pettersson on Casey - Old Casey road GPR survey.\n\n- Established goals of survey\no To image bedrock height and confirm if old Casey is situated on an island or a peninsula\no Gain as much information about the subsurface to try and give insights into the movement/location of road material placed in previous years\no Bring data together to make it useful for operations to make any decisions for alternative road options.\n\n- Reviewed work done by Eva Papp and extract any useful information from her work.\n- Locate all GPR lines and import into Gradix processing software.\n- Due to the inconsistency between surveyed length of GPR lines and that recorded by the GPR, length corrections had to be made.\n- Process GPR profiles for bedrock interface and internal layering (see paper for details)\n- Extract information from the profiles, ie depth to bedrock.\n- Convert these data points (distance along profile and depth to layer boundary) to a format for input to a GIS system.\n-Construct 3D model in Surfer for visualization to aid in interpretation and provide a simple way of displaying extracted data. Write sections in proposed paper, ie survey details, data processing and some interpretation.\n\nSummary of work done by Jared Pettersson on Loken Moraine GPR survey.\n\n- Established goals of survey\no To image bedrock height, basal debris layer, internal ice structure and any features that may allude to the moraines development\no Produce a paper on the use of GPR for investigating moraine structure/development\n\n- Reviewed work done by Eva Papp and extract any useful information from her work.\n- Locate all GPR lines and import into Gradix processing software.\n- Process GPR profiles for bedrock interface and internal layering (see paper for details)\n- Travelled to Newcastle to meet with Ian Goodwin to discuss the paper and work through data. Discussed future plans for the ITASE traverse, and ran through operation of GPR with Ian.\n- Write sections in proposed paper, ie survey details, data processing and some interpretation.\n- Produced preliminary graphics for paper (GPR profiles and location maps)\n\n\nSummary of work done by Jared Pettersson on the Wilkes GPR survey.\n\n- Goals of survey\no Establish if tip extents could be imaged by GPR as well as any possible volume calculations of the tip material\no Map any cultural features in the subsurface (buildings, barrels etc) to aid in future waste management plans.\no Integrate GPR data into a GIS system.\n\n- Reviewed work done by Eva Papp and extract any useful information from her work.\n- Locate all GPR lines and import into Gradix processing software.\n- Process GPR profiles for bedrock interface and internal layering (see paper for details)\n- Extract information from the profiles, ie lateral extents of tip/buildings and buried debris.\n- Convert these data points (distance along profile and depth to layer boundary) to a format suitable for input to a GIS system.\n- Write sections in proposed paper, ie survey details, data processing and some interpretation.",
