    "description": "Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is a masting species that produces relatively\nlarge, fat- and protein-rich nuts that are consumed by grizzly bears (Ursus\narctos horribilis).  Trees produce abundant nut crops in some years and poor\ncrops in other years.  Grizzly bear survivial in the Greater Yellowstone\nEcosystem is strongly linked to variation in pine-nut availability.  Because\nwhitebark pine trees are infected with blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), an\nexotic fungus that has killed the species throughout much of its range in the\nnorthern Rocky Mountains, we used stable isotopes to quantify the importance of\nthis food resource to Yellowstone grizzly bears while healthy populations of\nthe trees still exist.  Whitebark pine nuts have a sulfur-isotope signature\nthat is distinctly different from those of all other grizzly bear foods. \nFeeding trials with captive grizzly bears were used to develop relationships\nbetween dietary sulfur-, carbon-, and nitrogen-isotope signatures and those of\nbear plasma.\n\nThe sulfur and nitrogen relationships were used to estimate the importance of\npine nuts to free-rangin grizzly bears from blood and hair samples collected\nbetween 1994 and 2001.  During years of abundant cone availability,\napproximately 8+ or - 10% of the bears made minimal use of pine nuts, while 67\n+ or - 19% derived over 51% of their assimilated sulfur and nitrogen (i.e.,\nprotein) from pine nuts.  Pine nuts and meat are two critically important food\nresources for Yellowstone grizzly bears.\n\nThe GYE includes Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks and adjacent\nfederal, state, and private lands in portions of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. \nThe GYE contains the headwaters of three major continental-scale river systems:\nthe Missouri and the Mississippi, Snake and Columbia, and Green and Colorado.\n\nMajor plant and animal foods consumed by grizzly bears (Mattson et al., 1991)\nwere collected through the GYE to determine if whitebark pine nuts have a\nunique isotopic signature relative to other foods.  Plant samples were\ncollected at sites used by radio-collared grizzly bears and included whitebark\npine nuts; the foliage of clover (Trifolium spp.), horsetails (Equisetum\narvense), elk thistle (Cirsium scariosum), cow parsnip (Heracleum lanatum),\ndandelion  (Taraxacum spp.) , spring beauty (Claytonia lanceolata), sedges\n(Carex raynoldsii and C. Praticola), and grasses (Bromus anomolous), Phleum\nalpinum, Agropyron caninum, Poa spp. And Festuca idahoensis); and the bulbs or\nroots of onion grass  (Melica spectabilis) , biscuitroot (Lomatium spp.),  and\nyampa (Perideridia gairdneri) .  Fleshy fruits or berries are not significant\ngrizzly bear foods in the GYE and therefore were not collected (Mealey 1975;\nKendall 1983; Mattson et al 1991).  Collected animal matter included army\ncutworm moths (Euxoa auxiliaris)  at alpine aggregation sites, cutthroat trout\n(Onchorhyncus clarki) in spawning streams around Yellowstone Lake, and bison\n(Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus) , and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus ) from\nthroughout the park where they had been killed in collisions with cars.",
