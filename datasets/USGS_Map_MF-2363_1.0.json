    "description": "To update and reinterpret earlier geologic mapping, and provide sufficient\ngeologic information for land-use decisions for private land and for areas\nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service.  Use of\nthese data at scales greater than 1:24,000 would be inappropriate because\nmapping was performed at that scale.\n\nThis 1:24,000-scale geologic map of the Grand Junction 7.5' quadrangle, in\nsupport of the USGS Western Colorado I-70 Corridor Cooperative Geologic Mapping\nProject, provides new interpretations of the stratigraphy, structure, and\ngeologic hazards in the area of the junction of the Colorado River and the\nGunnison River.  Bedrock strata include the Upper Cretaceous Mancos Shale\nthrough the Lower Jurassic Wingate Sandstone units. Below the Mancos Shale,\nwhich floors the Grand Valley, the Upper and Lower(?)Cretaceous Dakota\nFormation and the Lower Cretaceous Burro Canyon Formation hold up much of the\nresistant northeast- dipping monocline along the northeast side of the\nUncompahgre uplift.  The impressive sequence of Jurassic strata below include\nthe Brushy Basin, Salt Wash, and Tidwell Members of the Upper Jurassic Morrison\nFormation, the Middle Jurassic Wanakah Formation and informal \"board beds\" unit\nand Slick Rock Member of the Entrada Formation, and the Lower Jurassic Kayenta\nFormation and Wingate Sandstone.  The Upper Triassic Chinle Formation and Early\nProterozoic meta-igneous gneiss and migmatitic meta- sedimentary rocks, which\nare exposed in the Colorado National Monument quadrangle to the west, do not\ncrop out here.  The monoclinal dip slope of the northeastern margin of the\nUncompahgre uplift is apparently a Laramide structural feature.  Unlike the\nsouthwest-dipping, high-angle reverse faults in the Proterozoic basement and\ns-shaped fault- propagation folds in the overlying strata found in the Colorado\nNational Monument 7.5' quadrangle along the front of the uplift to the west,\nthe monocline in the map area is unbroken except at two localities.  One\nlocality displays a small asymmetrical graben that drops strata to the\nsouthwest.  This faulted character of the structure dies out to the northwest\ninto an asymmetric fault-propagation fold that also drops strata to the\nsouthwest.  Probably both parts of this structure are underlain by a\nnortheast-dipping high-angle reverse fault.  The other locality displays a\nsecond similar asymmetric fold.  No evidence of post-Laramide tilting or uplift\nexists here, but the antecedent Unaweep Canyon, only 30 km to the\nsouth-southwest of the map area, provides clear evidence of Late Cenozoic, if\nnot Pleistocene, uplift. The major geologic hazards in the area include large\nlandslides associated with the dip-slope-underlain, smectite-rich Brushy Basin\nMember of the Morrison Formation and overlying Dakota and Burro Canyon\nFormations.  Active landslides affect the southern bank of the Colorado River\nwhere undercutting by the river and smectitic clays in the Mancos trigger\nlandslides.  The Wanakah, Morrison, and Dakota Formations and the Mancos Shale\ncreate a significant hazard to houses and other structures by containing\nexpansive smectitic clay.  In addition to seasonal spring floods associated\nwith the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers, a serious flash flood hazard associated\nwith sudden summer thunderstorms threatens the intermittent washes that drain\nthe dip slope of the monocline.\n\nAlthough this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata file is\nintended to document the data set in nonproprietary form, as well as in\nARC/INFO format, this metadata file may include some ARC/INFO-specific\nterminology.\n\nGeospatial data files of this data set:\n>  gj24k: geology polygons, contacts, faults\n>  gjpnt: point data representing bedding attitudes\n>  gjline: line representing location of the cross section,\n>          and fold axes\n\nSymbolsets used for plotting in ArcInfo:\n>  wpgcmykg.shd: shadeset\n>  geol_sfo.lin: lineset\n>  geoscamp1.mrk: markerset",
