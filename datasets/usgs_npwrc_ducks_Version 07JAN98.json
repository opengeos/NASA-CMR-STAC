    "description": "Waterfowl inventories taken during the breeding season are recognized\nas a basic technique in assessing the number of ducks per unit\narea. That waterfowl censusing is still an inexact technology leading\nto divergent interpretations of results is also recognized. The\ninexactness stems from a wide spectrum of factors that include\nweather, breeding phenology, asynchronous nesting periods, vegetative\ngrowth, species present and their daily activity, previous field\nexperience of personnel, plus others (Stewart et al., 1958; Diem and\nLu, 1960; Crissey, 1963a). In spite of the possible errors, accurate\nestimates are necessary to our understanding of production rates of\nall North American breeding waterfowl. Statistically adequate censuses\nof breeding pairs and accurate predictions of young produced per pair\nstill remain as two of the primary statistics in determining yearly\nrecruitment rate of species breeding in particular units of pond\nhabitats. Without precise breeding pair and production data, the\nproblems involved in describing the reproductive potential of any\nspecies and its environmental or density-dependent limiting factors\ncannot be adequately resolved.\n\nThe purposes of this paper are to (1) describe methods used to\nestimate yearly breeding pair abundance on two study areas, one in\nManitoba and the other in Saskatchewan; (2) assess the relative\nconsistency, precision, and accuracy of pair counts as related to the\nbreeding biology of duck species; and (3) recommend census methods\nthat can more closely approximate absolute populations breeding in\nparkland and grassland habitats.",
