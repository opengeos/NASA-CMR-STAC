    "description": "The Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) and the Solar Wind\n      Ion Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS) on ACE are instruments optimized for\n      measurements of the chemical and isotopic composition of solar and\n      interstellar matter. SWICS determines uniquely the chemical and\n      ionic-charge composition of the solar wind, the temperatures and mean\n      speeds of all major solar-wind ions, from H through Fe, at all solar\n      wind speeds above 300 km/s (protons) and 170 km/s (Fe+16), and\n      resolves H and He isotopes of both solar and interstellar\n      sources. SWICS will measure the distribution functions of both the\n      interstellar cloud and dust cloud pickup ions up to energies of 100\n      keV/e. SWIMS will measure the chemical and isotopic and charge state\n      composition of the solar wind for every element between He and\n      Ni. Each of the two instruments uses electrostatic analysis followed\n      by a time-of-flight and, as required, an energy measurement. The\n      observations made with SWICS and SWIMS will make valuable\n      contributions to the ISTP objectives by providing information\n      regarding the composition and energy distribution of matter entering\n      the magnetosphere.\n      \n      SWICS level 2 data is organized into 27-day time periods (Bartels\n      Rotations - roughly one solar rotation period). For each Bartels\n      Rotation, the level 2 data contains time averages of solar wind\n      parameters over the following time periods:\n      \n      - hourly\n      - daily\n      - 27 days (1 Bartels rotation)\n      \n      SWICS level 2 data consists of the following solar wind data items:\n      \n      - Bulk and Thermal ion Speeds (km/s) => H+, He+2, O+6, Mg+10, and Fe+11\n      \n      - Ratio of Elements => 4He+2/O, 20Ne+8/O, 24Mg+10/O, and 56Fe+(7 to 12)/O\n      \n      - Ratio of Charge States of the Same Element => C+5/C+6, O+7/O+6, and Fe+11/Fe+9\n      \n      - Isotope ratios => 3He/4He, 22Ne/20Ne, 24Mg/26Mg\n         \n         See:\n         http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/swics_swims_l2desc.html",
