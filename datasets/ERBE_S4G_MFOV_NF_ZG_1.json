    "description": "ERBE_S4G_MFOV_NF_ZG_1 is the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) S-4G Non-scanner, Medium Field of View (MFOV) Numerical Filter (NF) Zonal and Global Averages in HDF data product. Data collection for this product is complete. It consists of non-scanner, medium field-of-view data, processed using the numerical filter data reduction technique. The data are averaged over latitudinal bands(zones) as well as on a global level in which each parameter is averaged over the entire globe. The zonal averages are available in both 5.0 and 10.0 degree resolutions. Monthly (day), monthly (hour), daily, and monthly hourly averages are determined for each region. The data are represented as 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integers.\r\n\r\nERBE is a multi-satellite system that was designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget. ERBE instruments flew on a mid-inclination National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, NOAA-9 and NOAA-10. NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 provided global coverage and the ERBS provided coverage between 67.5 degrees north and south latitude. Each satellite carried both a scanner and a non-scanner instrument package. The non-scanner instrument contained four Earth-viewing channels and a solar monitor. The Earth-viewing channels had two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth, and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter. The former were called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium field of view (MFOV) channels. For each of the two fields of view, there was a total spectral channel which was sensitive to all wavelengths and a shortwave channel which used a high purity, fused silica filter dome to transmit only the shortwave radiation from 0.2 to 5 microns. Because of the concern for spectral flatness and high accuracy, all five channels on the non-scanner package were active cavity radiometers. The ERBE S-4G product contained averages of radiant flux and albedo on regional, zonal, and global scales. The data for the S-4G product were arranged by parameter values. ERBE S-4G MFOV product was available as a combination of the ERBS and NOAA-9 spacecraft. Products were archived as a combination of ERBS and NOAA-9 from February 1985 through October 1986. MFOV measurements from NOAA-10 have not been archived.",
