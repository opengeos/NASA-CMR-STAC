Ezequiel\nFern\u00e1ndez.\n\nThe present project raises the accomplishment of an archaeological\ninvestigation in the Peninsula of Fildes. The low population density, the\nisolation conditions, the extreme colds, have turned to the Shetland of the\nSouth in a reserve not only of fauna and flora but also of the material culture\nof their inhabitants. All of this items turn to the island King George and to\nthe Peninsula of Fildes more indeed into an excellent place for the\naccomplishment of archaeological investigations. \n\nMoreover, the fact that many of their old inhabitants arrived as shipwrecked\ngrants to the investigation of the archaeological vestiges another point of\ninterest, as it is the visualization through the material culture of human\nbehavior in extreme situations. Also, the fact that our investigations will\ntake place in a protected area forces to us to design a particular \nmethodological and technical plan where the archaeological work is centered\nfundamentally in the referencing, registry, mapping and protection of the\nlocated archaeological vestiges. We pretend by this way to develop a\nnon-intrusive archaeology, which does not generate alterations to such a\nsensible ecosystem to the action of exogenous agents - man including - as it is\nit the King George Island. In that sense, we will work with a reduce staff,\nwith no more than four members and we won't do any excavation.\n\nWhat refers to material culture we must say that we will take from the field\njust the objects that we consider fundamental for the interpretation, in case\nit is extremely necessary and only if it doesn't alter the fauna and flora.  In\nall the cases they will be samples of small dimensions, that do not jeopardize\nthe structure of the found rest. Previously they will be referenced by means of\nthe use of GPS and in detail registered, posteriori they will be analyzed in\nthe BCAA.  We will only transferred to Montevideo the objects on which specific\nanalyses are due to make. \n\nThe environmental impact caused by the development of this modality of\nnon-intrusive archaeology, will be less than minimum.  The final product of\nthis investigation will be the analysis and interpretation of the\narchaeological data and the preparation of chart in which the protected\narchaeological areas. We will put special emphasize in the vestiges of human\nactivity pre - Antarctic Treat.   The zone in which the prospection will be\ndevelop is defined to the north by limit SW of the Glacier Collins, and to the\nwest, east, and south by the coast of the Peninsula of Fildes.",
