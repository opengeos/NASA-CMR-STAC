    "description": "This digital geologic and tectonic database of the Death Valley ground-water\nmodel area, as well as its accompanying geophysical maps, are compiled at\n1:250,000 scale.  The map compilation presents new polygon, line, and point\nvector data for the Death Valley region.  The map area is enclosed within a 3\ndegree X 3 degree area along the border of southern Nevada and southeastern\nCalifornia.  In addition to the Death Valley National Park and Death\nValley-Furnace Creek fault systems, the map area includes the Nevada Test Site,\nthe southwest Nevada volcanic field, the southern end of the Walker Lane (from\nsouthern Esmeralda County, Nevada, to the Las Vegas Valley shear zone and\nStateline fault system in Clark County, Nevada), the eastern California shear\nzone (in the Cottonwood and Panamint Mountains), the eastern end of the Garlock\nfault zone (Avawatz Mountains), and the southern basin and range (central Nye\nand western Lincoln Counties, Nevada).  This geologic map improves on previous\ngeologic mapping in the area by providing new and updated Quaternary and\nbedrock geology, new interpretation of mapped faults and regional structures,\nnew geophysical interpretations of faults beneath the basins, and improved GIS\ncoverages.  The basic geologic database has tectonic interpretations imbedded\nwithin it through attributing of structure lines and unit polygons which\nemphasize significant and through-going structures and units.  An emphasis has\nbeen put on features which have important impacts on ground-water flow.\nConcurrent publications to this one include a new isostatic gravity map (Ponce\nand others, 2001), a new aeromagnetic map (Ponce and Blakely, 2001), and\ncontour map of depth to basement based on inversion of gravity data (Blakely\nand Ponce, 2001).\n\nThis map compilation was completed in support of the Death Valley Ground-Water\nBasin regional flow model funded by the Department of Energy in conjunction\nwith the U. S. Geological Survey and National Park Service.  The proposed model\nis intended to address issues concerning the availability of water in Death\nValley National Park and surrounding counties of Nevada and California and the\nmigration of contaminants off of the Nevada Test Site and Yucca Mountain\nhigh-level waste repository.  The geologic compilation and tectonic\ninterpretations contained within this database will serve as the basic\nframework for the flow model.  The database also represents a synthesis of many\nsources of data compiled over many years in this geologically and tectonically\nsignificant area.",
