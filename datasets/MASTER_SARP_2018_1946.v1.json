    "description": "This dataset includes Level 1B (L1B) data products from the MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) instrument collected and developed by the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). The spectral data were collected from flights flown on 2018-06-20 to 2018-06-28 over the Channel Islands and coastline near Santa Barbara, California, U.S., in a NASA ER-2 aircraft. SARP was an eight-week summer program for junior and senior undergraduate students to acquire hands-on research experience in all aspects of a scientific campaign using airborne science laboratories. The SARP 2018 deployment included two flights with 13 flight tracks. Data products include L1B georeferenced multispectral imagery of calibrated radiance in 50 bands covering wavelengths of 0.460 to 12.879 micrometers at approximately 50-meter spatial resolution, and the L1B file format is HDF-4. In addition, the dataset includes flight paths, spectral band information, instrument configuration, ancillary notes, and summary information for each flight, and browse images derived from each L1B data file.",
