    "description": "The OMPS-N20 NM PCA SO2 Step1 Total Column 1-Orbit L2 Swath 17x13km collection 1 product contains the retrieved sulfur dioxide (SO2) measured by the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) satellite. The product is based on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center principal component analysis (PCA) spectral fitting algorithm (Li et al., 2013, 2017) used to retrieve the SO2 total column amounts assuming different SO2 plume heights, including the boundary layer (lowest 1 km of the atmosphere), the lower (centered at 3 km), middle (centered at 8 km) and upper (centered at 13 km) troposphere, as well as the lower stratosphere (centered at 18 km).  Each granule contains data from the daylight portion for a single orbit or about 50 minutes. Spatial coverage is global (-90 to 90 degrees latitude), and there are about 14 orbits per day each with a swath width of 2600 km. There are 104 pixels in the cross-track direction before February 13, 2019 with a pixel resolution of about 17 km x 17 km at nadir. Since then, the pixel resolution has been enhanced to 17 km x 13 km at nadir, with 140 pixels in the cross-track direction. The files are written using netCDF version 4.  ",
