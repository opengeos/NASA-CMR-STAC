    "description": "Data for Crooked Lake and Lake Druzhby (CL and LD), Vestfold Hills.Programme Dec 98 - Feb 00\nPI: Prof J Laybourn-Parry\nWinterer: Tracey Henshaw (any questions regarding the data sheets:\nplxtlh@nottingham.ac.uk)\n\nFour sites were sampled in the two lakes\nCl  - 68 36 30 S 78 21 50 E\nLD1 - 68 35 47 S 78 14 56 E\nLD2 - 68 35 15 S 78 18 00 E\nLD3 - 68 35 40 S 78 19 20 E\n\nOriginally the sites were known by names;\nLD1 - Watts site\nLD2 - LDD or LD deep site\nLD3 - LDS or LD Shallow or LD Upper site\n\nFolders\nThere are four folders (Physical, Chemical, Biological and Production Data) each containing the relevant workbooks ie: ammonia, heterotrophic bacteria etc Within each workbook, each sites' data set is on a separate sheet (with any related graphs) with any special notes regarding that data set.\n\nNotes\nChemical Folder - all units are micrograms per litre\nPhysical folder - all units specified on the sheets.\nBiological Folder - Chl a is in micrograms per litre.\nSome microscopy samples were counted by Johanna Laybourn-Parry and so there are no data available for sizing or for heterotropic bacteria rods v cocci. These are mainly in Nov 99 and indicated on the sheet as 'JLP' and nd. CL does not contain cyanobacteria, so there are no entries for CL in the cyano workbook.\nPNAN and HNAN, ciliates and rotifers were sized once in Nov 99 to give a carbon pool snapshot. PNAN and HNAN sizing data are in the PNAN and HNAN workbook, ciliate and rotifer abndance and sizing is in the carbon pool workbook.\nTotal biomass data are also in the carbon pool workbook.\n\nProduction Folder - Bacterial production (ng C l-1h-1) raw data are given, calculations are to the left of the raw data and graphs at the bottom of the data.\nFractionation and Nutrient addition workbooks relate to work done separating the bacterial fraction into free and aggregate associated bacterial fractions and to spiking with nutrients and measuring production.\n\nGraphs\nMany of the graphs do not have labelled X axes (as decimal dating was used throughout) but dates are given with the data.\n\nSampling\nSites LD1 and LD3 were shallow sites, so samples were originally taken from 3 depths but this was reduced in June/July to two depths. Sites CL and LD2 are deep sites and samples were originally taken from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 m but this was reduced in Mar/May to 0, 2, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20 and 40m.\nSeveral sampling sites for LD1 and LD3 were tried at the start of the programme (denoted as 'old' or 1x 1a sites on the spreadsheets).\nIn January 00 only one sample from LD1 and LD3 was collected.\n\nSampling Dates\nSampling dates vary between the sites, but are given with each data set. There may appear to be discrepancies for example, LDS ammonia sampled on 21 Jan but DOC on 25 Jan - but sampling was broken down at the start while I learnt the technique\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nAmmonia concentration\nHeterotrophic bacteria\nCyanobacteria abundance\nCiliates\nRotifers\nnitrite\nnitrate\ntemperature\noxygen (O)\ncysts\nbiomass\nvolume\nPH\nconductivity\nlight data\nphosphorus concentrations\nsaturation\nconditions\nair temperature\nice thickness\nfactionation\nchlorophyll a isoclines\nstandard deviation\nmean\nconversion factor\ncarbon produced",
