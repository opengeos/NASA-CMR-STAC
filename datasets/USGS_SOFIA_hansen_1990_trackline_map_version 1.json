    "description": "The map shows the tracklines for bathymetric data collected between 1995 and 1999 for Florida Bay. The areas on the map are linked to the corresponding data sets which contain values for X (easting), Y (northing), Z (elevation), and the RMS computed from Ashtech PNAV software. The data set is labeled 1990 for easy comparison. The project duration was a decade.\n      \n      Detailed, high-resolution maps of Florida Bay mudbank elevations are needed to understand sediment dynamics and provide input into water quality and circulation models. The bathymetry of Florida Bay has not been systematically mapped in nearly 100 years, and some shallow areas of the bay have never been mapped. An accurate, modern bathymetric survey provides a baseline for assessing future sedimentation rates in the Bay, and a foundation for developing a sediment budget. Due to the complexity of the Bay and age of existing data, a current bathymetric grid (digitally derived from the survey) is critical for numerical models. Numerical circulation and sediment transport models being developed for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program are being used to address water quality issues in Florida Bay. Application of these models is complicated due to the complex seafloor topography (basin/mudbank morphology) of the Bay. The only complete topography data set of the Bay is 100 years old. Consequently, an accurate, modern seafloor bathymetry map of the Bay is critical for numerical modeling research. A modern bathymetry data set will also permit a comparison to historical data in order to help access sedimentation rates within the Bay. The objective of this research was to collect new bathymetry for all of Florida Bay, digitize the historical shoreline and bathymetric data, compare previous data to modern data, and produce maps and digital grids of historical and modern bathymetry.",
