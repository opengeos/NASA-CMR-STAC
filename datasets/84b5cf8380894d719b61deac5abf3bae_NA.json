    "description": "This dataset contains a time series of ice velocities for the Greenland margin from the PALSAR instrument on the ALOS satellite. It has been produced by the ESA Greenland Ice Sheet Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project.     This dataset consists of a time series of ice velocity with yearly sampling, derived from intensity tracking of PALSAR data acquired between 20-12-2016 and 17-03-2011.  It provides components of the ice velocity and the magnitude of the velocity. The data are provided on a polar stereographic grid (EPSG3413: Latitude of true scale 70N, Reference Longitude 45E).  The horizontal velocity is provided in true meters per day, towards the EASTING(x) and NORTHING(y) directions of the grid; the vertical displacement (z), derived from a digital elevation  model, is also provided.  Please note that the previous versions of this product provided the horizontal velocities as true East and North velocities.Both a single NetCDF file (including all measurements and annotation), and separate geotiff files with the velocity components are provided.  The product was generated by GEUS.  For further details, please consult the Product User Guide (v2.0)Please note - this product was released on the Greenland Ice Sheets download page in June 2016, but an earlier product (also accidentally labelled v1.1) was available through the CCI Open Data Portal and the CEDA archive until 29th November 2016.  Please now use the later v1.1 product.",
