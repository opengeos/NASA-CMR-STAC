    "description": "Interpretation of reprocessed data from a regional grid of 25 public-domain 2-D\nseismic profiles in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska has enabled an\nanalysis of subsurface geologic relations throughout that region. Notable\nresults include interpretations of the geometry of the Mississippian Umiat and\nMeade basins, and depositional patterns in the thick succession of younger\nstrata that were influenced by major structural features such as the Barrow\narch and the Brooks Range.\n\nPre-Mississippian low-grade metamorphic rocks and subordinate granites of the\nFranklinian sequence are the basement rocks of the region. The top of the\nFranklinian is imaged as one of the highest amplitude, most continuous\nreflections.\n\nThe sedimentary succession includes (1) the Mississippian to Triassic\nEllesmerian sequence (consisting of the Endicott, Lisburne and Sadlerochit\ngroups, and the Shublik Formation and Sag River Sandstone; (2) the Beaufortian\nsequence, comprising the Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Kingak Shale and the\noverlying Lower Cretaceous pebble shale unit; and (3) the Cretaceous to\nPaleocene Brookian sequence, which includes the Hue Shale and the Torok,\nNanushuk, Seabee, Tuluvak, Schrader Bluff, and Prince Creek formations.\n\nStratigraphic horizons that were mapped seismically include the tops of the\nFranklinian basement, the Endicott, Lisburne, and Sadlerochit groups, the\nShublik Formation, the Sag River Sandstone, the Lower Cretaceous unconformity\n(LCU), and the gamma-ray zone of the Hue Shale. Distinguishing criteria were\nestablished for the seismic-reflection characteristics for each of these\nhorizons, and the results were used in the correlation of units across the\nbasins and onto the bordering margins. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
