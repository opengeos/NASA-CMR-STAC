    "description": "Two Waves In Ice Observation Systems (Kohout, Alison L., Bill Penrose, Scott Penrose, and Michael J M Williams. 2015. \u201cA Device for Measuring Wave-Induced Motion of Ice Floes in the Antarctic Marginal Ice Zone.\u201d Annals of Glaciology 56 (69): 415\u201324. doi:10.3189/2015AoG69A600) were deployed about 1.5 km apart on ice floes close to latitude 62.8 S and longitude 29.8 E on 4th July 2017 (NYU1 and NYU2). \n\nThe region where the instruments were deployed (Antarctic Marginal Ice Zone) consisted of first-year ice on average 40 \u2013 60 cm thick. The instruments were deployed by hand by three people, lowered by crane from the ship to the ice on a basket cradle. NYU 1 was deployed on a rectangular ice floe of length 8 m and width 3 m, with a thickness of about 40 \u2013 50 cm. NYU 2 was deployed on a triangular ice floe of length 4 m and thickness 40 cm.\n\nThe temporal resolution is variability (every 15 minutes to 2 hourly). The survival of the sensors depended on staying fixed to the floe and the battery life. On 12th July, the sampling rate of NYU 2 was reduced from 15 minutes to 2 hourly to extend the battery life. On 13th July, NYU 1 overheated and the battery dropped below the operating voltage. NYU 2 continued to send back data for another six days, but then stopped sending data for an unknown reason on 19th July. \n\nRecords can support \n1. the assessment of metocean conditions in the Southern Oceans; and \n2. calibration and validation of wave and global circulation models.",
