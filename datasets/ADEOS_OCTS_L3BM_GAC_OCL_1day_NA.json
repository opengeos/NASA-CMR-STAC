    "description": "ADEOS OCTS L3BM GAC OCL 1day dataset is obtained from OCTS sensor onboard ADEOS and produced by NASDA (National Space Development Agency of Japan). Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) is sun-synchronous quasi-recurrent orbiter launched on August 17, 1996, and carries OCTS (Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner) and AVNIR (Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer) sensor.The main objectives of ADEOS (MIDORI) is to contribute to elucidation of phenomena of the earth system through integrated observation of geophysical parameters using a number of sensors. ADEOS operation on orbit was given up on June 30, 1997, because the generated power was lost due to the accident of the blanket of the solar array paddle breaking. OCTS observes the amount of chlorophyll and various substances contained in the sea, sea surface temperature, cloud formation process, etc by receiving 12 bands of wavelengths from the visible light region to the thermal infrared region. The observation field of OCTS is about 1400km, and it is possible to scan in the north-south direction. Those sensors aim at collecting global data for mainly understanding the state of the ocean and its phenomena.This product is daily L3BM, Level 3 binned map GAC (Global Area Coverage) OCL (Ocean Color) product includes Normalized water radiance at 412nm,443nm,490nm,520nm, and 565nm (nLw) and aerosol radiance at 670nm,765nm and 865nm. Level 3 Binned map products are generated from Level 3 Binned products and classified into three subproducts: ocean color, vegetation, and sea surface temperature. GAG OCL product is daily or weekly, monthly, annually integrated. This product is one of the Ocean Color product stores, and these parameters are array of normalized water-leaving radiance and aerosol radiance and palette data. The unit of geophysical quantity is \"mW/cm-2/mm-1/sr-1\". The provided format is HDF4 format. The image data object, 13m-data, in each binned map product is a byte-valued, 4,096 * 2,048 array of an Equal-Area Rectangular projection of the globe.",
