    "description": "The purpose of the cell map is to display the exploration maturity,\ntype of production, and distribution of production in quarter-mile\ncells in each of the oil and gas plays and each of the provinces\ndefined for the 1995 U.S. National Oil and Gas Assessment.\n\nCell maps for each oil and gas play were created by the USGS as a\nmethod for illustrating the degree of exploration, type of production,\nand distribution of production in a play or province. Each cell\nrepresents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells\nare coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are\npredominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and\ngas-producing, or dry. The well information was initially retrieved\nfrom the Petroleum Information (PI) Well History Control System\n(WHCS), which is a proprietary, commercial database containing\ninformation for most oil and gas wells in the U.S.  Cells were\ndeveloped as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying\nproprietary WHCS data. No proprietary data are displayed or included\nin the cell maps. The data from WHCS were current as of December 1990\nwhen the cell maps were created in 1994.\n\nOil and gas plays within province 20 (Uinta - Piceance Basin) are\nlisted here by play number, type, and name:\n\n   Number  Type           Name\n    2001  conventional   Piceance Tertiary Conventional\n    2002  conventional   Uinta Tertiary Oil and Gas\n    2003  conventional   Upper Cretaceous Conventional\n    2004  conventional   Cretaceous Dakota to Jurassic\n    2005  conventional   Permian-Pennsylvanian Sandstones and Carbonates\n    2007  continuous     Tight Gas Piceance Mesaverde Williams Fork\n    2009  continuous     Cretaceous Self-Sourced Fractured Shales Oil\n    2010  continuous     Tight Gas Piceance Mesaverde Iles\n    2014  conventional   Basin Margin Subthrusts\n    2015  continuous     Tight Gas Uinta Tertiary East\n    2016  continuous     Tight Gas Uinta Tertiary West\n    2018  continuous     Basin Flank Uinta Mesaverde\n    2020  continuous     Deep Synclinal Uinta Mesaverde\n    2050  coalbed gas    Uinta Basin - Book Cliffs\n    2051  coalbed gas    Uinta Basin - Sego\n    2052  coalbed gas    Uinta Basin - Emery\n    2053  coalbed gas    Piceance Basin - White River Dome\n    2054  coalbed gas    Piceance Basin - Western Basin Margin\n    2055  coalbed gas    Piceance Basin - Grand Hogback\n    2056  coalbed gas    Piceance Basin - Divide Creek Anticline\n    2057  coalbed gas    Piceance Basin - Igneous Intrusion",
