    "description": "This data set provides the results of (1) year-round measurements of methane (CH4) flux along with soil and air temperatures at five eddy covariance towers at sites located in the Alaskan Arctic tundra from June 2013 to December 2014 and (2) airborne CH4 and ozone (O3) measurements collected during Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) flight campaigns for years 2012 through 2014. The included site-level flux data at half-hourly intervals were calculated following standard eddy covariance data processing procedures. Also reported are daily mean methane flux, soil temperature with depth, and air temperature for each tower site. Also identified for each flux tower site were the \"zero curtain\" periods of extended cold when soil temperatures were poised near 0 degrees C. The reported CARVE airborne CH4 and O3 data were aggregated horizontally at 5 km intervals. Measurement heights are reported. These aircraft positions were treated as receptors in a Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model coupled with meteorology fields from the polar variant of the Weather and Research Forecasting model (WRF), in order to model the land surface influence on the aircraft-observed methane concentrations. The summed land surface influence on the aircraft data at each position is reported. For each airborne measurement, 2D surface influence fields (i.e. footprints) at two different spatial resolutions were derived using the WRF-STILT simulations. These gridded footprints are provided as netCDF formatted files. Regional C-CH4 fluxes were calculated from the CARVE CH4 data and footprints for the period 2012-2014 and are also included with this data set.
