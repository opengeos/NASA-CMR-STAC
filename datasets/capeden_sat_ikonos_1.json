    "description": "The following was done by a contractor  for the Australian Antarctic Division:\n\nA satellite image mosaic of Cape Denison, Mackellar Islands and part of the George V Land Coast was created  by combining parts of three satellite images acquired by the Ikonos satellite. Two of the images were acquired on 26 January 2001 and the third image was acquired on 31 January 2001.\nThe multispectral component of the mosaic was then \n(i) pan sharpened to increase the resolution from 4 metres to 1 metre; and  \n(ii) georeferenced.\n\nSee the Quality section for details about the satellite images and the georeferencing.\n\nThe georeferenced mosaic is stored in two parts. See the Satellite Image Catalogue entries in Related URLs for details.\n\nThree satellite image maps were produced from the georeferenced mosaic.  See the SCAR Map Catalogue entries in Related URLs for details.",
