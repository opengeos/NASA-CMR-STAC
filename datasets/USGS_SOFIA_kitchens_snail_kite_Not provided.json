    "description": "Life history traits and the population dynamics of the snail kite may vary considerably across space and over time. Understanding the influence of environmental (spatial and temporal) variation on demographic parameters is essential to understanding the population dynamics of a given species. Recognition of information needs for management decisions and conservation strategies has resulted in an increased emphasis on correlations to spatial and temporal environmental variation in relation to demographic studies. The purpose if this study is to provide valid estimates of the demographic parameters of the snail kite, including temporal and spatial variability due to environmental factors. These parameters will be used in a predictive model of the snail kite already developed under the ATLSS Program (Mooij et al. 2002).\n\nThe snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) is an endangered species that resides in the highly fluctuating ecosystem in the central and southern Florida wetlands. Many demographic traits, such as stage-dependent survival, reproduction, and movement of the snail kite vary both temporally and spatially. How these demographic parameters vary as a function of environmental conditions, hydrology in particular, is crucial for understanding how the snail kite will respond to proposed changes in water regulation in South and Central Florida. In particular, these data are needed for testing and improving the existing spatially-explicit, individual-based ATLSS snail kite model, developed by Mooij and Bennetts, which has recently been delivered to Department of Interior and other agencies (Mooij et al. 2002). From these data and the model, projections can be made on snail kite response to any hydrologic scenario. Also, continued estimates will be made of the rate of population growth. Assessing the demographic parameters is critical for identifying and evaluating the effectiveness of management actions and conservation strategies. In addition, new modeling techniques, such as structural modeling are being explored to better understand the effects of hydrology on the snail kite. The objectives of this project are the following: 1. To monitor the status of the snail kite population trends in central and southern Florida. 2. To provide estimates of demographic parameters for the spatially explicit individual-based model in ATLSS. 3. To collaborate with Dr. Wolf Mooij of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology to use snail kite data to validate the snail kite model.",
