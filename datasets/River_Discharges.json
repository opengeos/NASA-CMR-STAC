    "description": "This data set is a compilation of annual mean river discharge values\n      for 981 rivers from all regions of the world. It is meant to describe\n      freshwater discharges to the oceans. All files are ASCII files and\n      have not been compressed in any way. The procedure used to develop\n      this data set is as follows: Discharge values for as many rivers as\n      possible were gathered from as many sources as possible. Often, this\n      meant there were several values for a particular river.For each river,\n      obvious errors and duplicated values were removed. It was assumed that\n      if two or more sources quote the same value,then they are probably\n      referencing the same original source. For each river, the mean and\n      standard deviation of the remaining values were calculated. Then\n      values that were more than two standard deviationsfrom the mean were\n      eliminated as outlying values. The mean and standard deviation were\n      then calculated a second time and those are the values used in this\n      data set.",
