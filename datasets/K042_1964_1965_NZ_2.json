    "description": "A mineralisation survey was conducted in the Koettlitz-Blue Glacier and Taylor Valley region because previous work in these areas mapped Precambrian basement rocks similar to those found in mineralised areas in Australia, South Africa, Canada and Scandinavia. The geological environment in these areas was examined and mineralised boulders in the moraines were investigated. Environments in the area considered most likely to be mineralised are faults, amphibolite-marble-faults contacts, granite-marble contacts (Skarns) and pegmatitie dykes. Very few faults were mapped in the region and none were accessible. Several small faults were examined and found to be barren. Soil samples were collected in the vicinity of faults and examined for copper and zinc.  Amphibolite was found to be generally present in minor amounts within metasediments which are mainly marbles but field examination indicated that these were unfavourable for mineralisation. Granite-marble contacts were generally barren, but minor amounts of pyrrhotite and lesser chalcopyrite were found and traces of malachite were present at most localities. Numerous pegmatites were examined but they were invariably small and of a type commonly found in granite but rarely associated with mineralisation. The Koettlitz-Blue Glacier and Taylor Valley region is characterised by a lack of sulphides and must be regarded as generally unfavourable to base metal sulphide mineralisation. No appreciable quantities of industrial minerals were located during the survey, apart from marbles which are abundant and in most cases of apparently high quality.  Thirty soil samples were collected in the region and will be analysed for copper and zinc to test the effectiveness of geochemical prospecting in the region.",
