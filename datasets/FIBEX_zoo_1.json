    "description": "This dataset contains results from the First International BIOMASS Experiment (FIBEX) cruise of the Nella Dan. It is the first cruise in a series of six designed to assess the distribution and abundance of krill, Euphausia superba.\n\nThe FIBEX was an international programme co-ordinating the activities of 12 ships from 11 nations in the Southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Australia was responsible for surveying an area of the southern Indian Ocean south of 60 degrees and between 60 degrees and 90 degrees east longitude. Surveys of krill and other zooplankton were taken off Antarctica in the Australian sector (Mawson to Davis region) and Prydz Bay in January and March 1981. Species identity and abundance data were obtained. The major species investigated were Euphausia superba, Euphausia frigidia, Euphausia crystallorophias and Thysanoessa marcuria. Other pteropods and cephalopods were also studied.\n\nPhysical and chemical oceanography data and phytoplankton samples were also  obtained, as well as results from hydroacoustic surveys of krill biomass.\n\nSeveral files are available for download at the provided URL.  They include excel spreadsheets on summarised data, catch composition data and station lists.  Furthermore a pdf document of the report produced from the cruise is also available for download.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nDate\nTime (GMT)\nType of Trawl\nSpecies\nWeight\nNumber\nLatitude\nLongitude\nHaul Number\nTowing Speed (knots)\nWater Depth (metres)\nSea Temperature\nTarget Levels\nNet Open Time\nNet Close Time\nIce\nStation Number\nFlowmeter Reading\nTowed Distance (nautical miles)\nCatch Weight (grams)\nFishing Start Time\nFishing End Time\nTrajectory\nDepth Range Top\nDepth Range Bottom\nComments\n\nThese data are also available via the biodiversity database at the provided URL.  61 taxa and 1,115 observations are present in the biodiversity database collection.",
