    "description": "The GPM Ground Validation Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU) IFloodS dataset collected data from several sites in eastern Iowa during the spring of 2013. The APU dataset for the Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS) Field Experiment provides precipitation data including precipitation drop size, counts, and distribution. The goals of the campaign were to collect detailed measurements of precipitation at the Earth's surface using ground instruments and advanced weather radars and, simultaneously, collect data from satellites passing overhead. The APU is an optical disdrometer based on single particle extinction that measures particle size and fall velocity. This APU consists of the Parsivel, which was developed by OTT in Germany, and its support systems, which were designed and built by the University of Alabama in Huntsville.",
