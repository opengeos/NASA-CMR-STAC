    "description": "This dataset contains pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry measurements and chlorophyll concentrations for a series of incubation experiments performed during the 2012 SIPEX marine science voyage. The PAM files are in a raw format, but can be opened using Microsoft Excel. Light curves have not been processed.  \n\nBloom potential: 4-8 ice cores were collected from 4 fast ice stations during SIPEXII (Stations 20120926, 20121006, 20121013, 20121019) and ice collected from the back of the ship (Underway ice collection). The bottom 3cm was shaved off each ice core into filtered seawater. The concentration of chlorophyll a in the slurry was measured using a Turner 10AU fluorometer and the physiological health was determined using a PAM fluorometer. 5 x 50ml cultures from each ice station were incubated for 15-30 days (~50uE, ~0.2 degrees). At the end of the incubation period, the physiological health of the cultures was measured again, as was chlorophyll a. Post-incubation samples were also collected to determine nutrient concentration and species composition. \n\nC02: Brine algae was collected from sack holes drilled to a depth of ~45cm from 3 fast ice stations during SIPEXII (Stations 20121006, 20121013, 20121019). PAM fluorometry was used to measure cell health prior to the brine solution being aliquoted into 50ml culture vials to produce 4 treatments: 0.1% CO2, 1% CO2, 2% CO2, control. Cultures were incubated for 7-12 days. Post incubation analyses included: PAM, chlorophyll a, DIC, TA and cell identification. Samples were also collected for DNA extraction, which was performed at sea. \n\n\nThe files in this dataset are:\n1. McMinn Bloom Dynamics folder. This folder contains raw PAM data from each of the experiments. This is highly specialised photophysiology data, please consult the Walz PAM manual (www.walz.com) for interpretation. The dates and duration of each incubation experiment can be determined from the raw data.\n\n2. McMinn CO2 folder. This contains raw PAM data, dates and experiment duration.",
