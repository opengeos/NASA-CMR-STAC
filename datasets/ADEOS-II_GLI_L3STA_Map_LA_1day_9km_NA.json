    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L3 STA Map Aerosol radiance (1day,9km) is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km.  This product includes Aerosol radiance at 865, 380 nm. They are derived from an extension of the OCTS atmospheric correction algorithm. It treated multiple scattering among the aerosol particles and gas molecules, as well as the effects of variable ozone concentration, surface pressure, surface wind speed, and water vapor amount. The atmospheric correction with iterative procedure was developed to avoid the black pixel assumption, and to consider absorptive aerosol. This product is the representative values, which are estimated from level 3 binned products and projected onto map. The provided format is HDF. The physical unit is mW cm^-2 um^-1 sr^-1. The spatial resolution is 9 km. The statistical period is 1 day, also 8 days and 1month statistics are available. The projection method is EQR. The generation unit is Global. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
