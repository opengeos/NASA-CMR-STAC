    "description": "A detailed study of the Olympus Granite Gneiss with particular emphasis on foliation development and its relationship to deformation of Koettlitz Group metasediments, in an attempt to understand its origin was undertaken with a three stage investigation. Firstly, the Olympus Granite Gneiss in the Bull Pass area was studied and sampled with emphasis on its relation to Dais Granite. Secondly, the Koettlitz Group metasediment was studied and sampled looking in detail at anatectic processes associated with deformation of these rocks, including mapping and measuring sections of both Olympus Granite Gneiss/Koettlitz Group contacts. Thirdly,  the 'classic locality' of Dais Granite was studied and this rock-types relationship to highly deformed rocks mapped by earlier workers. Laboratory work included detailed structural analysis at all scales, petrographic studies and geochemical analyses.",
