    "description": "This metadata record describes a grid system for Macquarie Island formerly used by the Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania.\nThe grid was first adopted by Irynej Skira in 1974 and was based on the 1:50000 scale map of the island published by Australia's Division of National Mapping in 1971. Data was continually recorded on this system up to June 2001 when the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid was adopted.  \nThe dataset available for download from this metadata record includes a map with the grid system and a document compiled by Geoff Copson with details about converting from the Parks and Wildlife grid to the UTM grid. Geoff states in the document \"The 1971 map was particularly inaccurate in the centre two quarters of the island.  The grid for the Parks and Wildlife Service system was hand drawn and fairly variable.  Conversion values are averaged out on coastal points around the island.\"",
