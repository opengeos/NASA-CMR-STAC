    "description": "This dataset contains demersal fish data from 181 trawls from the HIMS 1989-90 (AADC-0075), FISHOG 1991-92 (AADC-00080) and THIRST 1993-94 (AADC-00073) surveys as well as a selection of matching environmental data, most obtained from the Polar_Environmental_Data AADC dataset. The dataset IDs above contain the full metadata for each survey and many environmental layers. The fish data has been modified from the data in the Historical Fish Data database in the following ways:\n1) Fish abundances are those recorded in the trawl logs (i.e. not limited to the ~200 measured and weighed for abundant species)\n2) Trawls noted as having issues in log books or without complete coverage of the selected environmental covariates were omitted\n3) Species that were rare (present at less than 8 sites) were omitted, leaving 15 species.\n\nThe dataset consists of a spreadsheets called fish.csv. It contains fish abundance records and associated environmental covariates for each haul\n\nBelow are descriptions of field headers in the fish.csv file as well as source, units and resolution for environmental covariates\n\nColumn  Name    Description     Units   Resolution      Source\n1       Champsocephalus_gunnari Species abundance       Count   NA      AAD Historical Fish Database checked
