    "description": "Diatom and biogenic particle fluxes were investigated over a two-year and six-year periods at the Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zones, respectively, in the Australian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Both sites were located along ~ 140 degrees E: station 47 degrees S was set on the abyssal plain of the central SAZ whereas station 54 degrees S was placed on a bathymetric high of the Southeast Indian Ridge in the PFZ. The data sets contain diatom species and biogeochemical flux data measured at 1000 m at the 47 degrees S site between 1999-2001 and at 800 m at the 54 degrees S site during six selected years between 1997-2007. All traps were MacLane Parflux sediment traps: conical in shape with a 0.5 m2 opening area and equipped with a carousel of 13 or 21 sampling cups. Shortest intervals corresponded with the austral summer and autumn ranging typically between 4.25 and 10 days, whereas the longest intervals were 60 days and corresponded with winter.\nTotal fluxes of particulates at both traps were highly seasonal, with maxima registered during the austral spring and summer and very low fluxes during winter. Seasonality was more pronounced in the 54 degrees S site. Biogenic silica (SiO2) was the dominant bulk component in the PFZ while carbonate (CaCO3) dominated the particle fluxes at the SAZ. POC export was relatively similar between sites despite significant differences in the total diatom flux. \nDiatom frustules from 94 taxa were identified over the entire experiment. The dominant species of the diatom assemblage was Fragilariopsis kerguelensis at both sites, representing 43% and 59% of the integrated diatom assemblage at the 47 degrees S and 54 degrees S sites, respectively. Secondary contributors to the diatom assemblage at the 47 degrees S were Azpeitia tabularis, Thalassiosira sp. 1, Nitzschia bicapitata, resting spores of Chaetoceros spp., Thalassiosira oestrupii var. oestrupii, Hemidiscus cuneiformis and Roperia tesselata. Subordinate contributions to the diatom assemblage correspond to Pseudo-nitzschia lineola cf. lineola, Pseudo-nitzschia heimii, Thalassiosira gracilis group and Fragilariopsis pseudonana, Fragilariopsis rhombica and Thalassiosira lentiginosa. \n\nData available: two excel files containing sampling dates and depths, raw counts, relative abundance and fluxes (valves m-2 d-1) of the diatom species, and biogenic particle fluxes measured at 1000 m and 800 m depth at the 47 degrees S and 54 degrees S sites, respectively. Each file contains four spreadsheets: raw diatom valve counts, relative abundance of diatom species and valve flux of diatom species and biogenic particle composition and fluxes.  Detailed information of the column headings is provided below.\n\nCup - Cup (=sample) number\nDepth - vertical location of the sediment trap in meters below the surface \nMid-point date - Mid date of the sampling interval\nLength (days) - number of days the cup was open\n\nGirdle bands instead of valves were counted for Dactyliosolen antarcticus Castracane. Therefore, D. antarcticus girdles counts were not included in relative abundance calculations.\n\nDates of data collection:\n47 degrees S site: July 1999 - October 2001 (two-year record)\n54 degrees S site:  September 1997 - February 1998, July 1999 - August 2000, November 2002 - October 2004 and December 2005 - October 2007 (six-year record).",
