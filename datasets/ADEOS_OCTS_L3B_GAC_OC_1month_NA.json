    "description": "ADEOS OCTS L3B GAC OC 1month dataset is obtained from OCTS sensor onboard ADEOS and produced by NASDA (National Space Development Agency of Japan). Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) is sun-synchronous quasi-recurrent orbiter launched on August 17, 1996, and carries OCTS (Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner) and AVNIR (Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer) sensor.The main objectives of ADEOS (MIDORI) is to contribute to elucidation of phenomena of the earth system through integrated observation of geophysical parameters using a number of sensors. ADEOS operation on orbit was given up on June 30, 1997, because the generated power was lost due to the accident of the blanket of the solar array paddle breaking. OCTS observes the amount of chlorophyll and various substances contained in the sea, sea surface temperature, cloud formation process, etc by receiving 12 bands of wavelengths from the visible light region to the thermal infrared region. The observation field of OCTS is about 1400km, and it is possible to scan in the north-south direction. Those sensors aim at collecting global data for mainly understanding the state of the ocean and its phenomena. This product is monthly L3B, Level 3 binned GAC (Global Area Coverage) Ocean Color (OC) product (temporarily and spatially sampled) from level 2 data. GAG OC product is daily or weekly, monthly, annually integrated. Ocean color product stores Bin data, Normalized water-leaving radiance at 412nm, 443nm, 490nm, 520nm, 565nm, Aerosol radiance at 670nm, 765nm, 865nm, epsilon(670 : 865), and tau-a  at 865nm. CZCS-like pigment, chlor_a,  K_490, and chlor_a_K_490 data. These parameters are sum of natural logs of binned pixel values for corresponding and squares of natural logs of binned pixel values for corresponding each parameter.Normalized water-leaving radiance, Aerosol radiance, epsilon, and tau-a at 865nm data are stored in one subordinate file. The physical quantity unit except epsilon and tau_865 is \u00e2\u0080\u009dmW/cm-2/mm-1/sr-1\u00e2\u0080\u009d. CZCS_pigment is CZCS-like pigment concentration data. The physical quantity unit is \"mg/m-3\". Chlor_a data is Chlorophyll a concentration data. The physical quantity unit is \"mg/m-3\". K_490 data is diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. The physical quantity unit is \"m-1\". Chlor_a_K_490 is integral chlorophyll, calculated using the Level 2 values chlorophyll a divided by K(490). The physical quantity unit is \"mg/m-2\".The provided format is HDF4 format. The unit of geophysical quantity in this product is \"mg/m^3\".",
