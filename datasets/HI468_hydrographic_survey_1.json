    "description": "The RAN Australian Hydrographic Service conducted hydrographic survey HI468 at Davis, January to March 2010. The survey was conducted jointly with Geoscience Australia and the Australian Antarctic Division. The main survey area was near Davis but additional survey lines were followed to Long Fjord to the north and to Crooked Fjord and the Sorsdal Glacier in the south.\nThe survey dataset, which includes the Report of Survey, was provided to the Australian Antarctic Data Centre by the Australian Hydrographic Office and is available from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre by request.\nThe RAN Australian Hydrographic Service team was lead by LCDR R.D.Bowden.\n\nThe data are not suitable for navigation.\n\nGeoscience Australia produced bathymetric and backscatter gridded datasets from the survey data which are available via the metadata record 'Coastal seabed mapping survey, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, February-March 2010' with Entry ID: Davis_multibeam_grids.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Division produced two bathymetric maps from the survey data.
