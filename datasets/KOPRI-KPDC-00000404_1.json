    "description": "Measuring atmospheric ozone in the marine boundary layer was monitored from October 10 to October 29 by the Thermo 49i O3 analyzer along the cruise track of R/V Araon from Incheon, to Christchurch, carrying out a series of expeditions in the West Equatorial Pacific Transect. The air inlet to the instrument wa located at 29 m asl and the O3 was measured at 0.017 Hz.\nTropospheric ozone (O3) is a strong greenhouse gas and it has been significantly increasing during the last century. Moreover it is an important air pollutant which adversely influence to the human health and ecosystems. Therefore our continuous shipborne measurement will help understand global radiative forcing and anthropogenic influences in the atmosphere.",
