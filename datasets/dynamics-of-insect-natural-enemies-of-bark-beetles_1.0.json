    "description": "In 1994 a large area of mountain spruce forest was infested by the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) in the Gandberg forest near Schwanden, canton Glarus, Switzerland (46.99145 N, 9.10768 E, 1300 m a.s.l.). In a perimeter of approx. 13 ha, 50 infested dead spruce trees were selected and labelled in 1994. The trees were randomly distributed across the whole perimeter and attributed to 5 groups of 10 trees of approx. 25-40 cm diameter each. In each of the following 5 years (1995-1999), the trees of one of these groups were cut in early spring and transported by helicopter to a vehicle-accessible road. Of each log, two bolts of 1.5 m length were cut, one from the base and one from the beginning of the crown. The bolts were transported by truck to the institute WSL and exposed in emergence eclectors (metal cabinets of approx. 2.0x0.5x0.5 m) in a greenhouse to let the insects emerge. Each tree was left 2 years in the eclectors to allow insects with more than 1 year development time to emerge. During 2 months in the winter between the two exposure years the bolts were removed from the eclectors and exposed to ambient winter temperatures for chilling. They were then moved back to the eclectors in the greenhouse.  Additionally, 18 living unattacked trees were provided with a pheromone lure in early spring 1995 to induce new bark beetle attack. 10 infested trees were then cut and processed as described above.  The water-filled emergence traps of the eclectors were emptied monthly-bimonthly and the insects were separated to taxonomic groups and eventually identified by specialists. Before disposing the logs, tree age was recorded by tree-ring-counting.",
