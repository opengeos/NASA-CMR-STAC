    "description": "These maps present preliminary assessments of the probability of debris-flow\nactivity and estimates of peak discharges that can potentially be generated by\ndebris flows issuing from basins burned by the Cedar and Paradise Fires of\nOctober 2003 in southern California in response to 25-year, 10-year, and 2-year\nrecurrence, 1-hour duration rain storms. The probability maps are based on the\napplication of a logistic multiple regression model that describes the percent\nchance of debris-flow production from an individual basin as a function of\nburned extent, soil properties, basin gradients, and storm rainfall. The\npeak-discharge maps are based on application of a multiple-regression model\nthat can be used to estimate debris-flow peak discharge at a basin outlet as a\nfunction of basin gradient, burn extent, and storm rainfall. Probabilities of\ndebris-flow occurrence for the Cedar Fire range between 0 and 98% and estimates\nof debris-flow peak discharges range between 893 and 5,987 ft3/s (25 to 170\nm3/s). Basins burned by the Paradise Fire show probabilities for debris-flow\noccurrence between 2 and 98%, and peak discharge estimates between 1,814 and\n5,980 ft3/s (51 and 169 m3/s). These maps are intended to identify those basins\nthat are most prone to the largest debris-flow events and provide critical\ninformation for the preliminary design of mitigation measures and for the\nplanning of evacuation timing and routes.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
