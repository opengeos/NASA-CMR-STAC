    "description": "Taken from sections of the Report:\n\nThe 2002-03 Mapping and Geographic Information Program (MAGIP) field season was undertaken from Davis Station. Nigel Peters from Sinclair Knight Merz undertook this season's fieldwork, the results of which are described in the following report.\n      \nThe main objective for this season was to provide photo control mapping in the Rauer Group, with photo control also required at Davis Station and Marine Plains. A number of other tasks were undertaken in support of various scientific and engineering programs.\n\nThe tasks outlined in the surveyors brief are varied and numerous and have been included to provide the surveyor with a full and appropriate work program. The tasks are prioritised, usually with one or two major tasks with a number of minor tasks listed to be undertaken if the opportunity arises. This season's Survey Brief has been included in Appendix A with a summary of achievements listed in Appendix B.\n      \nThe following report covers the fieldwork undertaken by myself during the 2002/2003 ANARE Summer Field Season. Data collected in support of other scientific programs has been included in this report primarily as a record of work undertaken by the mapping program. These data have been supplied to the various scientists for inclusion in their studies.\n\nSequence of Events\n\n# 4th  November - 12th November 2002 -  Pre-Departure Training\n - Field training for expeditioners at Bronte Park prior to the departure of V2.\n - Survey briefing at Antarctic Division by Mapping Officer, Mr Henk Brolsma\n\n# 20th November -5th December 2002 - Voyage 2\n - Final preparation and checking and replacement of damaged equipment\n - The Aurora Australis departed Hobart on the evening of 22nd November en route for Zhongshan, Davis and Mawson\n - The Aurora Australis arrived of Zhongshan on the 3rd December where Chinese personal were deployed\n - The Aurora Australis stopped approximately 1km off shore from Davis on the evening of the 4th December and arrived at Davis Station 5th December\n\n# 6th December - 10th December  2002 - Davis Station\n - Davis Resupply involving unloading and storage of food and equipment\n\n# 11th December - 31st December 2002 - Davis Station \n - Down loading Tide Gauge at Davis Station\n - GPS measurements AUS303\n - Coordination and levelling building Heights\n - Coordination of control points Rauer Group\n - Coordination of control points Davis\n\n# 1st January - 20th  January 2003  - Davis Station\n - Coordination of control points Rauer Group\n - Antenna Farm levelling\n - Surveys at Brooks, Bandits and Watts huts\n\n# 21st January - 26th   January 2003 - Law Base\n - Law Base Tide gauge downloading \n - GPS connections to Davis\n \n# 27th January - 9th February 2003 - Davis Station\n - Tarbuck Crag repeater survey\n - Skyline Survey Antenna Farm\n - Establish new Tide Pole at Deep Lake\n - Station duties loading equipment on to Ice Bird\n\n# 10th February - 22nd February 2003 - Voyage 5\n - Depart Davis \n - Arrive Hobart 22nd February \n\nScope of Work\n      \nThe Antarctic Mapping Officer Mr Henk Brolsma provided the scope of works within the Surveyors Brief for the 2002- 2003 field survey program (Appendix A). The following is a summation of the survey requirements for this season.\n\n# Rauer Group \n - Photo control are required throughout the Rauer Group at specified locations\n\n# Davis \n - Down Load Tide gauge\n - Timed water level measurements\n - Levelling between tide gauge benchmarks, including GPS observation\n - Update station map and determine levels for all building floors, roof levels and the ground at the corner of every building\n - Photo control for orthophoto at Davis and  at Heideman Bay\n\n# Zhongshan\n - Download tide gauge\n - Timed water level measurements\n - Height connection from Law Base to tide gauge bench mark\n - Level between tide gauge benchmarks\n - Check existing marks established for tide gauge location\n\n# Vestfold Hills\n - Deep Lake depth pole\n - Take pole readings\n - Repair depth pole\n - Lake levelling\n - Location of bench marks",
