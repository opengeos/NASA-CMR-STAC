    "description": "The spatial distribution of \u03b1-HCH and the net direction of air/water gas exchange were determined between November 1997 and February 1998. Air and water samples were collected between South Atlantic Ocean (South Africa) and Antarctica SANAE Base (70\u00b0S, 3\u00b0E). The \u03b1-HCH concentrations in air and surface water were much lower than in Arctic regions, consistent with the historically lower usage of technical HCH in the Southern Hemisphere. The water/air fugacity ratios of \u03b1-HCH were lower than or equal to 1.0, indicating steady state or net deposition conditions. One analysis of the enantiomeric fractionation was also made The results showed that the \u03b1-HCH in water was enantioselectively metabolized and that the two isomers [(-)\u03b1-HCH and (+)\u03b1-HCH] in the air boundary layer reflected those in surface water, showing the bidirectional nature of gas exchange.",
