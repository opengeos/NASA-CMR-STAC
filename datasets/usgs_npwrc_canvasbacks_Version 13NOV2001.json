    "description": "Age, productivity, and other factors affecting breeding performance of\ncanvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) are poorly understood. Consequently, we tested\nwhether reproductive performance of female canvasbacks varied with age and\nselected environmental factors in southwestern Manitoba from 1974 to 1980.\nNeither clutch size, nest parasitism, nest success, nor the number of\nducklings/brood varied with age. Return rates, nest initiation dates,\nrenesting, and hen success were age-related. Return rates averaged 21% for\nsecond-year (SY) and 69% for after-second-year (ASY) females (58% for\nthird-year and 79% for after-third-year females). Additionally, water\nconditions and spring temperatures influenced chronology of arrival, timing of\nnesting, and reproductive success. Nest initiation by birds of all ages was\naffected by minimum April temperatures. Clutch size was higher in nests\ninitiated earlier. Interspecific nest parasitism did not affect clutch size,\nnest success, hen success, or hatching success. Nest success was lower in dry\nyears (17%) than in moderately wet (54%) or wet (60%) years. Nests per female\nwere highest during wet years. No nests of SY females were found in dry years.\nIn years of moderate to good wetland conditions, females of all ages nested. \nPredation was the primary factor influencing nest success. Hen success averaged\n58% over all years. The number of ducklings surviving 20 days averaged\n4.7/brood. Because SY females have lower return rates and hen success than ASY\nfemales, especially during drier years, management to increase canvasback\npopulations might best be directed to increasing first year recruitment (no. of\nfemales returning to breed) and to increasing overall breeding success by\nreducing predation and enhancing local habitat conditions during nesting.",
