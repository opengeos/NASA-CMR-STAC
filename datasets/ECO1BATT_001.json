    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52\u00b0 N and 52\u00b0 S latitudes. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found in figure 2 on the ECOSTRESS website.\r\n\r\nThe ECO1BATT Version 1 data product provides both corrected and uncorrected attitude quaternions and spacecraft ephemeris data obtained from the ISS. The data are provided in 1 second intervals by the ISS, and each product file contains vectors from the duration of the orbit. The time elements are copied from the ISS raw data.\r\n\r\nThe ECO1BATT Version 1 data product contains layers of corrected and uncorrected attitude quaternions, spacecraft ephemeris data including Earth-centered inertial (ECI) position and velocity, and associated time elements.
