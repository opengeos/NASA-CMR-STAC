    "description": "The major objectives of this project are as follows:\n\n1. To determine the composition and distribution of algal flora from a wide\nrange of habitats, which provide a conductive niche for algal population in\nAntarctica.\n2. To compare the Antarctic and tropical algal flora, in order to determine the\ndegree of species endemism based on evolutionary process.\n3. To study the important role of habitat specificity in determining the\ncomposition of diatom assemblages.\n4. To test the utility and suitability of diatom community structure as\nindicators of environmental stress.\n \nThis is done by: 1. Conducting an ecological survey of microalgal distribution\nat Australian Antarctic station sites by looking into several types of habitat.\n2. Identifying the microalgae samples collected based on morphology using light\nmicroscopy and SEM. 3. Comparing the algae community, structure and\ndistribution from the tropics. \n\nThe principal milestones of the project are as follows: 1. Information of\nmicroalgal distribution at several sites in Antarctica. 2. Collection of\nmicroalgae cultures.  3. Completion of identification of Antarctic microalgae. \nIn collaboration with the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) we have gone on\nan expeditions to Australian Antarctic Station of Casey and Davis. Collection\nof samples was made from various sources such as  water, snow and soil and we\nhave established a list of microalgae species in our collection. Comparative\nstudies on the species diversity and distribution with tropical microalgae\ncommunities are being conducted. Physiological studies are currently in\nprogress.",
