    "description": "Metadata record for data from AAS (ASAC) Project 2933.\n\nWhile it is generally thought that Antarctic organisms are highly sensitive to pollution, there is little data to support or disprove this. Such data is essential if realistic environmental guidelines, which take into account unique physical, biological and chemical characteristics of the Antarctic environment, are to be developed. Factors that modify bioavailability, and the effects of common contaminants on a range of Antarctic organisms from micro-algae to macro-invertebrates will be examined. Risk assessment techniques developed will provide the scientific basis for prioritising contaminated site remediation activities in marine environments, and will contribute to the development of guidelines specific to Antarctica.\n\nJuvenile Gastropod toxicity tests, Kingston 2007\n\nDuring 2007 a series of toxicity tests, using Antarctic marine invertebrates, were conducted at Australian Antarctic Division laboratories in Kingston, Tasmania, to test the sensitivity of Antarctic nearshore biota to a range of common metal contaminants. This data record describes two such tests, using juveniles of the microgastropod Skenella paludionoides. The first test (T01) was a 14 day test (start date: 20/08/2007) using juveniles less than 7 days old. The second test (T02) was a 12 week test (start date: 10/09/2007) using juveniles of the same cohort, that were less than 28 days at the commencement of the test. A range of concentrations of three single metals (cadmium, copper and zinc) were applied as test treatments to determine this species sensitivity to these common metal contaminants. T01 included all three metals, T02 used copper and zinc only. \n\nData are provided in the excel file:\nCaseyKingston0607_Microgastropod.xlsx\nThis file includes descriptive test details, test data and measured metal concentrations of test solutions. \n\nScanned copies of laboratory notebook and test scoresheets are provided in PDF files: \n- CKing_ Ecotox Kingston 0607.pdf\n- Kingston07-microgastropod-juv-T01.pdf",
