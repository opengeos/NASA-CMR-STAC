    "description": "This data set is intended for scientific research of beach morphology and\nvolume changes.\n\nBiannual beach profiles were collected at 42 Oahu and 36 Maui Locations between\nAugust 1994 and August 1999. Surveys were conducted at approximately\nsummer-winter intervals and extend from landward of the active beach to about\n-4 meters water depth. Profile data on this CDROM are presented in both\nMicrosoft EXCEL 97/98 & 5.0/95 Workbook (.xls) format and comma separated value\n(.csv) format. Graphical representation of the surveys (x vs. z and x vs. y)\nare presented in EXCEL format only. Site descriptions, including beach\nlocation, directions to site, GPS information, and a description of Reference\nPoints used, are available in both EXCEL and ADOBE ACROBAT .pdf format.\n\nCross-shore beach profile data were collected as a component of the Hawaii\nCoastal Erosion Study, a cooperative effort by U.S. Geological Survey and\nUniversity of Hawaii in order to document seasonal and longer-term variations\nin beach volume and behavior. The overall objectives of the Hawaii Coastal\nErosion Study are to document the recent history of shoreline change in Hawaii\nand to determine the primary factor(s) responsible for coastal erosion in\nlow-latitude environments for the purpose of predicting future changes and to\nprovide quality scientific data that is useful to other scientists, planners,\nengineers, and coastal managers.\n\nThe overall strategy consists of first quantifying the magnitude and location\nof serious erosion problems followed by close monitoring of coastal change in\ncritical areas. Bi-annual beach profiles have been collected at over 40\ncritical beach sites on the islands of Oahu and Maui. Once sufficient\nbackground information is analyzed and key problems are defined, field sites\nwill be selected for detailed process- oriented studies (both physical and\nbiological) to gain an understanding of the complex relationships between reef\ncarbonate production, sediment dispersal, and the interaction of man-made\nstructures with sediment movement along the shore.\n\nInformation derived from this project will be used to develop general\nguidelines for sediment production, transport, and deposition of low- latitude\ncoasts.  Planned major products include a comprehensive atlas of coastal\nhazards, journal articles and reports presenting results of our studies, and a\n\"living\" database of shoreline history and changes based on results of the\nbeach profile monitoring and softcopy photogrammetric analysis.",
