    "description": "AirMSPI_ACEPOL_Terrain-projected_Georegistered_Radiance_Data are AirMSPI terrain-projected georegistered radiance products acquired during the Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) flight campaign. \r\n\r\nAirMSPI Level 1B2 products contain radiometric and polarimetric images of clouds, aerosols, and the surface of the Earth. In particular, products contain map-projected data at 8 wavelengths: 355, 380, 445, 470, 555, 660, 865, and 935 nm. The data products include radiance, time, solar zenith, solar azimuth, view zenith, and view azimuth for all spectral bands. Wavelengths for which polarization information is available (470, 660, and 865 nm) also include the Stokes parameters Q and U, as well as degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and angle of linear polarization (AOLP). Q, U, and AOLP are reported relative to both the scattering and view meridian planes. Files are distributed in HDF-EOS-5 format.\r\n\r\nThis release of AirMSPI data contains all targets acquired during the Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) flight campaign. ACEPOL was based out of Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, CA, and focused on assessing the capabilities of proposed future instruments by the ACE pre-formulation study to answer fundamental science questions associated with aerosols, clouds, air quality and global ocean ecosystems. AirMSPI data were acquired from October 19 through November 9, 2017.",
