    "description": "Over time there have been a number of tide gauges deployed at Davis Station, Antarctica.  The data download files contain further information about the gauges, but some of the information has been summarised here.  Note that this metadata record only describes tide gauge data from 1993 to 2017.  More recent data are described elsewhere.\n\nTide Gauge 3 (TG003)\nThis folder contains the following folders:-\nearly_tg_files \n   \n\tmonthly_tg_files\n\tmonthly download files from the submerged tide gauge at Davis deployed in March 1993.\n\tThese files are ASCII hexadecimal files. They need to be converted to decimal.\n\tThe resultant values are absolute seawater pressures in mbar.\n\t\n\tRemaining files are downloaded in normal format obtained directly from tide gauge.\n\t\nraw\n\tmemory images from submerged tide gauge. file extension is memory bank number. \n\tThese files are processed by a utility called tgxtract.exe which creates files in same format as those in old_tidedata folder.\n\tThese file have extension .srt. They are then converted to decimal pressure values.\n\noutput\n\toutput file (.srt) which have been sent to BoM.\n\nTide Gauge 6 (TG006)\nThis folder contains the following folders:-\n\nraw\n\tmemory images from submerged tide gauge. file extension is memory bank number. \n\tThese files are processed by a utility called tgxtract.exe which creates files in same format as original download format.\n\tThese file have extension .srt. \n\tThese files are ASCII hexadecimal files.

It was intended to be submerged in about 7 metres of water in a purpose made concrete mooring in the shape of a truncated pyramid. The gauge measures pressure using a Paroscientific Digiquartz Pressure Transducer with a full scale pressure of 30 psi absolute. The accuracy of the transducer is 1 in 10,000 of full scale over the calibrated temperature. The overall accuracy of the system is better than +/- 3 mm for a known water density. Data is retrieved from the gauges by lowering a coil assembly on the end of a cable over a projecting knob on the top of the gauge and by use of an interface unit, a serial connection can be established to the gauge. Time setting and data retrieval can be then achieved. One of these of these gauges was deployed at Davis in early 1993 in a mooring in ???? bay. Data has been retrieved from these gauges irregularly since then. The records are complete since deployment except for a few days in late 1995. The loss was caused by a fault in the software which allows directory entries to overwrites data when the directory memory has been filled. Conversion of raw data to tidal records is done as detailed in document DATAFORMAT1.DOC . As the current gauge is expected to require a new battery soon, a new mooring has been placed close to the original. A new gauge is at Davis ready to be deployed as time permits.\nLevelling\n\nLevelling of the gauge at Davis was done by installing a temporary pressure type gauge in shallow water and recording sealevel for 10 days. The temporary gauge was precisely levelled to a permanent benchmark. The temporary gauge was then calibrated using a known height of seawater from the bay at the same temperature as the water in the bay. The density of the seawater was accurately measured. This work, in conjunction with the tidal records from the submerged gauge have enabled a MSL for Davis to be established. Permanent Tide Gauge. No suitable sites for an Aquatrak type gauge at Davis have been identified.\n\nDocumentation dated 2008-10-17\nThere are two submerged tide gauges at Davis. One is soon to be removed to have its battery replaced.\nThese gauges record pressure and temperature values. The download software only formats these records to produce 10 minute average presure values (hPa) and unscaled temperature values.\n",
