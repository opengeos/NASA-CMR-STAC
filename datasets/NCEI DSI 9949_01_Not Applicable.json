    "description": "Service Records and Retention System (SRRS) is historical digital data set DSI-9949, a collection of products created by the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) and archived at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [formerly National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)]. SRRS was a network of computers and associated hardware whose purpose was to transmit and store a large number of NWS products and make them available as needed. Basic meteorological and hydrological data, analyses, forecasts, and warnings are distributed among NWS offices over the AFOS (Automation of Field Operations and Services) communications system since 1978. These include PIREP (aircraft reports from pilots), AIRMET (aeronautical meteorological bulletins), SIGMET (significant meteorological information), surface and upper air plotted unanalyzed maps, air stagnation, precipitable water, Forecasts such as wind and temperature aloft, thickness and analysis, fire weather, area, local, zone, state, agricultural advisory, and terminal; and Warnings such as marine, severe weather, hurricane and tornado. The AFOS system was developed to increase the productivity and effectiveness of NWS personnel and to increase the timeliness and quality of their warning and forecasting services.  \n\nThis format version of the SRRS data was archived at NCEI from 1983 to 2001 (when a new format was created). The NCEI can service requests for products from the SRRS; two types of products are available to the user: 1) graphic displays of meteorological analyses and forecast charts (limited), and 2) alphanumeric displays of narrative summaries and meteorological/hydrological data. The following is a partial list of historical SRRS products available through the NCDC: rawinsonde data above 100 MB; AIREPS buoy reports; coastal flood warning; Coast Guard surface report; climatological report (daily and misc, incl monthly reports); weather advisory Coastal Waters Forecast Center (CWSU); weather statement; 3- to 5-day extended forecast; average 6- to 10-day weather outlook (local and national); aviation area forecast winds aloft forecast; flash flood statements, watches and warnings; flood statement; flood warning forecast; medium range guidance; FOUS relative humidity/temperature guidance; FOUS prog max/min temp/POP guidance; FOUS wind/cloud guidance; Great Lakes forecast; hurricane local statement; high seas forecast; international aviation observations; local forecast; local storm report; rawinsonde observation - mandatory levels;, METAR formatted surface weather observation; marine weather statement; short term rorecast; non-precipitation warnings/watches/advisories; nearshore marine forecast (Great Lakes only), offshore aviation area forecast; offshore forecast; other marine products, other surface weather observations, pilot report plain language, ship report, state pilot report, collective recreational report; narrative radar summary radar observation; hydrology-meteorology data report; river summary; river forecast; miscellaneous river product; river recreation statement; ; regional weather summary; surface aviation observation; preliminary notice of watch and canc msg SVR; local storm watch and warning; cancelation msg SELS watch; point information message; state forecast discussion ; state forecast rawinsonde observation - significant levels; surface ship report at intermediate synoptic time; surface ship report at non-synoptic time; surface ship report at synoptic time; special weather statement international; SIGMET severe local storm watch and area outline; special marine warning; intermediate surface synoptic observation; main surface synoptic observation; severe thunderstorm warning; severe weather statement; severe storm outlook; narrative state weather summary; terminal forecast; tropical cyclone discussion; marine/aviation tropical cyclone advisory; public tropical cyclone advisory; tornado warning; transcribed weather broadcast; tropical weather discussion; tropical weather outlook and summary; AIRMET SIGMET zone forecast; terminal forecast (prior to 7/1/96); winter weather warnings, watches, advisories; marine advisory/warning; special marine warning; miscellaneous product convective SIGMET ; local ice forecast; area forecast discussion; public information statement. SRRS (DSI-9949) by the Gateway SRRS (DSI-9957; C00583). NWS products after 2001 can be obtained from those systems, from NCEI.",
