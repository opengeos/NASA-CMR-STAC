    "description": "The data set for the Butler Peak quadrangle has been prepared by the Southern\nCalifornia Areal Mapping Project (SCAMP), a cooperative project sponsored\njointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Division of Mines and\nGeology, as part of an ongoing effort to utilize a Geographical Information\nSystem (GIS) format to create a regional digital geologic database for southern\nCalifornia. This regional database is being developed as a contribution to the\nNational Geologic Map Data Base of the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping\nProgram of the USGS. Development of the data set for the Butler Peak quadrangle\nhas also been supported by the U.S. Forest Service, San Bernardino National\nForest.\n\nThe digital geologic map database for the Butler Peak quadrangle has been\ncreated as a general-purpose data set that is applicable to other land-related\ninvestigations in the earth and biological sciences.  For example, the U.S. \nForest Service, San Bernardino National Forest, is using the database as part\nof a study of an endangered plant species that shows preference for particular\nrock type environments.  The Butler Peak database is not suitable for\nsite-specific geologic evaluations at scales greater than 1:24,000 (1 in =\n2,000 ft).\n\nThis data set maps and describes the geology of the Butler Peak 7.5'\nquadrangle, San Bernardino County, California.  Created using Environmental\nSystems Research Institute's ARC/INFO software, the data base consists of the\nfollowing items: (1) a map coverage showing geologic contacts and units,(2) a\nscanned topographic base at a scale of 1:24,000, and (3) attribute tables for\ngeologic units (polygons), contacts (arcs), and site-specific data (points). \nIn addition, the data set includes the following graphic and text products: (1)\nA PostScript graphic plot-file containing the geologic map on a 1:24,000\ntopographic base accompanied by a Description of Map Units (DMU), a Correlation\nof Map Units (CMU), and a key to point and line symbols; (2) PDF files of the\nDMU and CMU, and of this Readme, and (3) this metadata file.\n\nThe geologic map data base contains original U.S. Geological Survey data\ngenerated by detailed field observation and by interpretation of aerial\nphotographs. The map was created by transferring lines from the aerial\nphotographs to a 1:24,000 mylar orthophoto-quadrangle and then to a base-stable\ntopographic map.  This map was then scribed, and a .007 mil, right-reading,\nblack line clear film made by contact photographic processes.The black line was\nscanned and auto-vectorized by Optronics Specialty Company, Northridge, CA. \nThe non-attributed scan was imported into ARC/INFO, where the database was\nbuilt. Within the database, geologic contacts are represented as lines (arcs),\ngeologic units as polygons, and site-specific data as points. Polygon, arc, and\npoint attribute tables (.pat, .aat, and .pat, respectively) uniquely identify\neach geologic datum and link it to other tables (.rel) that provide more\ndetailed geologic information.",
