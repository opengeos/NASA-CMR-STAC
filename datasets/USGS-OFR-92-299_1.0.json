    "description": "Information about and data from the USGS Open-File Report 92-299 (Molecular\nand isotopic analyses of the hydrocarbon gases within gas hydrate-bearing rock\nunits of the Prudhoe Bay-Kuparuk River area in northern Alaska) are available\nOn-line via the World Wide Web:\n\n\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/of92-299//\"\n\nor \"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1992/of92-299/\"\n\n The following information about the data set was provided by the data center\ncontact:\n\n  The objective of this study was to document the molecular and isotopic\ncomposition of the gas trapped within the gas hydrate-bearing stratigraphic\nintervals overlying the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River oil fields.  To reach\nthis objective, we have analyzed cuttings gas and free gas samples collected\nfrom 10 drilling-production wells in the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River fields.\n\n  The dataset includes a report documenting the materials, the procedures used\nto analyze them, and the results.  Results are given in tabular form as\nspreadsheets showing headspace, headspace/free gas, and blended headspace\nanalyses.  Gas characteristics analyzed include nitrogen, carbon dioxide,\nmethane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, isobutane, n-butane, isopentane,\nn-pentane, stable carbon isotope composition of the methane, ethane, and carbon\ndioxide fractions, and deuterium isotope composition of the methane fraction.\n\n  Methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon gas within the gas hydrate- bearing\nrock units of the Prudhoe Bay-Kuparuk River area in the North Slope of Alaska.\nIsotopic analysis indicates that both microbial and thermogenic processes have\ncontributed to the formation of this methane.  The thermogenic component\nprobably migrated into the rock units from greater depths, since vitrinite\nreflectance measurements show that the units never endured temperatures within\nthe thermogenic range.  Approximately 50 to 70 percent of the methane within\nthe gas hydrate units is thermogenic in origin.\n\n  This is U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 92-299\n\n  This report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity with U.S.\nGeological Survey editorial standards or with the North American Stratigraphic\nCode.
