    "description": "June 2018\nAd\u00e9lie penguin scats were collected from Signy Island (South Orkney Islands) during cr\u00e8che (December/January) 2014/15 and 2015/16 and stored in 80% Ethanol.  DNA was extracted from ~30 mg of faecal material using a Promega \u2018Maxwell 16' instrument and a Maxwell\u00ae 16 Tissue DNA kit. \nA total of 450 samples were analysed: 30 extractions per week for 2015 and 60 per week for samples collected in 2016.\n\nThree DNA markers providing different taxonomic information were amplified from penguin faecal DNA. First, ALL faecal DNA samples were characterised using a highly conserved metazoan primer set that amplifies a region of the nuclear 18S gene. In addition, a subset of faecal samples from each year were also characterised with two other primer pairs that amplify a region of the mtDNA 16S gene to allow species-level identification for most fish (16S_Fish) and krill (16S_Krill) species respectively. During amplification of markers, the products were tagged with a unique pair of index primers allowing samples to be pooled and sequenced (2x150bp) on a MiSeq high-throughput DNA sequencer. \n- See Adelie Pengiun Diet CCAMLR paper for all of the primer/PCR details\n- See BAS Adelie 18s Krill and Fish subset excel spreadsheet for sample details.\n- See BAS Adelie 18s ALL samples fastq for 18s fastq files\n- See BAS Adelie 16s Krill subset fastq for 16s krill fastq files\n- See BAS Adelie Fish subset fastq for 16s fish fastq files\n#####################################################################################\nNovember 2018\nIn addition we also amplified all 450 samples with the 16S_Fish marker.\n- See Adelie Experiment Details 16s Fish for sample details, plate layout, first and second round PCR and miseq sheet.\n- See BAS Adelie Fish ALL Samples fastq for 16s fish fastq files",
