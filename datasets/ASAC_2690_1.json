    "description": "Metadata record for data expected ASAC Project 2690\n\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n\nRelating ages, determined using the decay of radioactive elements in minerals, to geological events is central to understanding mountain building and continental evolution. This research will use carefully sampled rocks from Antarctica to improve current estimates of the distribution of elements that occur at only trace (parts per million) concentrations between the key mineral used in dating, zircon, and the common mineral garnet. This information will then be used to link zircon ages to the major events and processes that occurred during the assembly of ancient pieces of crust to form what is now East Antarctica, and other continents.\n\nAccessory mineral behaviour during partial melting in the crust - improving the geochronology of granulite terrains (ASAC_2690)\n\nThe aim of this project was to collect geological material appropriate for evaluating the chemical signatures of the minerals zircon, monazite and garnet formed during various stages of partial melting, melt accumulation and melt extraction in rocks undergoing deformation and metamorphism at high grades. A second objective was to collect gneisses in which the mineral record of early metamorphic events might be clarified in the complex Prydz Bay region.\n\nGeologists SL Harley, NM Kelly and T Hokada undertook field work over the period 21 December 2006 to 2 March 2007. Samples were collected by the usual techniques, using hammer and chisel, and documented in the field using sketches, photographs and GPS. \n\nSampling was complemented by detailed outcrop- and larger-scale mapping centred on defining the precise relationships between the rocks and mineral sites sampled.\n  \nLocalites / areas visited, mapped and sampled included the Larsemann Hills (Broknes Peninsula, Stornes Peninsula, McLeod Island, Manning  Island), Steinnes, the Brattstrand Bluffs coast, the Rauer Group (Torckler, Varyag, Tango, Pchelka, Lunnyy, Sapozhok Islands; Mather and Macey Peninsulas), and two subareas in the Vestfold Hills (Taynaya Bay, Pioneer Crossing).\n\nThe data set consists of an excel workbook containing three spreadsheets. The three spreadsheets provide listings of the  geological rock samples collected during the course of fieldwork by SL Harley, NM Kelly and T Hokada respectively. Each sheet provides sample numbers/codes, locations by name (and by code name if used in the collectors field notebook) and by latitude and longitude given in terms of degrees and decimalised minutes. Each sample is also described in terms of its mineralogy, some aspects of its structural or relational setting, and purpose for collection.\n\nSample numbers are described in the following way:  The letters are the initials of the collector (sh, TH, NK) and the sample number is usually of the form year/num e.g. 06/45.\n\nThe abbreviations used on the worksheets in the Excel spreadsheet are:\n\nHarley Sheet:\n\nCrd, Li-B: Li and B analysis of cordierite\nU-Pb, chem: geochemistry and U-Pb dating\nZrc-Mon: zircon and monazite phase and chemical relations\nP-T: pressure and temperature calculations\nP-T-Ky: pressure and temperature calculations and evaluation of relict kyanite \ncsil P-T-fluid: pressure, temperature and fluid composition  \ncalculations on calcsilicate mineral assemblage\n\nKelly sheet:\n\nAcc / Gx: accessory mineral behaviour and geochronology\nAcc / Grt comp: accessory mineral / garnet relations and REE distributions \nAcc / Min: mineralogy of complex accessory phases Grt REE comp: composition of garnet in terms of trace elements\nGx: geochronology\nAcc / Pet: petrology, pressure-temperature calculations and accessory mineral stability\nPet: petrology and pressure-temperature calculations\n\nKelly Mineral Assemblage abbreviations\n\nBt biotite\nCc calcite\nCpx clinopyroxene\nCrd cordierite\nDiop diopside\nFsp felsspar\nGrs grossular garnet\nGrt garnet\nHbl hornblende\nIlm ilmenite\nKfs K-feldspar\nKrn kornerupine / prismatine\nKy kyanite\nMnz monazite\nOpq opaque\nOpx orthopyroxene\nPl plagioclase\nQtz quartz\nScap scapolite\nSil sillimanite\nSpl spinel\nSpr sapphirine\nWoll wollastonite\nZrc zircon\n\nHokada sheet:\n\nU-Pb zrn: zircon U-Pb geochronology\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nSample Number\nLocation Name\nDate\nLocation Code\nLatitude\nLongitude\nField Description\nCollected For\nAdditional Notes",
