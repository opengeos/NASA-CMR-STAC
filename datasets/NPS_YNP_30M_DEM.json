    "description": "Digital Elevation Models are useful for deriving elevations;\nmodeling 3D surfaces; creating derived products such as\nslope, aspect, and relief layers; creating watersheds and\nconducting watershed analyses; and conducting other types of\nterrain analyses.\n\nDigital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology adopted by\nthe USGS to describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital\nraster form. The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m cell size, in a\nUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection) provides\ncoverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides\nthe same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle\nwithout over edge. The DEM data are stored as a series of\nprofiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and\nbetween each profile is in regular whole number intervals.The\nYellowstone National Park 30 m DEM was compiled from a\ncombination of of Level I and II USGS 30 m DEMs, elevation\nvalues range from 1528 to 4186, describing 1528 - 4186\nmeters.\n\nThe parkwide DEM was compiled by Lisa Landenburger,\nGeographic Information and Analysis Center (GIAC), Montana\nState University, Bozeman, MT.  This data set is unpublished.\nmaterial.\n\nThis summary was abstracted from the FGDC metadata file.",
