    "description": "This data set was created to document the original map (McGuire, V.L. and\nFischer, B.C., 1999) produced by the High Plains Water-Level Monitoring Project\nand to make available the data on this map for use with geographic information\nsystems.\n\nThis data set consists of digital water-level-change contours for the High\nPlains aquifer in the central United States, 1980 to 1997. The High Plains\naquifer extends from south of 32 degrees to almost 44 degrees north latitude\nand from 96 degrees 30 minutes to 104 degrees west longitude. The aquifer\nunderlies about 174,000 square miles in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,\nNew Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.\n\nThis digital data set was created from 5,233 wells measured in both 1980 and\n1997. The water-level-change contours were drawn manually on mylar at a scale\nof 1:1,000,000. The contours then were converted to a digital map.\n\nIntroduction --\n\nThe information provided in this introduction is found in U.S. Geological\nSurvey Professional Paper 1400-B (Gutentag and others, 1984). This data set\nconsists of digital water-level-change contours for the High Plains aquifer in\nthe United States, 1980 to 1997. The High Plains aquifer, which underlies about\n174,000 square miles in parts of eight states, is the principal water source in\none of the nation's major agricultural areas. In 1980, about 170,000 wells\npumped water from the aquifer to irrigate about 13 million acres.\n\nThe High Plains aquifer is a regional water-table aquifer consisting mostly of\nnear-surface sand-and-gravel deposits. In 1980, the maximum saturated thickness\nof the aquifer was about 1,000 feet and averaged about 200 feet. Hydraulic\nconductivity and specific yield of the aquifer depend on sediment types, which\nvary significantly both horizontally and vertically. Hydraulic conductivity\nranged from less than 25 to greater than 300 feet per day and averaged 60 feet\nper day. Specific yields ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent and averaged\nabout 15 percent.\n\nThe High Plains aquifer boundaries were determined by erosional extent of\nassociated geologic units and by hydraulic and physiographic boundaries where\nthe High Plains aquifer extends eastward from the Great Plains physiographic\nprovince (Fenneman, 1931). In most of the area, the erosional extent of the\nhydraulically connected Tertiary and Quaternary deposits were used as the\naquifer boundary. In eastern Nebraska, streams and physiographic boundaries\nwere used as the aquifer boundary.\n\nReviews Applied to Data --\n\nThis electronic report was subjected to the same review standards that apply to\nall U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers were asked to check the\ntopological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics,\nprojection, and geographic extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets for\nchecking against the source maps to verify the linework and attributes. The\nreviewers checked the metadata files for completeness and accuracy.",
