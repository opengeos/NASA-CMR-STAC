    "description": "The present-day observed change in sea level is the sum of several factors, including the continuing readjustment of the crust to the past redistribution of the surface ice-water load and any present-day melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. Constraints can be provided on both of these contributions by measuring the magnitude of the crustal rebound using the Global Positioning System. By combining the measurements with other estimates of sea-level change, it becomes possible to separate the two contributions. This will lead to both improved mass balance models for the ice-ocean system and improved understanding of present sea-level change.\n\nGPS Data:\n\nGPS data collected at sites near the Lambert Glacier. Ashtech Z-12 GPS receivers, 24 hr data files, 30 s sampling, 10 deg cutoff elevation, Ashtech cone-shaped radome used.\n\n1998\n----\n\nBeaver Lake (BVLK): days of year 012-083 (024 and 028 data corrupted)\n\n1999\n----\n\nBeaver Lake (BVLK): days of year 022-058.\n\n2000\n----\n\nBeaver Lake (BVLK):037-044, 308-331.\nDaltons Corner (DALT): 045-072.\nLanding Bluff (LDBF):  346-366.\n\n2001\n----\n\nBeaver Lake (BVLK): 008-028.\nDalton Corner (DALT):   008-026.\nLanding Bluff (LDBF):   001-108, 114, 123, 343-365.\n\n2002\n----\n\nBeaver Lake (BVLK): 006-082\nLanding Bluff (LDBF):   001\nDalton Corner (DALT):   started recording day 010.\n\n\nBVLK: 002,006-092,103,263-264,274\nLDBF: 001-107, 128-130,322-365\nDALT: 010-030,343-365\nKOMS (Komsomolskiy Peak): 362-365\n\n2003\n----\n\nBVLK: 001-102, 358-365\nLDBF: 001-104, 331-343\nDALT: 001-105, 260-306, 353-365\nKOMS: 001-108, 271-342\n\n2004\n----\n\nBVLK: 2004 data and archive report\nLDBF: 2004 data and archive report\nDALT: site not visited during last field season\nKOMS: site not visited during last field season\n\n2005\n----\n\nBVLK: 070-241\nDALT: 1101-1111, 2431-3261\nLDBF: 0011-3651\n\n2006\n----\n\nLDBF: 0011-3651\n\n2007\n----\n\nDALT: 0170-1120\nLDBF: 0011-0991\nRICH (Richardson Lake, Enderby Land): 0060-1290\n\n\nDiagnostic Data:\nThe diagnostic data are updated on a daily basis for those sites which have active satellite communication facilities.  For other sites, the data are only retrieved on an opportunistic basis as it has to be physically downloaded from the machine.  Diagnostic data are only available from 2000 onwards.\n\nDiagnostic data were collected at a test site, davi, located at Davis during 2000. The equipment was subsequently removed and redeployed in the PCMs after 2000. We did not install a GPS receiver at Davis; only diagnostic data were collected by the test installation.\n\nFurther information about the Richardson Lake site is available from the provided URL.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 1112 - Crustal rebound in the Lambert Glacier area.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nYear\nMonth\nDay\nHour\nMinute\nSecond\nBattery Voltages (bat1, bat2, bat3)\nSolar Panel Voltage switched across a 10 ohm resistor (pvp1, pvp2, pvp5)\nFuel Cell Input Voltage (no longer used)\nInternal Temperature (temp1, temp2, temp3)\nExternal Temperature (temp4)\nBattery Status (good, low, flat, sick, dead), connected to Fuel Cell (FC) - y/n\nHeater Status (on - y/n - if hibernating, shows hhh)\n  \nTaken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:\nPublic summary of the season progress:\nSuccessful automated operation of remote GPS installations in Antarctica and transmission of the data via satellite communications led to the accurate estimation of uplift rates at several sites in the Prince Charles Mountains and Enderby Land. These velocities help interpret mass balance changes as estimated from space gravity. The project was finalised and most equipment was removed. One site has not been visited since 2004 and the equipment still needs to be retrieved.",
