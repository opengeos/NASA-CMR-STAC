    "description": "Grounding Zone of the Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica defined by break of surface slope as determined through interpretation of MODIS images.  It defines the landward edge of the grounding zone and therefore the maximum extent of the ice shelf.\n\nThe MODIS data from the 250 m Channel 2 were processed to a reflectance product and remapped to a Polar Stereographic Projection.  The image contrast was stretched so that subtle variations in reflectance could be perceived.  The variation in reflectance was used as an indicator of variation in slope.  The break of slope of the snow surface was picked interactively on an image display at a frequency sufficient to define the shape of the grounding zone margin.  The series of points are provided as a Point shapefile file as well as a set of arcs connecting the points.  The point positions are given in geographic coordinates.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2224 and 3067 (ASAC_2224, ASAC_3067).",
