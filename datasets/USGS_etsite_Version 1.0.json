    "description": "The digital data set was created to display site locations at which\nmicrometeorological data were collected in Ash Meadows and Oasis Valley, Nev.\n\nThe digital data set provides locations and general descriptions of sites\ninstrumented to collect micrometeorological data from which mean annual ET\nrates were computed. Sites are located in Ash Meadows and Oasis Valley, Nevada.\nData were collected December 1993 through present.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe digital data set was created in cooperation with the U.S. Department of\nEnergy. The data set was created as part of a study to refine current estimates\nof ground-water discharge from the major discharge areas of the Death Valley\nregional flow system. This digital data set provides locations and general\ndescriptions of sites instrumented during recent studies of evapotranspiration\nin Ash Meadows and Oasis Valley, Nevada. Data were collected December 1993\nthrough 2001.\n\nReviews\n\nThe digital data set has gone through a multi-level, quality-control process to\nensure that the data are a reasonable representation of source points.\nReviewers were asked to check metadata and other documentation files for\ncompleteness and accuracy. Reviewers also were asked to check the topological\nconsistency, tolerances, projections, and geographic extent.\n\nNotes\n\nAny use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and\ndoes not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government. Although the data set has\nbeen used by the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior, no\nwarranty expressed or implied is made by the U.S. Geological Survey as to the\naccuracy of the data and related materials.\n\nAlthough this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata file is\nintended to document the data set in non-proprietary form, as well as in\nArcInfo format, this metadata file may include some ArcInfo-specific\nterminology.\n\nUsers should exercise caution and judgment in applying these data, and be aware\nthat errors may be present in any or all of the digital image data. If errors \nare encountered in this data set, it will be appreciated if the user would pass\nthis information to the Metadata_Contact.",
