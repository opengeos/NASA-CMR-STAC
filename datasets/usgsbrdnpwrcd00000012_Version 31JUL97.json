    "description": "Breeding bird populations in North Dakota were compared using surveys conducted\nin 1967 and 1992-93. In decreasing order, the five most frequently occurring\nspecies were Horned Lark (Eremophia alpestris), Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus\nater), Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius\nphoeniceus), and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus). The five most abundant\nspecies - Horned Lark, Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus),\nRed-winged Blackbird, Western Meadowlark, and Brown-headed Cowbird - accounted\nfor 31-41% of the estimated statewide breeding bird population in the three\nyears. Although species composition remained relatively similar among years,\nbetween-year patterns in abundance and frequency varied considerably among\nspecies. Data from this survey and the North American Breeding Bird Survey\nindicated that species exhibiting significant declines were primarily\ngrassland- and wetland-breeding birds, whereas species exhibiting significant\nincreases primarily were those associated with human structures and woody\nvegetation. Population declines and increases for species with similar habitat\nassociations paralleled breeding habitat changes, providing evidence that\nfactors on the breeding grounds are having a detectable effect on breeding\nbirds in the northern Great Plains.",
