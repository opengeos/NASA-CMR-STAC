    "description": "The ANARE Lambert Glacier Basin (LGB) series of oversnow traverses were conducted during the period 1989-95. Field operations were carried out along the proximity of the 2500 m elevation contour around the interior basin between Mawson and Davis stations. The main traverse route covered some 2014 km of track from LGB00 at 68.6543 S, 61.1201 E, and LGB72 at 69.9209 S, 76.4933 E. An offset route (50 km upslope) parallels the main traverse track around the western half of the basin. \n\nRaw data were stored in binary files containing pressure, temperature, navigational position and a variety of other parameters at an approximately 10 m spacing associated with each 2 km long section of track. Processed data were stored as 2 km averaged ice sheet surface elevation spreadsheet files (MS Excel). The data available at the url below are stored in various formats.\n\nSummary data (2 km spatial average) can be obtained from CRC Research Note No. 27 'Ice Thicknesses and Surface and Bedrock Elevations from the Lambert Glacier Basin Traverses 1989-95'.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 3 and 2216.",
