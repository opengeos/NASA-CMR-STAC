    "description": "This dataset contains measurements of nitrate in snow on the sea-ice.  These vertical nitrate profiles were collected from snow pits that were dug at each ice station during the SIPEX II voyage in 2012.  The snow depths range from 25-55 cm and snow samples were collected in 5 to 10 cm intervals from the snow surface to the top of the sea-ice.  The snow was then melted and passed through a resin to collect the nitrate.  The nitrate was then eluted with a strong NaCl solution and kept in bottles that were frozen at -20 degrees C.  The samples were shipped frozen back to Seattle where they will be analysed using an ion chromatograph.   The ion chromatograph outputs the data as text files.  \n\nAt this stage, samples have been collected but not analysed so no data currently exists.",
