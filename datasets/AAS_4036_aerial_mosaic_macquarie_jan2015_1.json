    "description": "A custom built flying wing (FX79 airframe) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was flown at approximately 120 metres above surface level over the isthmus at Macquarie Island on 31 January 2015. The isthmus is where the station is located. Attached to the UAV were a Canon EOS M camera and a GPS. \nHigh resolution aerial photographs were taken and a georeferenced mosiac of the photographs was later created using Pix4D software. The mosaic was not orthorectified.\nThe data includes the original georeferenced mosaic as a geotiff and a version that has been further georeferenced to the station WGS84 horizontal datum.\nThe pixel size is 1.3 centimetres.",
