    "description": "Since 1980 the  Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the  U.S. Geological\nSurvey and  Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection have conducted a\njoint program of cooperative geologic research in Long Island Sound and its\nvicinity. As part of this program, a highly successful regional-scale study of\ntheSeismic reflection acquisition illustration geologic framework was\ncompleted. Reconnaissance  high-resolution seismic reflection data were\ncollected and used to establish the basic stratigraphy within the Sound and to\nmap the major geologic units (Needell and Lewis, 1984; Lewis and Needell, 1987;\nNeedell and others, 1987); field verification of the geologic interpretations\nof the seismic profiles was primarily accomplished with  vibratory cores\n(Williams, 1981;  Thomas, 1985;  Neff and others, 1989). These interpretations\nwere in turn used to produce basin-wide syntheses of the late Quaternary\ndepositional history (Lewis and Stone, 1991; Stone and others, 1998; Lewis and\nDiGiacomo-Cohen, 2000).\n\nUnfortunately, the original seismic records and core logs were generated only\nin analog form. These unique paper documents, which are still under demand for\nindustrial applications and academic research, are fragile and have become\nragged from frequent use. The purpose of this report is to preserve these data\nby converting the seismic profiles, core descriptions, and ancillary reports\ninto digital form, and to organize these files into a product that can be more\nreadily accessed and disseminated. \n\nNot all of the existing high-resolution seismic-reflection surveys, collected\nin Long Island Sound through cooperatives with the U.S. Geological Survey and\nthe Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, have been incorporated\ninto this report. These surveys, whose records are still in need of\npreprocessing and annotation, generally cover smaller areas along the\nConnecticut coast and were originally intended to provide additional detail to\nthe larger, more regional data sets presented herein. The digital release of\nthe omitted data sets is planned as part of a future product.",
