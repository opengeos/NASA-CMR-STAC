    "description": "This report contains major- and trace-element concentration data for soil\nsamples collected from 265 sites along two continental-scale transects in North\nAmerica. One of the transects extends from northern Manitoba to the United\nStates-Mexico border near El Paso, Tex. and consists of 105 sites. The other\ntransect approximately follows the 38th parallel from the Pacific coast of the\nUnited States near San Francisco, Calif., to the Atlantic coast along the\nMaryland shore and consists of 160 sites. Sampling sites were defined by first\ndividing each transect into approximately 40-km segments. For each segment, a\n1-km-wide latitudinal strip was randomly selected; within each strip, a\npotential sample site was selected from the most representative landscape\nwithin the most common soil type. At one in four sites, duplicate samples were\ncollected 10 meters apart to estimate local spatial variability. At each site,\nup to four separate soil samples were collected as follows: (1) material from\n0-5 cm depth; (2) O horizon, if present; (3) a composite of the A horizon; and\n(4) C horizon. Each sample collected was analyzed for total major- and\ntrace-element composition by the following methods: (1) inductively coupled\nplasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic\nemission spectrometry (ICPAES) for aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barium,\nberyllium, bismuth, cadmium, calcium, cerium, cesium, chromium, cobalt, copper,\ngallium, indium, iron, lanthanum, lead, lithium, magnesium, manganese,\nmolybdenum, nickel, niobium, phosphorus, potassium, rubidium, scandium, silver,\nsodium, strontium, sulfur, tellurium, thallium, thorium, tin, titanium,\n\ntungsten, uranium, vanadium, yttrium, and zinc; (2) cold vapor- atomic\nabsorption spectrometry for mercury; (3) hydride generation-atomic absorption\nspectrometry for antimony and selenium; (4) coulometric titration for carbonate\ncarbon; and (5) combustion for total carbon and total sulfur.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
