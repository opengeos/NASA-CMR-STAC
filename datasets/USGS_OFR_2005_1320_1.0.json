    "description": "The overall goal of our research on Bear Lake is to obtain records of past\nclimate change for the region, including changes in precipitation (rain and\nsnow) patterns during the last 10,000 years and longer. As part of the project,\nwe are attempting to determine how the size of Bear Lake has varied in the past\nin order to assess the possibility of future flooding and drought. We also seek\nto understand human influences on sediment deposition, chemistry, and life in\nthe lake.\n\nEvidence of past environmental conditions comes from sediments deposited in the\nlake, so reconstructions of these conditions require accurate dating of the\nsediments. The study includes the upper Bear River watershed as well as Bear\nLake. The Bear River is the largest river in the Great Basin and the source of\nthe majority of water flowing into the Great Salt Lake. In this region, wet\nperiods may produce flooding along the course of the Bear River and around\nGreat Salt Lake, while dry periods, or droughts, may affect water availability\nfor ecosystems, as well as for agricultural, industrial, and residential use.\n\nHere we report the results of radiocarbon analyses of sediments in several\ncores from Bear Lake and compare the radiocarbon ages with independently\nestimated ages derived from amino acid analyses in ostracodes. We develop age\nmodels for each core to form the chronological framework for other\npaleoenvironmental studies.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
