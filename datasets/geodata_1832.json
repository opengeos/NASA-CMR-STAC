    "description": "Primary Forest is a forest where  there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed and composed of indigenous trees, and not classified as forest  plantation\n\nModified natural forest/other wooded land of naturally regenerated native species where there are clearly visible indications of human activities. Includes, but is not limited to selectively logged-over areas, areas naturally regenerating following agricultural land use, areas recovering from human included fires\u2026 Includes areas where it is not possible to distinguish whether the regeneration has been natural or assisted.\n\nForest plantation and natural forests are included in the term forest, a term that refers to land with a tree cover of more than 10 percent and area of more than 0.5 ha. Forests are determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 m. Young stands that have not yet reached, but are expected to reach, a crown density of 10m percent and tree height of 5 m are included under forest, as are temporarily unstocked areas. The term includes forests used for purposes of production, protection, multiple use or conservation (i.e. forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas), as well as forest stands on agricultural lands (e.g. windbreaks and shelterbelts of trees with a width of more than 20 m) and rubberwood plantations and cork oak stands. The term specifically excludes stands of trees established primarily for agricultural production, for example fruit tree plantations. It also excludes trees planted in agroforestry systems.",
