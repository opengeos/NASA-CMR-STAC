    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 1212.\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nThis project aims to improve ship-based sea-ice thickness measurements made using an electromagnetic induction device by performing a theoretical analysis of the sensitivity of the electromagnetic instrument to factors such as instrument height and orientation, ice conductivity and thickness, and seawater conductivity. The results of the theoretical study will be used to assist the interpretation of an existing sea-ice thickness data set from the Mertz Glacier polynya cruise (V1, 1999/2000). \n\nThe data set consists of the results of numerical modelling of the response of the EM31 electromagnetic instrument to typical one- and three-dimensional sea ice structures.  One-dimensional model calculations were performed using software written specifically for the project.  Three-dimensional model calculations were performed using Marco_air version 2.3, written by Z. Xiong and A. Raiche, CSIRO Mathematical Geophysics Group.  Technical descriptions of this program are given in the preceding References section.\n\nThe download file below contains some numerical output from the models, as well as a detailed description of the models used.",
