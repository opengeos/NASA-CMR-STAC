    "description": "R scripts and demonstration data for end-member mixing and splitting: using isotopes and other tracers to determine where streamflow comes from (end-member mixing) and where precipitation goes (end-member splitting).      # This package includes two R scripts: #    \"EndSplit_v1.0_20200516.R\" implements end-member mixing and splitting.   \"EndSplit_demo_v1.0_20200516.R\" demonstrates the application of EndSplit to the Hubbard Brook Watershed 3 isotope data set (see below).    Both of these scripts are copyright (C) 2020 ETH Zurich and James Kirchner.

Users are solely responsible for determining the suitability and reliability of this software for their own purposes.    These scripts implement end-member mixing and end-member splitting, as described in Kirchner and Allen, \"Seasonal partitioning of precipitation between streamflow and evapotranspiration, inferred from end-member splitting analysis\", Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 24, 17-39, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-17-2020, 2020.  Users publishing results based on these scripts should cite that paper.    Build 2020.05.16 is a minor bug fix of build 2019.10.25, which was previously released as EndSplit_v1.0_20191025.R.    # The zip file \"demonstration input data.zip\" contains 8 demonstration data files (all tab-delimited text): #    \"Hubbard Brook WS3 isotope data split by sampling date.txt\" contains streamflow and precipitation isotope data from Hubbard Brook Watershed 3 isotope data (Campbell and Green, 2019).  \"Hubbard Brook WS3 daily P and Q 1956-2014.txt\" contains daily precipitation and streamflow totals for Hubbard Brook Watershed 3.  (USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, 2016a and 2016b).    \"Hubbard Brook WS3 isotope data WY2007.txt\", \"Hubbard Brook WS3 isotope data WY2008.txt\", \"Hubbard Brook WS3 isotope data WY2009.txt\", \"Hubbard Brook WS3 daily P and Q WY2007.txt\", \"Hubbard Brook WS3 daily P and Q WY2008.txt\", and \"Hubbard Brook WS3 daily P and Q WY2009.txt\" contain subsets of these data for the designated water years.      As the work product of US federal employees, the data in these files are in the public domain.  However, any users of these data should cite the original sources:    Campbell, J. L., and Green, M.
