    "description": "This data set was collected during an ocean acidification mesocosm experiment performed at Davis Station, Antarctica during the 2014/15 summer season. It includes:\n- description of methods for all data collection and analyses.\n- diatom cell volume\n- bulk silicification\n- species specific silicification via fluorescence microscopy\n- bulk community Fv/Fm on day 12\n- single-cell PAM fluorometry data (maximum quantum yield of PSII: Fv/Fm)\n\nA natural community of Antarctic marine microbes from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica were exposed to a range of CO2 concentrations in 650 L minicosms to simulate possible future ocean conditions up to the year ~2200. Diatom silica precipitation rates were examined at CO2 concentrations between 343 to 1641 micro atm, measuring both the total diatom community response and that of individual species, to determine whether ocean acidification may influence future diatom ballast and therefore alter carbon and silica fluxes in the Southern Ocean.\n\nDescribed and analysed in:\nAntarctic diatom silicification diminishes under ocean acidification (submitted for review)\t\n\t\nMethods described in:\t\nAntarctic diatom silicification diminishes under ocean acidification (submitted for review)\t\n\t\nLocation: Prydz bay, Davis Station, Antarctica (68 degrees 35'S, 77 degrees 58' E) \nDate: Summer 2014/2015\n\nWorksheet descriptions:\t\n\t\nBulk silicification - raw data\t\nMeasured total and incorporated biogenic silica using spectrophotometer for all tanks on day 12 after 24 h incubation with PDMPO - raw data\t\n\t\nBulk Fv/Fm - dark-adapted maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) on whole community - raw data\t\nMeasured Fv/Fm of individual cells from 3 mesocosm tanks.\t\n\t\nSingle-cell silicificiation, Fluorescence microscopy  - raw data\t\nMeasured autofluorescence and PDMPO fluorescence of individual diatoms from 6 mesocosm tanks \t\n\t\nSingle-cell PAM, dark-adapted maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) - raw data\t\nMeasured Fv/Fm of individual cells from 3 mesocosm tanks.\t\n\t\nCell volume\t\nCalculated cell volume (um3) of 7 species from minicosm tanks 1 and 6 - raw data\t\n\t\n\t\nAbbreviations:\t\nFv/Fm\tMaximum quantum yield of PSII\nPDMPO\t2-(4-pyridyl)-5-((4-(2-dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl)methoxy)phenyl)oxazole \nTant\tThalassiosira antarctica\nDiscLg\tLarge Discoid centric diatoms\nStella\tStellarima microtrias\nChaeto\tChaetoceros spp.\nProb\tProboscia truncata\nPseu\tPseudonitzschia turgiduloides\nFragLg\tFragilariopsis cylindrus / curta\nCentric \tLarge Discoid centric diatoms\nLargeThalassiosira\tLarge Discoid centric diatoms",
