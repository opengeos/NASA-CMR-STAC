    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) Version 1 product provides NBAR estimates at 1 kilometer (km) resolution. The VNP43DNB4 product is produced daily using 16 days of VIIRS data and is weighted temporally to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The view angle effects are removed from the directional reflectances resulting in a stable and consistent NBAR product. The VNP43 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo product suite.\n\nThe VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from [VNP43DNBA1](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43DNBA1.001) to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry [VNP43DNBA4](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43DNBA4.001), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) ([VNP43DNBA3](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43DNBA3.001)). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle. Likewise, both the BSA and WSA Science Dataset (SDS) layers can be used with a simple polynomial to manually estimate instantaneous actual albedo (blue-sky albedo). Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). \n\nThe VNP43DNBA4 product includes BRDF/Albedo mandatory quality and nadir reflectance for the VIIRS DNB. A low-resolution browse image is also available showing NBAR of the DNB as a red, green, blue (RGB) image in JPEG format.\n\nKnown Issues\n* The abnormally high activation of the high aerosol flag in the Collection 1 (C1) VNP09 product has impacted downstream products. The VNP43 BRDF/Albedo/NBAR product is affected by reducing the number of otherwise acceptable observations used as input to characterize surface anisotropy. This effect (most obvious over arid bright surfaces) results in a reduced number of high quality full BRDF model inversions. Therefore, users should be aware that bright arid surfaces (normally associated with high quality BRDF/Albedo/NBAR retrievals) are likely to be somewhat represented by lower quality results in C1. VNP09 has been corrected for Collection 2 (C2). Therefore, users should avoid substantive use of C1 VNP43 over arid regions (and wait for C2 products). In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in VNP43[I-M]A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QA provided as part of the VNP43[I-M]A1, 3 and 4 products.\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=VIIRS).",
