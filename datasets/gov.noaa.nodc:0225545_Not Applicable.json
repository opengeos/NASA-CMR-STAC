    "description": "This dataset contains the bulk density and pore water, sediment texture and composition data from sediment cores collected aboard R/V Weatherbird II cruises WB-0812 and WB-0813 in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) from 2012-08-14 to 2013-08-21. These data were generated for selected core sub-samples at 2mm sampling intervals for \u00e2\u0080\u009csurficial unit\u00e2\u0080\u009d and 5mm sampling resolution intervals to the base of cores. For the bulk density and pore water data, sediment cores were collected on board the R/V Weatherbird II cruise WB-0812 in the nGoM from 2012-08-14 to 2012-08-16. It reports measurement of sediment sample wet weight (g), dry weight (g) and percent pore water. Bulk density is the dry weight per sampling volume expressed as g/cm3. Whereas, sediment texture and composition data were collected aboard R/V Weatherbird II cruise WB-0813 in the nGoM from 2013-08-20 to 2013-08-21. Sediment texture values were expressed as percent gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Percent of mud can be calculated by combining percent silt and clay. Sediment composition was expressed as percent total organic matter (TOM) measured by loss on ignition (LOI), percent carbonate content measured by acid leaching, and the percent insoluble residue (IR), which was likely dominated by terrigenous clastic (land-derived) sediment sources.",
