    "description": "The NARSTO_EPA_SS_HOUSTON_TEXAQS2000_WB_TUNNEL data contain gas and particle phase measurements collected in a tunnel in the Houston area during the summer of 2000. The primary objective of this study was to provide data for estimating vehicular emission factors and composition profiles as part of the TexAQS2000 program. Measurements were collected on each day from August 29, 2000 (Tuesday) through September 1, 2000 (Friday). Sampling was conducted during the 1200 - 1400 CDT and 1600 - 1800 CDT time periods each day. Measurements collected during the study included nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and individual hydrocarbon species.The Houston Supersite is one of several Supersites that was established in urban areas within the United States by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to better understand the measurement, sources, and health effects of suspended particulate matter (PM). The overall goals were to characterize the composition and identify the sources of particulate matter in Southeastern Texas, to develop and test new methods for characterizing fine particulate matter, and to collect data on the physical and chemical characterization of fine particulate matter that can be used to support exposure and health effects studies.NARSTO (formerly North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone) is a public/private partnership, whose membership spans government, the utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission is to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are available.",
