    "description": "Oceanographic data were collected on Aurora Australis Voyage 4 2003/2004, from December 2003 to February 2004, and a calibrated data set was created. The oceanographic program on the voyage was a part of the cruise-determining fish survey in the vicinity of Heard Island. A total of 42 CTD vertical profile stations were taken, most to within 5 m of the bottom. Over 450 Niskin bottle samples were collected and analysed on board, for calibration of the CTD conductivity sensors. Nutrient samples were also collected, but not analysed. Near surface current data were collected using a ship mounted ADCP. Data from the array of ship's underway sensors are included in the data set.\n\nThe data report describes the processing/calibration of the CTD and ADCP data, and gives important details concerning data quality. An offset correction was derived for the underway sea surface temperature and salinity data, by comparison with near surface CTD data.\n\nThese data form part of the overall dataset for ASAC project 2388 (ASAC_2388).",
