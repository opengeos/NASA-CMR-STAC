    "description": "Location:  Ice camp on perennial sea ice in the southwestern corner of the Weddell Sea, Antarctic\n\nThe first direct radiative and turbulent surface flux measurements ever made over floating Antarctic sea ice.  The data are from Ice Station Weddell as it drifted in the western Weddell Sea from February to late May 1992.\n\nData Types:\n\nHourly measurements of the turbulent surface fluxes of momentum and sensible and latent heat by eddy covariance at a height of 4.65 m above snow-covered sea ice.  Instruments were a 3-axis sonic anemometer/thermometer and a Lyman-alpha hygrometer.\n\nHourly, surface-level measurements of the four radiation components:  in-coming and out-going longwave and shortwave radiation.  Instruments were hemispherical pyranometers and pyrgeometers.\n\nHourly mean values of standard meteorological variables:  air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, surface temperature.  Instruments were a propeller-vane for wind speed and direction and cooled-mirror dew-point hygrometers and platinum resistance thermometers for dew-points and temperatures.  Surface temperature came from a Barnes PRT-5 infrared thermometer.\n\nFlux Data\nThe entire data kit is bundled as a zip file named ISW_Flux_Data.zip\nThe main data file is comma delimited.\nThe README file is ASCII.\nThe associated reprints of publications are in pdf.\n\nRadiosounding data:  On Ice Station Weddell, typically twice a day from 21 February through 4 June 1992 made with both tethered (i.e., only boundary-layer profiles) and (more rarely) free-flying sondes that did not measure wind speed.  (168 soundings).\n\nISW Radiosoundings\nThe entire data kit is bundled as a zip file named ISW_Radiosounding.zip.\nThe README file is in ASCII.\nTwo summary files that include the list of sounding and the declinations are in ASCII.\nThe 168 individual sounding files are in ASCII.\nTwo supporting publications that describe the data and some analyses are in pdf.\n\nRadiosounding data collected from the Russian ship Akademic Fedorov from 26 May through 5 June 1992 at 6-hourly intervals as it approached Ice Station Weddell from the north.  These soundings include wind vector, temperature, humidity, and pressure.  (40 soundings)\n\nAkademic Federov Radiosoundings\nThe entire data kit is bundled as a zip file named Akad_Federov_Radiosounding.zip.\nThe README file is in ASCII.\nA summary file that lists the soundings is in ASCII.\nThe 40 individual sounding files are in ASCII.\nTwo supporting publications that describe the data and some analyses are in pdf.\n\n\nDocumentation:\n\nAndreas, E.
