    "description": "Vegetation field plots at Congaree Swamp National Monument were visited,\ndescribed, and documented in a digital database. The database consists of 2\nparts - (1) Physical Descriptive Data, and (2) Species Listings.\n\nThe vegetation plots were used to describe the vegetation in and around\nCongaree Swamp National Monument and to assist in developing a final mapping\nclassification system.\n\nOn June 30, 1983, Congaree Swamp National Monument became an International\nBiosphere Reserve. Congaree is noted for containing one of the last significant\nstands of old growth bottomland hardwood forest, over 11,000 acres in all. The\nMonument contains over 90 species of trees, 16 of which hold state records for\nsize. Included in this list of records is a national record sweet gum with a\nbasal circumference of nearly 20 feet.\n\nCongaree Swamp National Monument is located approximately 15 miles southeast of\nColumbia, the state capitol of South Carolina. Old Bluff Highway (old Highway\n48) lies just north of the Monument boundary. The eastern boundary is located\njust northwest of the confluence of the Congaree and Wateree Rivers. The\nMonument extends west to where Cedar Creek and Myers Creek join.\n\nThe methods used for the sampling and analysis of vegetation data and the\ndevelopment of the classification generally followed the standards Doutline in\nthe Field Methods for Vegetation Mapping document\n\"http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/fieldmethods/index.html\" produced for the\nUSGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping project. This process began with the development of\na provisional list of twenty-five vegetation types from teh International\nClassification of Ecological Communities (ICEC) that were thought to have a\nhigh likelihood of being in the park based on an initial field visit on 13-14\nJune, 1996.\n\nOne hundred twenty-eight plots were sampled by two two-person field teams in\nJuly, August, and September of 1996. In a devation from the methodology\noutlined in the Field Methods document, initial sample points were selected in\norder to have plots in each of the aerial photograph signature types. The\ngradsect approach was rejected because there appeared to be no potential for\nstratifying sampling of the park based on slope, aspect, elevation, soil or\nother natural features due to a lack of available information. Furthermore,\nbecause of isolation from roads and trails of many portions of the park, it was\ndeemed not feasible to use a transect to establish plot locations. After\nsampling, plots were tentatively assigned to the ICEC at the alliance level and\nour goal was to have at least five plots in each of the twenty-five provisional\nvegetation types. TIme limitations precluded the ability of the field teams to\ninstall ten plots in each of the expected vegetation types as recommended in\nthe Field Methods document.\n\nThe information for the metadata came from\n\"http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/cosw/metacoswfield.html\"",
