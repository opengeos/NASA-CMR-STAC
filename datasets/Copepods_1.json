    "description": "This dataset contains samples collected at O'Gorman Rocks and Ellis Fjord near Davis station from December 1997 to March 1998. Depth-stratified zooplankton samples were obtained for determination of zooplankton abundance and biomass. Water samples were collected for the determination of chlorophyll a concentration, protist identification and abundance, and the concentration of particulate and dissolved organic carbon. Sediment trap material was collected for the analysis of faecal pellets (identification and CHN analyses), protist identification and abundance, and the measurement of particulate organic carbon concentration. Zooplankton grazing experiments were performed in the laboratory at Davis station and zooplankton were also collected for CHN analyses. Data from this project arose from projects ASAC 963 and ASAC 2229.",
