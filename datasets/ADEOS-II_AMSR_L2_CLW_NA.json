    "description": "ADEOS-II/AMSR L2 Cloud Liquid Water dataset is obtained from the AMSR sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) was launched on December 14, 2002 (Japanese Standard Time). The objective of ADEOS-II was to acquire data to contribute to international global climate change research, as well as for applications such as meteorology and fishery.AMSR observes various physical contents concerning to water (H2O) by receiving weak microwaves naturally radiated from the Earth's surface and atmosphere and also regardless of day or night, the presence of clouds. Those sensors aim at collecting global data for mainly understanding the circulation of water and energy.Level 2 product stores the Geophysical quantity from the brightness temperature of level 1 product.This product includes cloud liquid water (CLW). CLW is calculated from brightness temperature of 10 channels (5frequencies X 2 polarization) by using a Linear Statistical Regression (LSR) algorithm. In this processing, a combination of coefficients is utilized and these are specified in accordance with a simulation in which brightness temperatures for a wide variety of ocean scenes (sea surface temperature, wind speed, water vapor and cloud liquid water) are computed by the Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). These coefficients were found such that the rms difference between estimated value and the true value for the specified environmental scene was minimized If the value of cloud liquid water is above 0.18 mm, it flags the observation as having rain. The physical quantity unit is kg/m^2.The provided format is HDF4. Spatial resolution is 10 km. The current version of the product is \"Version 7\". The generation unit is scene (defined as a half orbit).",
