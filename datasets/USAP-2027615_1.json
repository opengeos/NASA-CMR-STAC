    "description": "This project will develop a new ice-penetrating radar system that can simultaneously map glacier geometry and glacier flow along repeat profiles. Forecasting an ice-sheet\u2019s contribution to sea level requires an estimate for the initial ice-sheet geometry and the parameters that govern ice flow and slip across bedrock. Existing ice-sheet models cannot independently determine this information from conventional observations of ice-surface velocities and glacier geometry. This introduces substantial uncertainty into simulations of past and future ice-sheet behavior. Thus, this new radar capability is conceived to provide the needed data to support higher-fidelity simulations of past and future ice-sheet behavior and more accurate projections of future sea level.    The new radar system will integrate two existing radars (the multi-channel coherent radio-echo depth sounder and the accumulation radar) developed by the Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets, as well as adding new capabilities.  An eight-element very high frequency (VHF; 140-215 MHz) array will have sufficient cross-track aperture to swath map internal layers and the ice-sheet base in three dimensions. A single ultra high frequency (UHF; 600-900 MHz) antenna will have the range and phase resolution to map internal layer displacement with 0.25-mm precision. The VHF array will create 3D mappings of layer geometry that enable measurements of vertical velocities by accounting for spatial offsets between repeat profiles and changing surface conditions. The vertical displacement measurement will then be made by determining the difference in radar phase response recorded by the UHF antenna for radar profiles collected at the same locations at different times. The UHF antenna will be dual-polarized and thus capable of isolating both components of complex internal reflections.  This should enable inferences of ice crystal orientation fabric and widespread mapping of ice viscosity. Initial field testing of the radar will occur on the McMurdo Ice Shelf and then progress to Thwaites Glacier, Antarctica. The dual-band radar system technology and processing algorithms will be developed with versatile extensible hardware and user-friendly software so that this system will serve as a prototype for a future community radar system.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
