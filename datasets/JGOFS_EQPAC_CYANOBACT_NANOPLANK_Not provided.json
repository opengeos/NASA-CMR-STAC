    "description": "The Equatorial Pacific Process Study (EQPAC) was conducted along 140 deg W\n            longitude during 1992.\n            \n            Four cruises took place: February 3 - March 9, March 19 - April 15,\n            August 5 - September 18, and September 24 - October 21.  A fifth benthic\n            cruise and sediment trap legs were added.  During the first cruise\n            (TT007), 15 stations were occupied along 140 deg W longitude from\n            12 deg N latitude to 12 deg S latitude.  During the second cruise\n            (TT008), data were collected at 8 stations along 140 deg W longitude\n            from 9 deg S latitude to 9 deg N latitude.  During the third cruise\n            (TT011), data were collected at 15 stations along 140 deg W from 12 deg N\n            latitude to 12 deg S latitude.  During the fourth cruise (TT012), data were\n            collected at 5 stations along 140 deg W longitude from 17 deg S\n            latitude to the equator.\n            \n            Abundance, biovolume and biomass of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic\n            plankton were measured at each station in vertical profiles using the CTD\n            rosette water sampler.  The cyanobacteria and plankton were enumerated and\n            sized using color image analyzed fluorescence microscopy.  The following\n            parameters were measured:\n            abundance of synechococcus-type cyanobacteria\n            biovolume of synechococcus-type cyanobacteria\n            biomass of synechococcus-type cyanobacteria\n            abundance of phototrophic eucaryotic pico- and nanoplankton\n            biovolume of phototrophic eucaryotic pico- and nanoplankton\n            biomass of phototropic eucaryotic pico- and nanoplankton\n            abundance of heterotrophic eucaryotic pico- and nanoplankton\n            biovolume of heterotrophic eucaryotic pico- and nanoplankton\n            biomass of heterotrophic eucaryotic pico- and nanoplankton\n            \n            The abundances are in units of cells/liter; the biovolumes are in\n            units of cubic micrometers; and the biomasses are in units of\n            micrograms of carbon per liter.\n            \n            The data is public domain and can be retrieved on-line at\n            \"http://usjgofs.whoi.edu/jg/dir/jgofs/\"\n            \n            [The information in this summary was derived from the JGOFS\n            World Wide Web pages.]",
