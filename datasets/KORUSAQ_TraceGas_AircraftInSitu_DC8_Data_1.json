    "description": "KORUSAQ_TraceGas_AircraftInSitu_DC8_Data are in-situ trace gas data collected onboard the DC-8 aircraft during the KORUS-AQ field campaign. Data were collected using a variety of instrumentation, including 4STAR, DACOM, PTR-ToF-MS, CIT-ToF-CIMS, TD-LIF, and ATHOS. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe KORUS-AQ field study was conducted in South Korea during May-June, 2016. The study was jointly sponsored by NASA and Korea\u2019s National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER). The primary objectives were to investigate the factors controlling air quality in Korea (e.g., local emissions, chemical processes, and transboundary transport) and to assess future air quality observing strategies incorporating geostationary satellite observations. To achieve these science objectives, KORUS-AQ adopted a highly coordinated sampling strategy involved surface and airborne measurements including both in-situ and remote sensing instruments.\r\n\r\nSurface observations provided details on ground-level air quality conditions while airborne sampling provided an assessment of conditions aloft relevant to satellite observations and necessary to understand the role of emissions, chemistry, and dynamics in determining air quality outcomes. The sampling region covers the South Korean peninsula and surrounding waters with a primary focus on the Seoul Metropolitan Area. Airborne sampling was primarily conducted from near surface to about 8 km with extensive profiling to characterize the vertical distribution of pollutants and their precursors. The airborne observational data were collected from three aircraft platforms: the NASA DC-8, NASA B-200, and Hanseo King Air. Surface measurements were conducted from 16 ground sites and 2 ships: R/V Onnuri and R/V Jang Mok.\r\n\r\nThe major data products collected from both the ground and air include in-situ measurements of trace gases (e.g., ozone, reactive nitrogen species, carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, non-methane and oxygenated hydrocarbon species), aerosols (e.g., microphysical and optical properties and chemical composition), active remote sensing of ozone and aerosols, and passive remote sensing of NO2, CH2O, and O3 column densities. These data products support research focused on examining the impact of photochemistry and transport on ozone and aerosols, evaluating emissions inventories, and assessing the potential use of satellite observations in air quality studies.",
