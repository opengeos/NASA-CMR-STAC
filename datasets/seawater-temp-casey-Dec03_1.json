    "description": "Water temperatures were recorded by Tidbit temperature loggers attached to experimental mesocosms suspended below the sea ice at four sites around Casey in summer 2003/04. Data are temperature in degrees Celsius automatically logged every 5 minutes between the 01/12/2003 and 31/12/2003 at Brown Bay inner (S66 16.811 E110 32.475) and McGrady Cove (S66 16.556 E110 34.392), and between 02/12/2003 and 01/01/2004 at Brown Bay outer (S66 16.811 E110 32.526) and O'Brien Bay (S66 18.730 E110 30.810). Three loggers were deployed at each site; loggers A and B - one attached to each of two mesocosms (perforated 20 litre food buckets) and another - logger I - attached to plastic tubing approximately 1 metre above the mesocosms. Only two data loggers (A and B) were deployed at Mcgrady Cove. Mesocosms were suspended two to three metres below the bottom edge of the sea ice through a 1 metre diameter hole and were periodically raised to the surface for short periods (~1 hour). This experiment was part of the short-term biomonitoring program for the Thala Valley Tip Clean-up at Casey during summer 2003/04.\n\nThese data were collected as part of ASAC project 2201 (ASAC_2201 - Natural variability and human induced change in Antarctic nearshore marine benthic communities).\n\nSee also other metadata records by Glenn Johnstone for related information.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nDate\nTime\nTemperature\nLocation",
