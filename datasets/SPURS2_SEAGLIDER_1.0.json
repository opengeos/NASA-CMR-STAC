    "description": "The SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) project is a NASA-funded oceanographic process study and associated field program that aim to elucidate key mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the oceans. The project is comprised of two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes. SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D, SMAP and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales. The SPURS-2 campaign involved two month-long cruises by the R/V Revelle in August 2016 and October 2017 combined with complementary sampling on a more continuous basis over this period by the schooner Lady Amber. Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. The Seaglider is an autonomous profiler measuring salinity and temperature. A total of five Seagliders were deployed over the two SPURS2 cruises. Three Seagliders were deployed on the first Revelle cruise in August 2016, recovered by the Lady Amber after 7 months and redeployed, to be retrieved finally during the second cruise in November 2017. One of the Seagliders was deployed alongside and tracked the Lagrangian array across the study region, diving to depths of 1000m. All Seaglider data files are in netCDF format with standards compliant metadata.",
