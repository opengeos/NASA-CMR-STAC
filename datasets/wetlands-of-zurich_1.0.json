    "description": "This dataset includes data on species richness of vascular plants and bryophytes in 55 wetlands of the canton of Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland) as well as recent and historic data on the area and connectivity of these 55 wetlands and was used for the paper Jamin A., Peintinger M., Gimmi U., Holderegger R., Bergamini A. (2020) Evidence for a possible extinction debt in Swiss wetland specialist plants. Ecology and Evolution.  Species richness data are available for vascular plants and bryophytes. The field survey was carried out between June 5 and August 10, 2012. The survey covered all wetland (fen) types in the canton of Z\u00fcrich. For data collection, at least half a day per wetland was spent searching for species. Within each wetland all different vegetation types were covered until no new species were found to get as complete species lists as possible. In the Excel file information on species richness of the following groups is provided: (1) all vascular plant species; (2) wetlands specialists among vascular plants; (3) generalists, which were all non-specialist vascular plant species; (4) short-lived vascular plant specialists; (5) long-lived vascular plant specialists; (6) short-lived vascular plant generalists; (7) long-lived vascular plant generalists; (8) bryophyte species. Specialist vascular plant species included all characteristic species listed in Appendix 1a of the wetland inventory of Switzerland (BUWAL, 1990).   Based on the data of Gimmi et al. (2011), the area of all wetlands in 1850, 1900, 1950 and 2000 were determined as well as the wetland area within buffers 2km in radius with the center of the wetland as starting point. These data are also provided in the Excel sheet.  Moreover, for each wetland mean indicator values according to Landolt et al. (2010) and the standard deviation of these indicator values based on presence-absence data of vascular plants were calculated and are provided in Excel sheet. Indicator values for temperature, light availability, moisture, acidity, nutrients, amount of humus and soil aeration were considered.",
