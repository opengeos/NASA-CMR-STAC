    "description": "Most probable number counts of bacteria in sediment samples from the Sediment Recruitment Experiment 4. Samples were taken immediately after the collection of sediment, after the addition of the oils to the sediment and after five years in situ incubation in O'Brien Bay near Casey station in the Windmill Islands region of Antarctica.\n\nSediment was treated by the addition of oil (four different types: synthetic lubricant, used synthetic lubricant, biodegradable lubricant and special antarctic blend diesel) and the number of bacteria able to degrade components of Special Antarctic Blend diesel (SAB) was determined using an MPN method on a marine mineral medium with Special Antarctic Blend diesel as sole carbon source.\n\nThe total number of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria present was also estimated for the control and SAB treatments using marine medium 2216 from Bacto.\n\nData are presented as the most-probable-number of bacteria per gram of wet sediment.\n\nSee also the metadata record 'SRE4_hydrocarbondegrading_MPN_2001'.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2201 and 2672 (ASAC_2201, ASAC_2672).\n\nMore information about the dataset is presented on the summary worksheet of the download file - this information is copied below:\n\n4 -tube Most probable number counts were carried out on sediment samples from the SRE4 experiment collected in Dec 2006.\n\nSample names consist of: treatment:block: replicate where\n        B =     biodegradable oil\n        C =     control\n        L =     lubricant\n        S =     SAB diesel\n        U =     Used lubricant\n\nBlocks 3, 11, 18 and 20 were sampled in this season.\n3 replicates (A,B,C) were carried out for each sample.\nMost probable number was calculated using the MPN Calculator available from: http:/members.ync.net/mcuriale/mpn/index.html\n\nTotal heterotrophs were estimated for control and SAB treatments only.\nUsing Difco marine medium 2216 in 96-well titre trays.\n1:10 serial dilutions were performed in a total of 200 microlitres of medium (as indicated, some samples were done with 1:5 serial dilutions).\nPlates were incubated at 4 degrees C for 7 days.\nPlates were scored manually with visually turbid wells being positive. \n\nNumbers of SAB-degrading bacteria were estimated for all treatments.\nSAB-degrading bacteria were estimated using an artificial seawater broth (see reference below) and 5 microlitres of SAB as carbon source.\n1:5 serial dilutions were made in a total of 200ul of medium.\nPlates were incubated at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks. At this time 40 microlitres of INT solution were added and incubated for another two days (INT = 2.25 g/l of iodonitrotetrazolium chloride).\nPlates were scored manually, with the presence of a red precipitate or red colour being positive. \n\nNumbers of alkane-degrading bacteria were estimated for control and SAB treatments only. \nn-alkane-degrading bacteria were estimated using an artificial seawater broth (see reference below) and 3 microlitres of a 1:1 mix of hexadecane and nonane as carbon source.\n1:5 serial dilutions were made in a total of 200 microlitres of medium.\nPlates were incubated at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks. At this time 40 microlitres of INT solution were added and incubated for another two days (INT = 2.25 g/l of iodonitrotetrazolium chloride).\nPlates were scored manually, with the presence of a red precipitate or red colour being positive.",
