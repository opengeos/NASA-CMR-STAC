    "description": "This data set was created to archive the calculated stream flow gains and\nlosses of tributary streams to the Republican River in Dundy and Chase\nCounties, Nebraska, in July 1975, and make the data available for use with\ngeographic information systems (GIS).\n\nThis arc and point data set contains stream flow-measurement sites and reaches\nindicating stream flow gain or loss under base-flow conditions along Republican\nRiver tributaries in Dundy and Chase Counties, Nebraska during July 14 to 18,\n1975 (U.S. Geological Survey, 1976). The stream flow measurements were made to\nobtain data on ground-water/surface-water interaction. Flow was observed\nvisually to be zero, was measured, or was estimated at 55 sites. Tributaries\nwere followed upstream until the first road crossing where zero flow was\nencountered. For selected streams, points of zero flow upstream of the first\nzero flow site also were checked.\n\nStream flow gain or loss for each stream reach was calculated by subtracting\nthe stream flow values measured at the upstream end of the reach and values for\ncontributing tributaries from the downstream value. The data obtained reflected\nbase-flow conditions suitable for estimating stream flow gains and losses for\nstream reaches between sites.\n\nThis digital data set was created by manually splitting the lines from a\n1:250,000 hydrography data set (Soenksen and others, 1999) at every stream\nflow-measurement site. Each set of stream segments between measurement sites\nwas assigned a unique reach number. \n\n  This digital data set was created by manually plotting locations of stream\nflow measurements. These points were used to designate steam-reach segments to\ncalculate gain/loss per river mile.\n\n  Reach segments were created by manually splitting the lines from a 1:250,000\nhydrography data set (Soenksen and others, 1999) at every location where the\nstreams were measured. Each stream-reach segment between stream flow\nmeasurement sites was assigned a unique reach number. All other lines in the\nhydrography data set without reach numbers were omitted.",
