    "description": "ADEOS-II/AMSR L3 Ice Concentration (1month,0.25deg) dataset is obtained from the AMSR sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) was launched on December 14, 2002 (Japanese Standard Time). The objective of ADEOS-II was to acquire data to contribute to international global climate change research, as well as for applications such as meteorology and fishery. ADEOS-II operation on orbit was given up on October 31 2003, because sufficient electric power was not available to maintain operation of the satellite.AMSR observes various physical contents concerning to water (H2O) by receiving weak microwaves naturally radiated from the Earth's surface and atmosphere and also regardless of day or night, the presence of clouds. Those sensors aim at collecting global data for mainly understanding the circulation of water and energy.Level 3 data inputs level 1B and level 2 data and projected to the map in accordance with the specified projection technique (Equi-Rectangular (EQR) or Polar Stereographic (PS)), and then averaged temporally and spatially. These statistical values are computed for observation data on ascending orbit and descending orbit respectively. This product includes monthly mean Ice Concentration (IC). Ice concentrations are derived mainly from 37 GHz and 19 GHz channels, as in the Bootstrap technique, but makes use of emissivity instead of brightness temperatures to minimizes errors associated with spatial changes in sea ice temperatures. The ice temperature is in the end normalized using the derived ice concentration value, for it to represent temperature only of the sea ice part of the satellite observational area. The physical quantity unit is %.The provided format is HDF4. The current version of the product is \"Version 7\". The statistical period is 1 month.The projection method is PS. The generation unit is global.",
