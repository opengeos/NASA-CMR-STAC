    "description": "This data was collected at Mizuho Station (44.315\u00b0E, 70.71\u00b0S, 2230 m a.s.l.), East Antarctica, from **30 September to 22 November 2000** during the 41st Japanese Antarctic research expedition. Vertical profiles of the horizontal mass flux and particle number size distribution of drifting and blowing snow were measured in the lowest 10 m of the atmosphere using four **snow particle counters** (SPCs). Three 3-dimensional **ultrasonic anemometers** were deployed in the lowest 25 m of the atmosphere to record the wind velocity components and sonic temperature at a high frequency of 100 Hz. Additionally, an **automatic weather station** provided air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, shortwave and longwave downward and upward radiation fluxes, surface temperature, snow temperatures at depths of 0.1 and 0.4 m below the surface, wind speed, and wind direction. The data is complemented by **weather observations** performed twice to eleven times per day by the Japanese Meteorological Agency.  Most of the time, the lowest SPC was situated at a height of 0.05 or 0.1 m above the snow surface. During certain periods called profile runs, the height of the lowest SPC was systematically varied between 0.02 and 0.2 m to increase the vertical resolution of the measured profiles. The other SPC's were installed at fixed heights of 1.1, 3.1, and 9.6 m. During each profile run, the lowest SPC was kept at a specific height for approximately 10 min before changing the height. If the wind speed remained approximately constant throughout a profile run, the data was used to compute the average snow-transport profile in that period. In total, 24 of such average profiles were obtained. A part of these SPC measurements are discussed in Nishimura and Nemoto (2005).  The ultrasonic anemometers were placed at heights of 0.3, 1, and 25 m. However, the height of the lowest ultrasonic anemometer was changed several times in the measurement period and ranged from 0.05 to 0.32 m. On top of that, 19 short periods (each lasting 15 to 160 min) were used to systematically vary the height of the lowest ultrasonic anemometer and thus increase the vertical resolution of the measured wind speed profile. Occasionally, drifting and blowing snow particles perturbed the ultrasonic measurement signal and electrically-charged particles caused an electric charge of the anemometers, leading to artifacts such as spikes and dropouts in the measured time series. These artifacts were largely removed and replaced by NaN, using the statistical spike removal algorithm of Mauder et al. (2013). However,  the artifact removal was sometimes incomplete for the lowest anemometer because of very intense snow transport close to the surface. While temporal averages are barely affected by the artifacts, the high-frequency data of the lowest anemometer should be used carefully when computing turbulent fluxes using the eddy-covariance method. Further important explanations are provided in the file Readme.pdf in data resource '(a) Metadata'.
