    "description": "GPM/DPR/KaPR L1B Received Power dataset is obtained from the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) sensor onboard Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Satellite and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GPM Core Satellite carries DPR and a GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). Main purposes of the GPM are \"Comprehension of horizontal and vertical structure of precipitation systems\", \"Acquisition of precipitation particles information\" and \"Improvement of accuracy of precipitation by constellation satellites\". GPM Core Satellite can observe the range from the south latitude about 65 degrees to the north latitude about 65 degrees, and flies Non-Sun-synchronous Circular Orbit at about the 407 km altitude. To keep the altitude, the Core Satellite does the orbit maintenance maneuver. The interval is about 7-10 days. The swaths of DPR instrument are 125 and 245 km (78 and 152 mile) (245 km since May 21, 2018) for a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) respectively.In addition, simultaneous measurements are done at the overlapping of Ka/Ku-bands of the DPR. The GMI instrument is a conical-scanning multi-channel microwave radiometer covering a swath of 904 km (565 miles). In DPR level 1B standard processing, a level 1A product is read as input data and a product containing a received power profile and geometric information, such as observation positions, is outputted. During the course of processing, radiometric correction is carried out, missing data is processed based on missing data information, scan time is corrected and geometric calculation of the time, latitude, longitude, and height of each piece of scan data in each range bin is performed.The provided format is HDF5. The Sampling resolution are 5km(horizontal) and 125/250m(vertical). The current version of the product is Version 7. The Version 5 is also available. The generation unit is one orbit.",
