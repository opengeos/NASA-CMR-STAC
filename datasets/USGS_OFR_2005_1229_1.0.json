    "description": "In July 2004, at the request of Pam Gardner, District Ranger for the Pleasant\nGrove District of the Uinta National Forest, Ed Harp of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey (USGS) conducted a preliminary assessment of the rock-fall hazard at\nLittle Mill campground in American Fork Canyon, Utah. The campground has had a\nhistory of rock-fall activity and lies immediately east of a former U.S. Forest\nService (USFS) picnic site (Hanging Rock picnic area) where two people were\nkilled by separate rock-fall incidents in the mid-1990s. Harp?s preliminary\nassessment of rock-fall hazard at the campground indicated that parts of the\ncampground were located immediately downslope from active talus chutes and that\nrock from some previous falls had traveled through the campground and across\nthe adjacent American Fork River. Harp concluded his preliminary assessment\nwith the recommendation that a detailed assessment of rock-fall hazard at the\ncampground be conducted using a combination of field- and aerial-based methods.\nThe USFS funded the USGS to conduct this detailed hazard assessment in October\nand November, 2004. This report describes the methodology, results, and\nconclusions from the detailed hazard assessment.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
