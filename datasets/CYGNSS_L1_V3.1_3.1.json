    "description": "This Level 1 (L1) dataset contains the Version 3.1 geo-located Delay Doppler Maps (DDMs) calibrated into Power Received (Watts) and Bistatic Radar Cross Section (BRCS) expressed in units of m2 from the Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument aboard the CYGNSS satellite constellation. This version supersedes Version 3.0; https://doi.org/10.5067/CYGNS-L1X30. Other useful scientific and engineering measurement parameters include the DDM of Normalized Bistatic Radar Cross Section (NBRCS), the Delay Doppler Map Average (DDMA) of the NBRCS near the specular reflection point, and the Leading Edge Slope (LES) of the integrated delay waveform. The L1 dataset contains a number of other engineering and science measurement parameters, including sets of quality flags/indicators, error estimates, and bias estimates as well as a variety of orbital, spacecraft/sensor health, timekeeping, and geolocation parameters. At most, 8 netCDF data files (each file corresponding to a unique spacecraft in the CYGNSS constellation) are provided each day; under nominal conditions, there are typically 6-8 spacecraft retrieving data each day, but this can be maximized to 8 spacecraft under special circumstances in which higher than normal retrieval frequency is needed (i.e., during tropical storms and or hurricanes). Latency is approximately 6 days (or better) from the last recorded measurement time. Here is a summary of improvements the calibration and processing changes to the Version 3.1 data: The CYGNSS science antenna gain patterns have been adjusted to improve the accuracy of the ocean surface scattering cross section (a.k.a. the NBRCS) calibration. They are adjusted so that the annual average observed NBRCS matches the model-predicted average as derived from Wavewatch-3 estimates of the surface roughness with the appropriate spectral tail extension added to the roughness spectrum. The adjustment is made independently at each position in the science antenna pattern. A correction for coarse quantization effects by the on-board digital processor has also been added. This reduces the effects of radio frequency interference, which appeared as calibration biases in the v3.0 L1 NBRCS and retrieval biases in the v3.0 L2 wind speed that were persistent at certain locations.",
