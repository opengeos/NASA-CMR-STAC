    "description": "A ground-water reconnaissance study of the Bijou Creek watershed in South Lake\nTahoe, California was done during the summer and early fall of 2003. This study\nprovides basic hydrologic data for a region in the Lake Tahoe Basin in which a\ncontinuing loss of lake clarity is occurring in the nearshore zone of Lake\nTahoe. Wells, springs, and a surface-water site were located and basic\nhydrologic data were collected. Water levels were measured and water samples\nwere collected and analyzed for nutrients. Measurements of water temperature,\nspecific conductance, and pH were made at all ground-water sites where possible\nand at one surface-water site.\n\nOrganic nitrogen plus ammonia, ammonia, and biologically-available iron\nconcentrations generally were greater in the ground water in the Bijou Creek\nwatershed than those observed in ground water elsewhere in the Lake Tahoe\nBasin. Nitrate concentrations were similar in the two groups. Phosphorus and\northophosphate concentrations generally were lower in the ground water of the\nBijou Creek watershed compared to ground water from elsewhere in the Lake Tahoe\nBasin. Specific conductance and pH of ground water were similar between the\nBijou Creek watershed and the Lake Tahoe Basin, but the temperature of ground\nwater was generally greater in the Bijou Creek watershed.\n\nNitrate concentrations appeared to increase over time at one of two long-term\nground-water sites. Orthophosphate concentration decreased while specific\nconductance increased at one of the two sites, but no trend was detected at the\nother site for either parameter. No trends were detected for phosphorus,\nbiologically-available iron, water temperature, or pH at either of the\nlong-term sites. Trends in ammonia and organic nitrogen plus ammonia\nconcentrations were not evaluated because a majority of the values were below\nthe method detection limits.\n\nThere were no obvious spatial distribution patterns for nutrient concentrations\nor field parameters in the Bijou Creek watershed. The altitude of the\nground-water table above sea level generally increased with increasing distance\nfrom Lake Tahoe. The altitude of the ground-water table was greater than the\naltitude of the surface of Lake Tahoe except at one ground-water site which is\ninfluenced by a cone of depression around a nearby production well. Ground\nwater in the Bijou Creek watershed discharges to Lake Tahoe and may contribute\nto the higher than normal turbidity in the area.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
