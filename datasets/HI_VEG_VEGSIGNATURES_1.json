    "description": "The data consist of 35 'Vegetation Signature' geo-located points and 34 x 35mm terrestrial photos (scanned images) of the vegetation at the actual points, for use in remote sensing research.  The points were collected by Dr Jenny Scott and are located in eastern and southern Heard Island. The dataset is very limited and does not cover all vegetation categories.\n\nAll data points and  images were collected in summer 2003-04 and all images were taken with 50mm (standard view) lens.  There are 34 images and matching data points from four locations; Paddick Valley (south coast); and three locations at Skua Beach on the northeast coast (Scarlet Hill, 'Ranunculus Bluffs' and 'Sooty Valley'). There is one additional data point without a matching image (total data points 35).\n\nThere are 34 scanned photos and a point location shapefile. Each photo is labelled individually.\n\nMost of the sites were in the centre of a patch of similar vegetation at least 10 x 10m in diameter (some may be smaller, some larger; this was not done rigidly).  The notebook in each image indicates the exact point where the DGPS reading was taken.\n\nNot all vegetation categories were sampled.  It was the intention to do this, but lack of time prevented it - these images represent a partial sample of all vegetation categories.\n\nSee metadata notes (word doc) accompanying the images, for additional information and explanation of image locations and veg categories.",
