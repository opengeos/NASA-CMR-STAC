    "description": "SOLVE1_TraceGas_AircraftInSItu_ER2_Data is the in-situ trace gas data for the ER-2 aircraft collected during the SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE). Data were collected by instruments such as the Harvard Hydroxyl Experiment (HOx), Chlorine Nitrate Experiment (CLONO2), Advanced Whole Air Sampler (AWAS), Airborne Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species (ACATS), Argus Tunable Diode Laser Instrument (ARGUS), NOAA O3 Classic, Aircraft Laser Infrared Absorption Spectrometer (ALIAS), Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), and the High-Altitude Fast Response CO2 Analyzer (Harvard CO2). Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe SOLVE campaign was a NASA multi-program effort of the Upper Atmosphere Research Program (UARP), Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project (AEAP), Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling and Analysis Program (ACMAP) and Earth Observing System (EOS) of NASA\u2019s Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). SOLVE\u2019s primary objective was for calibrating and validating the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III satellite measurements, while examining the processes that controlled ozone levels at a mid- to high-latitude range. The major goal of SAGE III was to quantitatively assess ozone loss at high latitudes. SOLVE was a two-phase experiment, the first phase, SOLVE, occurred during the fall of 1999 through the spring of 2000. The second phase, SOLVE II, occurred during the winter of 2003.\r\n\r\nSOLVE took place in the Arctic high-latitude region during the winter. The polar ozone depletion processes cause by human-produced chlorine and bromine are most active in mid-to-late winter and early spring in the high Arctic. In order to conduct this validation experiment, NASA deployed the NASA ER-2 aircraft and NASA DC-8 aircraft. The ER-2 measured a variety of atmospheric data, including ozone (O3), H2O, CO2, ClONO2, HCl, ClO/BrO, and Cl2O2. The DC-8 aircraft measured ozone, ClO/BrO, and aerosol, among other atmospheric data. SOLVE also utilized balloon platforms, ground-based instruments, and collaborations with the German Aerospace Center\u2019s (DLR) FALCON aircraft equipped with the OLEX Lidar to achieve the mission objectives. Overall, the campaign had 28 flights, with SOLVE featuring 17 total flights among the different aircrafts and SOLVE II featuring 11 flights.",
