    "description": "EarthCARE/CPR/EarthCARE_CPR L1B received power dataset is obtained from the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) sensor onboard Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) Satellite and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).EarthCARE Satellite carries four observation sensors: the Cloud Profiling Radar(CPR), the Atmospheric Lidar(ATLID), the Multi-Spectral Imager(MSI), and the Broadband Radiometer(BBR). The main purpose of EarthCARE to globally observe the distribution and vertical structure of clouds and aerosols, as well as the radiant energy at the top of the atmosphere. This project aims to contribute to improving the accuracy of climate change prediction by considering the behavior of clouds and aerosols and their impact on the Earth's climate, incorporating the obtained knowledge into numerical climate models, and constraining the large uncertainties in cloud-aerosol-radiation interactions within numerical climate models. EarthCARE Satellite was launched on 28/05/2024(UTC).EarthCARE Satellite can observe a range from approximately 90 degrees south latitude to approximately 90 degrees north latitude, and flies in a sun-synchronous subrecurrent orbit (number of return days: 25 days) at an altitude of approximately 400 km. The vertial resolution of CPR is approximately 500m.In CPR level 1B standard processing, a level 1 product is read as input data, and the product outputs data containing a received echo power, radar reflectivity factor, NRCS (normalized surface scattering cross section), doppler velocity, spectrum width, and data flag and geometric information, such as observation positions. During the course of processing, radiometric correction is carried out, missing data is processed based on missing data information, scan time is corrected and geometric calculation of the time, latitude, longitude, and height of each piece of scan data in each range bin is performed.The file format is HDF5, but it's compatible with NetCDF4. It is divided into header and science data sections. The sampling resolution is 500 m (horizontal) and 500 m (vertical). The generation unit is 1/8 orbit(1 frame).",
