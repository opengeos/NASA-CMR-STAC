    "description": "The sheet flow over the Buttonwood Embankment during periods of high flow is an unknown element of the water budget for the Everglades. An ongoing project to estimate the flows over the embankment through modeling will require water-level and water velocity data measured at the embankment to accurately estimate simulated flows over this physical land feature. The actual measurement of water velocities and depths at the embankment would greatly improve the model calibration. Although it is virtually impossible to conventionally measure flow over the entire embankment, water depths and velocities at known points along the embankment, combined with the detailed topography of the embankment being developed in another ongoing project, should allow a much better estimate of the total flow than presently available.\n      \n      The objective of the project is to make the best possible estimate of the flow velocities and water depths across Buttonwood Embankment during high flow for use as model input for an ongoing project being conducted in the USGS-WRD office in Miami. Estimates will be used to provide management alternatives and will create salinity concentrations suitable for ecologic integrity.\n      \n      This project has been integrated into the TIME project.  The project was started by Marvin Franklin.",
