    "description": "Information about the Modern Average Global Sea-Surface Temperature (USGS data\nseries DDS-10) Data Set archived at the USGS Global Change Research Program is\navailable via FTP:\n\n\"ftp://geochange.er.usgs.gov in /pub/magsst\"\n\nor via World Wide Web:\n\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds10/magsst.html\"\n\nDirections on how to obtain the CD-ROM or access it on-line are made available\non the WWW site.  The following information about the data set was provided by\nthe data center contact:\n\n  The purpose of this data set is to provide Paleoclimate researchers with a\ntool for estimating the average seasonal variation in sea- surface temperature\n(SST) through out the modern world ocean and for estimating the modern monthly\nand weekly sea-surface temperature at any given oceanic location.  It is\nexpected that these data will be compared with temperature estimates derived\nfrom geological proxy measures such as faunal census analyses and stable\nisotopic analyses. The results can then be used to constrain general\ncirculation models of climate change.\n\n  The data contained in this data set are derived from the NOAA Advanced Very\nHigh Resolution Radiometer Multichannel Sea Surface Temperature data (AVHRR\nMCSST), which are obtainable from the Distributed Active Archive Center at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif.  The JPL tapes contain\nweekly images of SST from October 1981 through December 1990 in nine regions of\nthe world ocean: North Atlantic, Eastern North Atlantic, South Atlantic,\nAgulhas, Indian, Southeast Pacific, Southwest Pacific, Northeast Pacific, and\nNorthwest Pacific.\n\n  This data set represents the results of calculations carried out on the NOAA\ndata and also contains the source code of the programs that made the\ncalculations.  The objective was to derive the average sea- surface temperature\nof each month and week throughout the whole 10-year series, meaning, for\nexample, that data from January of each year would be averaged together.  The\nresult is 12 monthly and 52 weekly images for each of the oceanic regions.\nAveraging the images in this way tends to reduce the number of grid cells that\nlack valid data and to suppress interannual variability.\n\n  As ancillary data, the ETOPO5 global gridded elevation and bathymetry data\n(Edwards, 1989) were interpolated to the resolution of the SST data; the\ninterpolated topographic data are included.  The images are provided in three\nformats: a modified form of run-length encoding (MRLE), Graphics Interchange\nFormat (GIF), and Macintosh PICT format.\n\n  Also included in the data set are programs that can retrieve seasonal\ntemperature profiles at user-specified locations and that can decompress the\ndata files.  These nongraphical SST retrieval programs are provided in versions\nfor UNIX, MS-DOS, and Macintosh computers.  Graphical browse utilities are\nincluded for users of UNIX with the X Window System, 80386-based PC's, and\nMacintosh computers.\n",
