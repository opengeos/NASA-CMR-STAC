    "description": "INTRODUCTION\n      Desertification/Land Degradation - The Background\n      \n      More than 6.1 billion hectares, over one third of the Earth's land\n      area, is dryland.  Nearly one billion hectares of this area are\n      naturally hvperarid deserts, with very low biological\n      productivity. The remaining 5.1 billion hectares are made up of arid,\n      semiarid and dry subhumid areas, part of which have become desert\n      since the dawn of civilization while other parts of these areas are\n      still being degraded by human action today.  These lands are the\n      habitat and the source of livelihood for one quarter of the world's\n      population.  They are areas characterized by the persistent natural\n      menace of recurrent drought, a natural hazard accentuated by\n      imbalanced management of natural resources.  Particularly acute\n      drought years in the Sahelian region of Africa from 1968 to 1973, and\n      their tragic effects on the peoples of the region, drew worldwide\n      attention to the problems of human survival and development in\n      drylands, particularly on desert margins.  These problems have been\n      addressed by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, in conformity\n      with the Charter of the United Nations.  The UN General Assembly's\n      Resolution 3202 (vi) of 1 May 1974 recommended that the international\n      community undertake concrete and speedy measures to arrest\n      desertification and assist the economic development of affected\n      areas. The Economic and Social Council's Resolution 1878 (LVII) of 16\n      July 1974 requested all the concerned organizations of the UN system\n      to pursue a broad attack on the drought problem. Decisions of the\n      Governing Councils of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the UN\n      Environment Programme (UNEP) emphasized the need for undertaking\n      measures to check the spread of desert conditions.  The General\n      Assembly then decided, by Resolution 3337 (xxix) of 17 December 1974,\n      to initiate concerted international action to combat desertification\n      and, in order to provide an impetus to this action, to convene a UN\n      Conference on Desertification (UNCOD), between 29 August and 9\n      September 1977 in Nairobi, Kenya, which would produce an effective,\n      comprehensive and coordinated programme for solving the problem.  For\n      the purposes of this atlas, desertification/land degradation is\n      defined as: Land degradation in arid, semiarid and dry subhumid areas\n      resulting mainly from adverse human impact.",
