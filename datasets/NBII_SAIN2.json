    "description": "This data set contains information on a set of transects and plots that were\noriginally installed in 1987 and 1988 on the grassy balds of the Roan Mountain\nMassif (Round Bald, Engine Gap, Jane Bald, Grassy Ridge, Big Yellow Mountain\n(also known as Yellow Mountain), Little Hump Mountain, Bradley Gap, and Hump\nMountain (also known as Big Hump Mountain). Data collected from the transects\nand plots were to characterize baseline conditions against which the effects of\nfuture vegetation management actions could be evaluated. \n\nThis legacy dataset contains information on the baseline (pre-management)\nconditions of the grassy balds based on the field collections and analysis of\nthe data collected at transects and plots installed in 1987 and 1988. More\nspecifically, this legacy dataset contains information on the first vegetation\ncomposition analysis and first comprehensive plant inventory conducted on the\nRoan Mountain grassy bald complex. \n\nInformation that describes this dataset primarily comes from the following\nsources: various field reports, memos, letters, grant proposals, hardcopies of\nthe 1987 and 1988 data sheets, photos of the original transects and plots, and\ninterviews with the originators of the transect and plot data.\n\nThis metadata record documents legacy data to the extent practical, as required\nby Executive Order 12906, \"Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and Access:\nThe National Spatial Data Infrastructure\", dated April 11, 1994. Details may be\nmissing, but given the resources available, the information provided herein is\nas concise as possible at this point in time.",
