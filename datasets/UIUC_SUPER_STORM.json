    "description": "The March 12-15, 1993 superstorm will be remembered as one of the\n            strongest storms to ever strike the Eastern United States. Overall,\n            270 fatalities were reported with an estimate property damage over $3\n            billion. Record sea level pressure, low temperatures, and wind gusts\n            were reported by many observation stations. The entire East Coast of\n            the United States from Florida to Maine was affected by this storm.\n            \n            The University of Illinois Weather World 2010 project offers an\n            extensive case study of this major weather event. This study begins\n            with an introduction and is followed by archived surface products and\n            satellite imagery. The surface products (surface analysis) begin at\n            1200 UTC on March 12, 1993 and end 0900 UTC March 15, 1993. The\n            satellite imagery (visible, infrared, water vapor) begins at 0000 UTC\n            March 12, 1993 and ends 2300 UTC March 15, 1993.\n            \n            This case study is available via World Wide Web from The Weather World\n            2010 Home Page.\n            Link to: http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/arch/cases/930312/home.rxml",
