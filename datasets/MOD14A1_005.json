    "description": "The MOD14A1.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \n\nMODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products are primarily derived from MODIS 4- and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are employed to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline.\n\nMOD14A1 is produced every 8 days at 1-kilometer resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. This product is unique in that it has three dimensions: fire-mask (1D) and a maximum fire-radiative-power (2D) are provided for each day (3D) in the 8-day period. For example, the fire-mask contains eight, band sequential (day) 1200 x 1200 images of fire data representing consecutive days of data collection.\n\nThe Terra MODIS instrument acquires data twice daily (10:30 AM and PM), as does the Aqua MODIS (2:30 PM and AM). These four daily MODIS fire observations serve to advance global monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate.\n\nVersion-5 MODIS Thermal Anomalies & Fire products have attained Validation Stage 3, which was completed using active fire reference data that were derived from ASTER and Landsat-5 TM (30 m resolution) data sources.\n\nChange Points of Interest\n\n\u2022 Internal HDF compression reduces products to ~5% of their uncompressed size.\n\n\u2022 Added two new SDSs (\u201cMaxFRP\u201d and \u201csample\u201d).\n\n\u2022 SDS \"most confident detected fire\" renamed as \"FireMask\".\n\n\u2022 Reduced 32-bit QA to simpler 8-bit layer.\n\n\u2022 Added global HDF attributes to simplify use of tile-level QA.\n\n\u2022 As always, MOD14A1 products contain 8 days of data per file, but in V005, metadata are written for each day, rather than as totals for the entire 8-day period.\n\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \nTemporal Coverage: February 26, 2000 - March 29, 2017\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \nFile Size: ~0.5MB \nProjection: Sinusoidal \nData Format: HDF-EOS \nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns\nResolution: ~1000 meters\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 4 + Vdata Table\nFire Mask Data Type: 8-bit unsigned integer",
