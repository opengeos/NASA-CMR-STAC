    "description": "This dataset represents Weddell Seal haulout and pupping sites in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica.\nThe data were sourced from a dataset compiled by Samantha Lake and described by the metadata record 'Distribution of Weddell seals pupping at the Vestfold Hills'. She used a reporting grid described by the metadata record 'Weddell seal reporting grid of the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica' to show observations made over 24 years (pupping areas) and 28 years (non-breeding areas). The map Samantha produced of pupping areas is linked to the metadata record 'Distribution of Weddell seals pupping at the Vestfold Hills'.\n\nPolygons were generated by copying relevant grid rectangles from a digital version of the reporting grid, referring to the maps produced by Samantha; the grid rectangles used were those in which there had been greater than 20 observations (pupping), 17 observations (non-breeding).\nThe data was used in an A3 map of the Vestfold Hills published by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre in October 2001 and which is available from a Related URL below.\n\nThe data are included in the data available for download from a Related URL below.\nThe data conform to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See a Related URL below. \nData described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 155. \nEach feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets & quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature.",
