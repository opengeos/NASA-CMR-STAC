    "description": "The primary objectives of our research are to (1) quantify the changes in spatial distribution and success of nesting spoonbills relative to hydrologic patterns, (2) test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for observed changes, (3) establish a science-based criteria for nesting distribution and success to be used as a performance measure for hydrologic restoration, and (4) estimate demographic parameters. To meet these objectives, we will use a combined field/modeling approach. Based on previous and concurrent research, hypothesized relationships between hydrology, fish populations, and spoonbill nesting distribution and success will be expressed in a simple, but spatially explicit, conceptual model. Field data will be collected and compared with predicted responses to monitor changes in spoonbill nesting as hydrologic restoration is implemented, and to test the hypothesized mechanisms for observed changes. Variation of hydrologic conditions among years and locations is a virtual certainty; thus we will treat this variation in a quasi-experimental framework where the variation in wet and dry season conditions constitutes a series of \"natural experiments\".\n\nOur project is designed to evaluate the effect of hydrologic restoration on the nesting distribution and success of Roseate Spoonbills (Ajaia ajaia) in Florida Bay and surrounding mangrove estuarine habitats. This project is further designed to test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms of observed changes. The Everglades ecosystem has suffered extensive degradation over the past century, including an 85-90% decrease in the numbers of wading birds. Previous monitoring of Roseate Spoonbills in Florida Bay over the past 50 years has shown that this species responds markedly to changes in hydrology and corresponding changes in prey abundance and availability. Shifts in nesting distribution and declines in nest success have been attributed to declines in prey populations as a direct result of water management. Consequently, the re-establishment of spoonbill colonies in northeast Florida Bay is one change predicted under a conceptual model of the mangrove estuarine transition zone of Florida Bay. Changes in nesting distribution and success will further be used as a performance measure for success of restoration efforts and will be incorporated in a model linking mangrove fish populations and spoonbills to alternative hydrologic scenarios.",
