    "description": "This repository consists of the merged data from WaMos2 (2010) and WaMos2 (2020) and also includes both Corona-related surveys that have been conducted within the phase of WaMos3.     WaMos3 is the third assessment of the relationship of the Swiss population to the forest after 1997 and 2010 and was conducted in 2020. As in WaMos2 in 2010, the attitude of the population to the forest as a recreation area, to wood production and to the protective and ecological functions were examined. The topic of climate change was also included. In addition, the views of adolescents between 15 and 18 years of age were taken into account for the first time.     A detailed description of the provided data  can be found in accompanied file \"WaMos_Metadatenbeschreibung_221027.pdf\" which also contains explanations and examples of the merging process from WaMos2 to WaMos3 as well as sampling procedures. Further, the samples itself can be processed with the help of the provided R-file \"EnviDat_WaMos_dataset.R\".",
