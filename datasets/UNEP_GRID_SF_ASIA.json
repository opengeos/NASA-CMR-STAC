    "description": "The Asian administrative boundaries and population database is part of\n      an ongoing effort to improve global, spatially referenced demographic\n      data holdings. Such databases are useful for a variety of applications\n      including strategic-level agricultural research and applications in\n      the analysis of the human dimensions of global change.\n      \n      This project (which has been carried out as a cooperative activity\n      between NCGIA, CGIAR and UNEP/GRID between Oct. 1995 and present) has\n      pooled available data sets, many of which had been assembled for the\n      global demography project. All data were checked, international\n      boundaries and coastlines were replaced with a standard template, the\n      attribute database was redesigned, and new, more reliable population\n      estimates for subnational units were produced for all countries. From\n      the resulting data sets, raster surfaces representing population\n      distribution and population density were created in collaboration\n      between NCGIA and GRID-Geneva.",
