    "description": "These maps (maps A and B) were prepared in support of a regional\nthree-dimensional ground-water model currently being constructed by the U.S.\nGeological Survey (USGS) for the DVRFS.  The maps identify regional geologic\nstructures whose possible hydrologic significance merits their inclusion in the\nHFM for the DVRFS.\n\nThe locations of principal faults and structural zones that may influence\nground-water flow were compiled in support of a three-dimensional ground-water\nmodel for the Death Valley regional flow system (DVRFS), which covers 80,000\nsquare km in southwestern Nevada and southeastern California.  Faults include\nNeogene extensional and strike-slip faults and pre-Tertiary thrust faults.\nEmphasis was given to characteristics of faults and deformed zones that may\nhave a high potential for influencing hydraulic conductivity. These include: \n(1) faulting that results in the juxtaposition of stratigraphic units with\ncontrasting hydrologic properties, which may cause ground-water discharge and\nother perturbations in the flow system; (2) special physical characteristics of\nthe fault zones, such as brecciation and fracturing, that may cause specific\nparts of the zone to act either as conduits or as barriers to fluid flow; (3)\nthe presence of a variety of lithologies whose physical and deformational\ncharacteristics may serve to impede or enhance flow in fault zones; (4)\norientation of a fault with respect to the present-day stress field,  possibly\ninfluencing hydraulic conductivity along the fault zone; and (5) faults that\nhave been active in late Pleistocene or Holocene time and areas of contemporary\nseismicity, which may be associated with enhanced permeabilities.\n\nThe faults shown on maps A (Structural Framework, Neogene Basins, and\nPotentiometric Surface) and B (Structural Framework, Earthquake Epicenters, and\nPotential Zones of Enhanced Hydraulic Conductivity) are largely from Workman\nand others (in press), and fit one or more of the following criteria:  (1)\nfaults that are more than 10 km in map length; (2) faults with more than 500 m\nof displacement; and (3) faults in sets that define a significant structural\nfabric that characterizes a particular domain of the DVRFS. The following fault\ntypes are shown:  Neogene normal, Neogene strike-slip, Neogene low-angle\nnormal, pre-Tertiary thrust, and structural boundaries of Miocene calderas.  We\nhave highlighted faults that have late Pleistocene to Holocene displacement\n(Piety, 1996). Areas of thick Neogene basin-fill deposits (thicknesses 1-2 km,\n2-3 km, and >3 km) are shown on map A, based on gravity anomalies and\ndepth-to-basement modeling by Blakely and others (1999).  We have interpreted\nthe positions of faults in the subsurface, generally following the\ninterpretations of Blakely and others (1999).  Where geophysical constraints\nare not present, the faults beneath late Tertiary and Quaternary cover have\nbeen extended based on geologic reasoning. Nearly all of these concealed faults\nare shown with continuous solid lines on maps A and B, in order to provide\ncontinuous structures for incorporation into the hydrogeologic framework model\n(HFM).  Map A also shows the potentiometric surface, regional springs (25-35\ndegrees Celsius, D'Agnese and others, 1997), and cold springs (Turner and\nothers, 1996).\n\nA composite base map is included based upon published 83-m DEM data from USGS\n1:250,000-scale quadrangles, as well as road lines and political boundaries\nfrom published USGS 1:100,000-scale DLG data. The 1:100,000-scale data were\ngeneralized to 1:250,000 scale for inclusion with the 1:250,000-scale database.\n\nAdditional coverages include a ground-water model area coverage, and text\nlabels for structural features.  Files necessary for printing the map are also\nincluded such as text fonts, linesets, shadesets, projection files, and AML\nfiles.  These files are all explained in the included README.txt file.",
