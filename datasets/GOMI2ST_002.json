    "description": "GOMI2ST_002 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level 2 TOA/Cloud Stereo Product subset for the GoMACCS region version 2. It contains the Stereoscopically Derived Cloud Mask (SDCM), cloud winds, and Reflecting Level Reference Altitude (RLRA) with associated data. MISR itself is an instrument designed to view Earth with cameras pointed in 9 different directions. As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all nine cameras in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the fate of sunlight in Earth environment, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure.\n\nMISR is designed to view Earth with cameras in 9 different directions.
