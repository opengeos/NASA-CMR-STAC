    "description": "To update and reinterpret earlier geologic mapping, and to provide sufficient\ngeologic information for land-use decisions.\n\nNew 1:24,000-scale geologic mapping in the Silt 7.5' quadrangle, in support of\nthe USGS Western Colorado I-70 Corridor Cooperative Geologic Mapping Project,\nprovides new interpretations of the stratigraphy, structure, and geologic\nhazards in the area of the southwest flank of the White River uplift, the Grand\nHogback, and the eastern Piceance Basin.\n\nThe Wasatch Formation was subdivided into three formal members, the Shire,\nMolina, and Atwell Gulch Members.  Also a sandstone unit within the Shire\nMember was broken out.  The Mesaverde Group consists of the upper Williams Fork\nFormation and the lower Iles Formation.  Members for the Iles Formation consist\nof the Rollins Sandstone, the Cozzette Sandstone, and the Corcoran Sandstone\nMembers.  The Cozzette and Corcoran Sandstone Members were mapped as a combined\nunit.  Only the upper part of the Upper Member of the Mancos Shale is exposed\nin the quadrangle.\n\nFrom the southwestern corner of the map area toward the northwest, the\nunfaulted early Eocene to Paleocene Wasatch Formation and underlying Mesaverde\nGroup gradually increase in dip to form the Grand Hogback monocline that\nreaches 45-75 degree dips to the southwest (section A-A').  The shallow west-\nnorthwest-trending Rifle syncline separates the northern part of the quadrangle\nfrom the southern part along the Colorado River.\n\nGeologic hazards in the map area include erosion, expansive soils, and\nflooding.   Erosion includes mass wasting, gullying, and piping.  Mass wasting\ninvolves any rock or surficial material that moves downslope under the\ninfluence of gravity, such as landslides, debris flows, or rock falls, and is\ngenerally more prevalent on steeper slopes.  Locally, where the Grand Hogback\nis dipping greater than 60 degrees and the Wasatch Formation has been eroded,\nleaving sandstone slabs of the Mesa Verde Group unsupported over vertical\ndistances as great as 500 m, the upper part of the unit has collapsed in\nlandslides, probably by a process of beam-buckle failure.  In the source area\nof these landslides strata are overturned and dip shallowly to the northeast. \nLandslide deposits now armor Pleistocene pediment surfaces and extend at least\n1 km into Cactus Valley.  Gullying and piping generally occur on more gentle\nslopes.  Expansive soils and expansive bedrock are those unconsolidated\nmaterials or rocks that swell when wet and shrink when dry.  Most floods are\nrestricted to low-lying areas.\n\nSeveral gas-producing wells extract methane from coals from the upper part of\nthe Iles Formation.\n\nMap political location: Garfield County, Colorado\nCompilation scale: 1:24,000\nGeology mapped in 1992 to 1996.\nCompilation completed March 1997.",
