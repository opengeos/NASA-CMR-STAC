    "description": "GAP distribution models represent the areas where species are predicted to occur based on habitat associations. GAP distribution models are the spatial arrangement of environments suitable for occupation by a species. In other words, a species distribution is created using a deductive model to predict areas suitable for occupation within a species range.\n\nTo represent these suitable environments, GAP compiled existing GAP data, where available, and compiled additional data where needed. Existing data sources were the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) and the Southeast Gap Analysis Project (SEGAP) as well as a data compiled by Sanborn Solutions and Mason, Bruce and Girard. Habitat associations were based on land cover data of ecological systems and--when applicable for the given taxon--on ancillary variables such as elevation, hydrologic characteristics, human avoidance characteristics, forest edge, ecotone widths, etc.\n\nDistribution models were generated using a python script that selects model variables based on literature cited information stored in a wildlife habitat relationship database (WHRdb); literature used includes primary and gray publications. Distribution models are 30 meter raster data and delimited by GAP species ranges. Distribution model data were attributed with information regarding seasonal use based on GAP regional projects (NWGAP, SWReGAP, SEGAP, AKGAP, HIGAP, PRGAP, and USVIGAP), NatureServe data, and IUCN data.\n\nA full report documenting the parameters used in each species model can be found via: http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/species/Map.aspx\n\nWeb map services for species distribution models can be accessed from:\nhttp://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Birds\nhttp://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Mammals\nhttp://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Amphibians\nhttp://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Reptiles\n\nA table listing all of GAP's available web map services can be found here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species/data/web-map-services/\n\nGAP used the best information available to create these species distribution models; however GAP seeks to improve and update these data as new information becomes available.\n\nRecommended citation: U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program (USGS-GAP).
