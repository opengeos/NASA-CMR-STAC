    "description": "This database and accompanying plot files depict the distribution of geologic\nmaterials and structures at a regional (1:24,000) scale.  The report is\nintended to provide geologic information for the regional study of materials\nproperties, earthquake shaking, landslide potential, mineral hazards, seismic\nvelocity, and earthquake faults. In addition, the report contains new\ninformation and interpretations about the regional geologic history and\nframework.  However, the regional scale of this report does not provide\nsufficient detail for site development purposes.  In addition, this map does\nnot take the place of fault-rupture hazard zones designated by the Oregon State\nGeologist.  Similarly, the database cannot be used to identify or delineate\nlandslides in the region.\n\nThis digital map database, compiled from previously published and unpublished\ndata, and new mapping by the authors, represents the general distribution of\nbedrock and surficial deposits of the Salem East and Turner 7.5 minute\nquadrangles.  A previously published adjacent geologic map and database by\nTolan, Beeson, and Wheeler (1999) contains a text file (geol.txt or geol.ps),\nit provides current information on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of\nthe area covered. The database delineates map units that are identified by\ngeneral age and lithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S.\nGeological Survey. The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution\n(scale) of the database to 1:24,000 or smaller.\n\nThe Salem East and Turner 7.5-minute quadrangles are situated in the center of\nthe Willamette Valley near the western margin of the Columbia River Basalt\nGroup (CRBG) distribution. The terrain within the area is of low to moderate\nrelief, ranging from about 150 to almost 1,100-ft elevation. Mill Creek flows\nnorthward from the Stayton basin (Turner quadrangle) to the northern Willamette\nValley (Salem East quadrangle) through a low that dissects the Columbia River\nbasalt that forms the Salem Hills on the west and the Waldo Hills to the east.\nApproximately eight flows of CRBG form a thickness of up to 700 in these two\nquadrangles. The Ginkgo intracanyon flow that extends from east to west through\nthe south half of the Turner quadrangle is exposed in the hills along the\nsoutheast part of the quadrangle.\n\nThe major emphasis of this study was to identify and map CRBG units within the\nSalem East and Turner Quadrangles and to utilize this detailed CRBG\nstratigraphy to identify and characterize structural features. Water well logs\nwere used to provide better subsurface stratigraphic control. Three other\nquadrangles (Scotts Mills, Silverton, and Stayton NE) in the Willamette Valley\nhave been mapped in this way (Tolan and Beeson, 1999).\n\nThe databases in this report were compiled in ARC/INFO, a commercial Geographic\nInformation System (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands,\nCalifornia), with version 3.0 of the menu interface ALACARTE (Fitzgibbon and\nWentworth, 1991, Fitzgibbon, 1991, Wentworth and Fitzgibbon, 1991).  The files\nare in either GRID (ARC/ INFO raster data) format or COVERAGE (ARC/INFO vector\ndata) format. Coverages are stored in uncompressed ARC export format (ARC/INFO\nversion 7.x).  ARC/INFO export files (files with the .e00 extension) can be\nconverted into ARC/INFO coverages in ARC/INFO (see below) and can be read by\nsome other Geographic Information Systems, such as MapInfo via ArcLink and\nESRI's ArcView (version 1.0 for Windows 3.1 to 3.11 is available for free from\nESRI's web site: \"http://www.esri.com\"). The digital compilation was done in\nversion 7.1.1 of ARC/INFO with version 3.0 of the menu interface ALACARTE\n(Fitzgibbon and Wentworth, 1991, Fitzgibbon, 1991, Wentworth and Fitzgibbon,\n1991).  The geologic map information was digitized from stable originals of the\ngeologic maps at 1:24,000 scale.  The author manuscripts (pen on mylar and pen\non paper) were scanned using a Anatek rasterizing color scanner with a\nresolution of 600 and 400 dots per inch.  The scanned images were vectorized\nand transformed from scanner coordinates to projection coordinates with digital\ntics placed by hand at quadrangle corners.  The scanned lines were edited\ninteractively by hand using ALACARTE, color boundaries were tagged as\nappropriate, and scanning artifacts visible at 1:24,000 were removed.",
