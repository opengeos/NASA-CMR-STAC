    "description": "ERBE_S4G_MFOV_SF_ZG_1 is the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) Non-scanner S-4G Medium-field of View (MFOV) Shape Factor (SF) Zonal and Global Averages data product. Data collection for this product is complete. This data set consists of non-scanner, medium field-of-view data, which was processed using the shape factor data reduction technique. The data are averaged over latitudinal bands(zones) as well as on a global level in which each parameter is averaged over the entire globe. The zonal averages are available in 10.0 degree resolution. Monthly (day), monthly (hour), daily, and monthly hourly averages are determined for each region. The data are represented as 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integers.\r\n\r\nEarth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) was a multi-satellite system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget. ERBE instruments flew on a mid-inclination National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, NOAA-9 and NOAA-10. NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 provided global coverage and the ERBS provided coverage between 67.5 degrees north and south latitude. Each satellite carried both a scanner and a non-scanner instrument package. The non-scanner instrument contained four Earth-viewing channels and a solar monitor. The Earth-viewing channels had two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth, and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter. The former was called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium field of view (MFOV) channels. For each of the two fields of view, there was a total spectral channel which is sensitive to all wavelengths and a shortwave channel which used a high purity, fused silica filter dome to transmit only the shortwave radiation from 0.2 to 5 microns. Because of the concern for spectral flatness and high accuracy, all five channels on the non-scanner package were active cavity radiometers. The ERBE S-4G product contained averages of radiant flux and albedo on regional, zonal, and global scales. The data for the S-4G product were arranged by parameter values. The ERBE S-4G WFOV product was available as a combination of all operational spacecraft. Products have been archived from November 1984 - January 1985 and June 1989 - February 1990 for ERBS; February 1985 - October 1986 for ERBS/NOAA-9; November 1986 - January 1987 for ERBS/NOAA-9/NOAA-10; and February 1987 - May 1989 for ERBS/NOAA-10. The various combinations of the satellites reflected the actual duration of the scanners.",
