    "description": "The dataset contains a list of the location of sixteen soil samples taken from the vicinity of the Casey EPH fuel tank on the 13/02/2012 and 20/03/2012. Soil samples were taken for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) analysis and will be submitted to Analytical Services Tasmania for said analysis.  The investigation is related to a leak detected from the threaded unions on the Casey EPH fuel tank supply line (refer to IHIS incident report 2684).  Samples 100114 - 100120 were taken at selected locations within the recognisable spill area and down-gradient of the site on the 13/02/2012 by Dan Wilkins (Scientific Officer, Terrestrial and Nearshore Ecosystems, Science Branch.) Samples 99319-99332 were taken from a 5 m grid sampling pattern on the 20/03/2012 by Johan Mets (Plant Operator), acting under the direction of Dan Wilkins. Frozen conditions prevented samples being obtained from recommended depths (i.e. under the road base). \n\nFields in the dataset:\nSTD: Sample Tracking Database number (unique identifier)\nEasting: Easting (UTM 49S)\nNorthing: Northing (UTM 49S)\nSample Depth: Depth of sample beneath soil surface (where recorded)\nComment: Comment on location of sample and any observation about hydrocarbon \nSample Date: Date of sample collection in dd/mm/yyyy format\nSampler: Name of sample collector",
