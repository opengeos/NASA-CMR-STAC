    "description": "The Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) and other data were collected in Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea. Data was collected from Ship ALPHA HELIX cruise Aleutian Birds HX-172 funded by National Science Foundation Division of Polar Programs . The data was collected over a period spanning from July 9, 1993 and August 7, 1993. Data was submitted in a cassette by Dr. Chirk Chu of Institute of Marine Science, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK. Data has been processed and is available in F022-CTD-Hi Resolution file format of NODC.\n\nF022 High-resolution CTD data is collected from high resolution (conductivity-temperature-depth) instruments. As they are lowered and raised in the oceans, these electronic devices provide nearly continuous profiles of temperature, salinity and other parameters. Data values may be subject to averaging or filtering or obtained by interpolation and may be reported at depth intervals as fine as 1 m. Cruise and instrument information, position, date, time and sampling interval are reported for each station. Environmental data at the time of the cast (meteorological and sea surface conditions) may also be reported. The data record comprises values of temperature, salinity or conductivity, density (computed sigma-t) and possibly dissolved oxygen or transmissivity at specified depth or pressure levels. Data may be reported at either equally or unequally spaced depth or pressure intervals.",
