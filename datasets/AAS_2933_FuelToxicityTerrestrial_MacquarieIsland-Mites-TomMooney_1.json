(2018, updated 2019) Response of Macquarie Island springtails to diesel fuel contaminated soils under field-realistic exposure conditions Australian Antarctic Data Centre - doi:10.26179/5c1b0686dabc9. \n\nThe present record adds mite taxa to the dataset.\n\nAs per AAS_2933_FuelToxicityTerrestrial_MacquarieIsland-Springtails-TomMooney:\nThis data record describes work conducted by Thomas Mooney on Macquarie Island during the 2008/09 and 2009/10 field seasons.\n\nThe experimental design of this work included sampling three sites located in uncontaminated areas, within the vicinity of the Macquarie Island research station. One transect (length: 50 m) was located per site; each transect spanned a soil carbon gradient, from sandy to peaty soil types. Each 50 m transect included 10 plots (plot size 1 m2). Seven pairs of soil cores were collected from each plot. Soil core dimensions were 70 mm diameter x 70 mm deep. Soil core pairs were spiked with Special Antarctic Blend (SAB) diesel; one unspiked control and six spiked concentrations per plot. After spiking, cores were incubated under field-realistic conditions for 15 days. After incubation, one core per pair was used for invertebrate extraction, the other was used for soil physicochemical analysis. Percentage cover of plant species and bare ground were surveyed for each plot.\n\nThe data provided with this record include details of soil core fuel spike, mite species counts, soil physicochemical properties and vegetation cover within plots. \n\nThis work formed part of TMs PhD research (Mooney 2013). PhD supervisors were Dr Catherine King (AAD) and Associate Professor Nigel Andrew (UNE). Funding was provided by AAS projects 2933 and 4100 (King) and 4036 (Snape) and an Australian Postgraduate Award to TM (University of New England, Australia).\t\n\nReference: Mooney T.
