    "description": "Admiralty Bay is one of the best studied sites in the maritime Antarctic. The\nfirst benthos data has been recorded in 1906 and knowledge is constantly gained\nby the research activities of permanent stations, Arctowski  (Poland, since\n1977), and Ferraz  (Brazil, since 1984).\n\nAdmiralty Bay is a protected area within the Antarctic Treaty System, an\n\u0093Antarctic Specially Managed Area\u0094 (ASMA). It was also a reference site under\nthe EASIZ programme, and has been or is currently investigated by several\nnations : Poland, Brazil, United States, Peru, Ecuador, Germany, The\nNetherlands, Belgium.\n\nABBED (Admiralty Bay Benthos Biodiversity Database) is a Belgian-Polish\ninitiative, which aims at compiling and linking existing information on\nAdmiralty Bay benthos biodiversity and ecology. This information will be\ndigitized into a database and linked to wider Antarctic marine biodiversity\ninitiatives, such as SCAR-MarBIN, which will disseminate the information\nthrough a web portal.\n\nBeing highly diverse in its content, formats and data providers, ABBED will\nconstitute an extremely interesting case-study for SCAR-MarBIN, allowing to\ntest strategic options which were retained for the development of the network.\nMoreover, the quality and quantity of data which will be made available to the\ncommunity will reinforce the status of Admiralty Bay as a true reference point\nfor Antarctic biodiversity research.\n\nThe project aims at developing an interactive database on the biodiversity of\nbenthic communities of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, for scientific,\nmonitoring, management and conservation purposes. It is intended to be a\nspringboard for promoting future research in this region, by centralizing the\nrelevant information for i.e. scientific programme design.",
