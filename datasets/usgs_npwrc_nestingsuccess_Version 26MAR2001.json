    "description": "We followed 3094 upland nests of several species of ducks. Clutches in most\nnests were lost to predation. We related daily nest predation rates to indices\nof activity of eight egg-eating predators, precipitation during the nesting\nseason, and measures of wetland conditions. Activity indices of red fox (Vulpes\nvulpes), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and raccoon (Procyon lotor)\nactivity were positively correlated, as were activity indices of coyote (Canis\nlatrans), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii), and\nblack-billed magpie (Pica pica).  Indices of fox and coyote activity were\nstrongly negatively correlated (r = early-season nests were lower in areas and\nyears in which larger fractions of seasonal wetlands contained water.  For\nlate-season nests, a similar relationship held involving semipermanent\nwetlands. We suspect that the wetland measures, which reflect precipitation\nduring some previous period, also indicate vegetation growth and the abundance\nof buffer prey, factors that may influence nest predation rates.",
