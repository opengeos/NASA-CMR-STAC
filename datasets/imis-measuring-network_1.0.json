    "description": "The Intercantonal Measurement and Information System (IMIS) consists of nearly 200 automatic measuring stations. They are distributed throughout the Swiss Alps and the Jura region and, in most cases, are situated above the tree line, most frequently between 2000 and 3000 m. The stations record the conditions around the clock, in general every 30 minutes.   Most IMIS stations are located in the vicinity of starting zones of potentially destructive avalanches, and provide essential information to local safety officers for public safety in settlements and on the roads. They are also used for snow-hydrological and research purposes and by the avalanche warning service of the SLF.  This dataset comprises data from IMIS snow and wind stations. The snow and wind stations are usually situated close to each other and measure the key weather data required for assessing the avalanche danger.      ## IMIS snow stations    Snow stations are located on wind-protected flat terrain. The snowpack model SNOWPACK calculates the layers and properties of the snowpack throughout the winter for each of the IMIS snow stations.  The following variables are measured or simulated in the standard programme of IMIS snow stations and are available in this dataset:    - Snow depth  - 24-hour new snow (SNOWPACK simulation) - Air and surface temperature  - Wind speed and direction - Relative humidity - Reflected shortwave radiation - Ground temperature - Snow temperature 25 cm, 50 cm and 100 cm above the ground    ## IMIS wind stations    Wind stations are generally situated at higher altitudes on exposed summits or ridges. The following variables are measured in the standard programme of IMIS wind stations and are available in this dataset:    - Wind speed and direction - Air temperature - Relative humidity        __When using the data, please consider and adhere to the associated [Terms of Use](https://www.slf.ch/en/services-and-products/slf-data-service/)__.    __To download live data use our [API](https://measurement-api.slf.ch)__.    __To download data older than 7 days use our [File Download](https://measurement-data.slf.ch)__.",
