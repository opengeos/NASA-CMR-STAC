    "description": "[Summary Adapted from the ASHOE/MAESA Home Page]\n      \nThis CD-ROM contains data pertaining to the combined experiment: Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment; and Measurements for Assessing the Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft (ASHOE/MAESA).  This  experiment was conducted in four phases between March and November  1994 at NASA Ames Research Center, California; Barbers Point, Hawaii;  and Christchurch, New Zealand.\n      \nThe data consist of in situ and remotely sensed measurements collected onboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft; radiosonde, ozonesonde, and backscatter sonde balloon measurements; ground-based spectrometer and lidar measurements; and SAGE II satellite measurements. Theory teams provided calculations of: meteorological parameters in the form of partial hemispheric analyses, cross-sections along the ER-2 flight track, interpolations to the ER-2 flight path, and back- trajectories of selected parcels along the ER-2 flight path; photodissociation rates of selected chemical species along the ER-2 flight path; and cloud properties along the ER-2 flight track.\n      \nThis data along with several other aircraft field experiments are also maintained in an on-line archive.
