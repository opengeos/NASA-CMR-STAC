    "description": "The purpose of this project is to map the surficial geology of the sea\nfloor of Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS) and changes in\nsurficial characteristics over time.  The sea floor of the HARS,\napproximately 9 square nautical miles in area, is being remediated by\nplacing at least a one-meter of clean dredged material on top of the\nexisting surface sediments that exhibit varying degrees degradation\nresulting from previous disposal of dredged and other material.  This\nGIS project presents multibeam and other data in a digital format for\nanalysis and display by scientists, policy makers, managers and the\ngeneral public.  Comparison of the topography and backscatter\nintensity from the three surveys show changes in topography and\nsurficial sediment properties resulting from placement of dredged\nmaterial in 1996 and 1997 prior to designation of the HARS, as well as\nplacement of material for remediation of the HARS.  This study is\ncarried out cooperatively by the U.S. Geological Survey and the\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThis data set includes topography and backscatter intensity of the sea\nfloor of the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS), located offshore\nof New York and New Jersey.  The data were collected with a multibeam\nsea floor mapping system on surveys conducted November 23 - December\n3, 1996, October 26 - November 11, 1998, and April 6 - 30, 2000.  The\nsurveys were conducted using a Simrad EM 1000 multibeam echo sounder\nmounted aboard the Canadian Hydrographic Service vessel Frederick\nG. Creed.  This multibeam system utilizes 60 electronically aimed\nreceive beams spaced at intervals of 2.5 degrees that insonify a strip\nof sea floor up to 7.5 times the water depth (swath width of 100 to\n200 m within the survey area).  The horizontal resolution of the beam\non the sea floor is approximately 10% of the water depth (3-5 meters\nin the survey region).  Vertical resolution is approximately 1 percent\nof the water depth, or 0.3 m.  Maps derived from the mulitbeam\nobservations show sea floor topography, shaded relief, and backscatter\nintensity (a measure of sea floor texture and roughness) at a spatial\nresolution of 3 m/pixel.",
