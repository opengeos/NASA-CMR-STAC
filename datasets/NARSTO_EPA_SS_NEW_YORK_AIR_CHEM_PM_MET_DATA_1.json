    "description": "NARSTO_EPA_SS_NEW_YORK_AIR_CHEM_PM_MET_DATA is the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Supersite (SS) New York Air Chemistry, Particulate Matter, and Meteorological Data. It was collected between 2001 and 2006 during the PM2.5 Technology Assessment and Characterization Study in New York State (PMTACS-NY). Data files from all components of the PMTACS-NY Supersite program are archived in this single data set. The PMTACS-NY Supersite program provided a unique and unparalleled opportunity to enhance our understanding of ozone/PM2.5-precursor relationships and track progress in current precursor emission control programs and assess their effectiveness in achieving expected air quality responses. The impact of this research is highly significant, providing a sound scientific basis for informed effective decisions in the management of air quality in New York and significant benefit to its citizens - both environmentally and economically. The U.S. EPA Particulate Matter (PM) Supersites Program was an ambient air monitoring research program designed to provide information of value to the atmospheric sciences, and human health and exposure research communities. Eight geographically diverse projects were chosen to specifically address these EPA research priorities: (1) to characterize PM, its constituents, precursors, co-pollutants, atmospheric transport, and its source categories that affect the PM in any region; (2) to address the research questions and scientific uncertainties about PM source-receptor and exposure-health effects relationships; and (3) to compare and evaluate different methods of characterizing PM including testing new and emerging measurement methods.\r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
