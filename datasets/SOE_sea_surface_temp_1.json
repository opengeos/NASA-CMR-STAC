Measurements are averaged over latitude bands: 40-50 deg S, 50-60 deg S, 60 deg S-continent.\n\nTYPE OF INDICATOR\nThere are three types of indicators used in this report:\n1.Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system;\n2.Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system;\n3.Determine RESPONSES to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.\n\nThis indicator is one of: CONDITION\n\nRATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION\nAustralian and Antarctic climate and marine living resources are sensitive to the distribution of ocean temperature.  Sea surface values are relatively easy to monitor, and therefore can be used as a relevant indicator of the state of the ocean environment.\n\nThe information provided by long records of sea surface temperature is needed to detect changes in the Southern Ocean resulting from climate change; to test climate model predictions; to develop an understanding of links between the Ocean and climate variability in Australia; and for sustainable development of marine resources.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial scale: Southern Ocean: 40 deg S to the Antarctic continent\n\nFrequency: Monthly averages over summer\n\nMeasurement technique: Measurements of sea surface temperature from Antarctic supply ships. The best spatial coverage of sea surface temperature is provided by satellites, due to extensive cloud cover in the Southern Ocean and biases in the satellite measurement, in situ observations of sea surface temperature are necessary.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nSea surface temperature has not been previously used as a spatially averaged environmental indicator.  Some experimentation with past data are required to define the most appropriate averaging strategy.\n\nNew technologies like profiling Argo floats need to be exploited to provide better spatial and temporal coverage of temperature in the Southern Ocean.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nSea ice extent and concentration\nChlorophyll concentrations\nSea surface salinity",
