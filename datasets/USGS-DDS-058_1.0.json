    "description": "The safe disposal of high-level radioactive wastes is one of the most pressing\nenvironmental issues of modern times.  At present, most of these materials are\nbeing stored under temporary conditions at many of the individual nuclear power\nplants where  they were produced.  In recognition of the need for permanent\nwaste storage, Yucca  Mountain in southwestern Nevada has been investigated by\nFederal agencies since the  1970's as one of the Nation's potential geologic\ndisposal sites.  In 1987, Congress  selected Yucca Mountain for an expanded and\nmore detailed site characterization effort,  and a broad multidisciplinary\nprogram of studies was developed by the U.S. Department  of Energy to further\nevaluate the suitability of the mountain as a safe and permanent  underground\ndisposal facility.  The scope and objectives of the many kinds of \ninvestigations to be pursued were guided in large measure by regulations\ngoverning  the siting of geologic repositories for high-level radioactive\nwastes that were issued  by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Code of\nFederal Regulations 10CFR60) and  supplmented by further requirements set forth\nby the U.S. Department of Energy (Code  of Federal Regulations 10CFR960).\n\nAs an integral part of the planned site-characterization program, the U.S.\nGeological  Survey began a series of detailed geologic, geophysical, and\nrelated investigations  designed to characterize the tectonic setting, fault\nbehavior, and seismicity of the  Yucca Mountain area.  A broad goal was to\nprovide essential data for assessing the  possible risks posed by future\nseismic and fault activity in the area that may affect  the design and\nlong-term performance, and the safe operation, of the potential surface  and\nsubsurface repository facilities.\n\nThe results of 13 of the many studies undertaken to increase understanding of\nthe  tectonic environment of Yucca Mountain and the adjacent area are presented\nin this  report.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
