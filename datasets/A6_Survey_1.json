    "description": "Construction of a suitable runway near Casey was a major objective of the Air Link from Hobart to the Australian Antarctic Territory and the main focus of the 2003/03 season's fieldwork. The 2001/2002 summer season's Air Transport Study identified several 'Blue Ice' runway sites and undertook a detailed investigation at a site named R3 in the upper Peterson Glacier (UPG) region approximately 50 km south east of Casey Station.\n\nThis season a six-member team was assembled to undertake additional investigation work and initial site and runway surface construction capable of supporting wheeled aircraft conducting inter-continental flights from Hobart. The Air Transport Project team members included:\n\nGeorge Blaisdell - Civil Engineer \nAaron Read - Surveyor\nSeane Hall - Mechanic \nSimon Larkman - Communications Technician \nLeigh Maclagan - Plant Operator \nRob Sheers - Mechanical Engineer\n\nThe objective for this season\u2019s survey was to undertake further work on R3 and if it was not suited for constructing a runway surface, then locate and map a site that met the criteria for a blue ice runway. From Landsat 7 satellite imagery it was evident that larger and higher elevated patches of blue ice were visible south of the R3 and within these areas a potential runway site might be located. \n\nA suitable runway site was located about 65 km south east of Casey and this report documents the work undertaken in locating and mapping this site. \n\nAdditional to the runway survey a number of other tasks were also carried out in support of science programs being undertaken at Casey.\n\nThe report covers the survey field work undertaken by Air Transport Project (ATP) during the 2002/2003 ANARE Summer Field Season. Data collected in support of other scientific programs has been included in this report primarily as a record of work undertaken by the mapping program. These data have been supplied to the various scientists for inclusion in their studies.",
