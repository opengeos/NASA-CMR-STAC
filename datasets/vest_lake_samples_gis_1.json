    "description": "This data set contains locations of sample sites for Ellis Fjord (1989), Organic Lake (1985) and Deep Lake (1975, 1975) in the Vestfold Hills. \n  \nUnfortunately little is known as to what samples were collected.  It is believed that water samples were taken at all locations, and that bottom sediment samples were taken at least at Deep Lake.\n\nWhen questioned in 2009, the investigating scientist was unable to remember exactly what work was done.  The original maps may provide some clues.",
