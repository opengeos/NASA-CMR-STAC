    "description": "\nThis dataset contains ground reference crop type labels and multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from multiple satellites in an area located in Western Cape, South Africa. There are five crop types from the year 2017: Wheat, Barely, Canola, Lucerne/Medics, Small grain grazing. The AOI is split to three tiles. Two tiles are provided as training labels, and one tile will be used for scoring in the competition. \n\nInput imagery consist of time series of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and Planet Fusion (daily and 5-day composite) data. You can access each source from a different collection. \n\nThe Planet fusion data are made available under a CC-BY-SA license. As an exception to the AI4EO Terms and Conditions published on the competition website, you confirm, by participating in it, that you agree that your results will be made public under the same, open-source license. \n\nThe Western Cape Department of Agriculture (WCDoA) vector data are supplied via Radiant Earth Foundation with limited distribution rights. Data supplied by the WCDoA may not be distributed further or used for commercial purposes. The vector data supplied are intended strictly for use within the scope of this remote sensing competition - for the purpose of academic research to our mutual benefit. The data is intended for research purposes only and the WCDoA cannot be held responsible for any errors or omissions which may occur in the data.\n",
