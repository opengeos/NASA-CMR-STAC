    "description": "The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) is developing a\nhydrodynamic model of the SGR estuary, which is part of the comprehensive\nwater-quality model of the SGR estuary and watershed investigated by SCCWRP and\nother local agencies. The hydrodynamic model will help understanding of 1) the\nexchange processes between the estuary and coastal ocean; 2) the circulation\npatterns in the estuary; 3) upstream natural runoff and the cooling discharge\nfrom PGS.\n\nLike all models, the SGR hydrodynamic model is only useful after it is fully\ncalibrated and validated. In May 2005, SCCWRP requested the assistance of the\nU.S. geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology team (CMG) in\ncollecting data on the hydrodynamic conditions in the estuary during the summer\ndry season. The summer was chosen for field data collection as this was assumed\nto be the season with the greatest potential for chronic degraded water quality\ndue to low river flow and high thermal stratification within the estuary (due\nto both higher average air temperature and PGS output). Water quality can be\ndegraded in winter as well, when higher river discharge events bring large\nvolumes of water from the Los Angeles basin into the estuary. The objectives of\nthis project were to 1) collect hydrodynamic data along the SGR estuary; 2)\nstudy exchange processes within the estuary through analysis of the\nhydrodynamic data; and 3) provide field data for model calibration and\nvalidation. As the data only exist for the summer season, the results herein\nonly apply to summer conditions.",
