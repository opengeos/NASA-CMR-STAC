    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L2 Sea surface temperature is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km. This product includes bulk sea surface temperature, which applied the cloud detection and the atmospheric correction. The former is the process to find clear, or no cloud-contaminated, pixels in the image. The combination of the threshold tests is used to detect clouds. The latter is needed to obtain SST of clear pixels from the brightness temperatures observed by GLI. The Multi-Channel SST (MCSST) technique is used. This product is generated from Level-2A_OA product. The physical quantity is Kelvin.  This product also includes Quality flag or mask, Satellite Zenith Angle, Satellite Azimuth Angle, Solar Zenith Angle, Solar Azimuth Angle, Tilt Angle Flag as supplement data. The provided format is HDF. Map projection is not done. Generation unit is path. The spatial resolution is approximately 4 km. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
