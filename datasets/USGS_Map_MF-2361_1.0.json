    "description": "This map was funded by the National Cooperative Geologic Program as part of the\ngeologic mapping studies conducted along the I-70 urban corridor.  This\ncorridor is experiencing rapid urban growth and geologic mapping is needed to\naid in land-use planning in order to address, avoid, and mitigate known and\npotential geologic hazards.\n\nThe Eagle quadrangle covers an area that straddles the Eagle River and\nInterstate 70 (I-70) and it includes the town of Eagle, Colo., which is located\nin the southwestern part of the quadrangle, just south of I-70 and the Eagle\nRiver, about 37 km west of Vail, Colo.  The map area is part of the I-70 urban\ncorridor, which is experiencing rapid and escalating urban growth.  Geologic\nmapping along this corridor is needed for ongoing land-use planning.  A variety\nof rocks and deposits characterize the map area and areas nearby.  Sedimentary\nrocks present in the map area range in age from Pennsylvanian rocks, which were\ndeposited in the ancestral Eagle basin during the formation of the ancestral\nRocky Mountains, to Late Cretaceous rocks that were deposited just prior to the\nformation of the present Rocky Mountains. The Pennsylvanian rocks in the map\narea include a thick sequence of evaporitic rocks (Eagle Valley Evaporite). \nThese evaporitic rocks are commonly complexly folded throughout the southern\npart of the quadrangle where they are exposed.  In general, in the central and\nnorthern parts of the quadrangle, the sedimentary rocks overlying the evaporite\ndip gently to moderately northward.  Consequently, the youngest sedimentary\nrocks (Late Cretaceous rocks) are exposed dipping gently to the north in the\nnorthern part of the quadrangle; landslide complexes are widespread along the\nnortherly dipping, dip slopes in shaly rocks of the Cretaceous sequence in the\nnortheastern part of the map area.  During the Early Miocene, basaltic\nvolcanism formed extensive basaltic flows that mantled the previously deformed\nand eroded sedimentary rocks.  Erosional remnants of the basaltic flows are\npreserved in the southeastern, west-central, and north-central parts of the map\narea.  Some of these basaltic flows are faulted and downdropped in a manner\nthat suggests they were downdropped in areas where large volumes of the\nunderlying evaporitic rocks were removed from the subsurface, beneath the\nbasaltic rocks, by dissolution or flowage of the evaporite in the subsurface. \nQuaternary and late Tertiary(?) surficial deposits in the map area consist\nmainly of Quaternary alluvium and colluvium, late and middle Pleistocene\nterrace gravels of the Eagle River, Miocene(?) gravel remnants of the ancestral\nEagle River and its tributaries, and Pleistocene to recent mass movement\ndeposits that include landslides and debris flows. Potential geologic hazards\nin the map area include landslides, debris flows, rockfalls, local flooding,\nground subsidence, and expansive and corrosive soils.\n\nMap political location: Eagle County, Colorado\nCompilation scale: 1:24,000\nGeology mapped in 1997.\n\nGEOSPATIAL DATA FILES INCLUDED IN THIS DATA SET:\n        eaglepy: polygon coverage containing geologic unit contacts and labels.\n        eagleln: arc coverage containing fold axes and other line entities.\n        eaglept: point coverage containing bedding attitude measurements\n        and other point entities.\n        eaglepit: polygon coverage containing gravel pits.",
