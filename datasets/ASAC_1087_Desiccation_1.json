    "description": "This series of experiments were conducted in the Casey station laboratories, using field collected moss samples, during the 1999/2000 summer field season. The work is fully described in Wasley et al. 2006 and Chapter 5 of Wasley 2004 (pp. 118-152), full citation details are:\n- Wasley J., Robinson S.A., Lovelock C.E., Popp M. (2006) Some like it wet \u2014 biological characteristics underpinning tolerance of extreme water stress events in Antarctic bryophytes, Functional Plant Biology 33. 443-455. \n- Wasley J. (2004) The Effect of Climate Change on Antarctic Terrestrial Flora, Doctor of Philosophy, University of Wollongong 191pp. \nIn summary, three byrophyte species were investigated: Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Ceratodon purpureus and Grimmia antarctici (later taxonomically revised as Schistidium antarctici). \nSamples of the three moss species were collected early, mid and late season (2/12/99, 24/1/00 and 27/2/00) from ASPA 135 on Bailey Peninsula.  Additional samples of G. antarctici were also collected from the edge of the melt lake behind the Casey station accommodation building. \nSelected samples were used to determine a range of biological traits for the three species, including: \n- morphology (gametophyte density and width) \n- physiological response to desiccation and subsequent recovery\n- a range of plant biochemical characteristics (soluble carbohydrates, fatty acids, nitrogen and carbon contents and N and C stable isotope signatures)\nThese traits were used to assess the biological characteristics underpinning relative tolerance of desiccation in the three Antarctic bryophytes species.  This work improves our understanding of how these three species survive extreme water stress events in the Antarctic environment.\n\nThe raw data associated with this work, in the form of laboratory notebook scans are available in Metadata record name: JWasley-LabBook-Casey-1999-2000 (http://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/JWasley-LabBook-Casey-1999-2000). Following is a description of these scanned data \u2013 which are arranged in three sections: 1. early-season, 2. mid-season and 3. late-season experiments. \n1.\tThe early-season experiment, using samples of moss collected from the field on 2 December 1999, is recorded on pages 5-22 of the laboratory notebook and uses filename \"desiccation 991203\".
