    "description": "The northwest-striking southern Whidbey Island fault zone (SWIF) was mapped\npreviously using borehole data and potential-field anomalies on Whidbey Island\nand marine seismic surveys beneath surrounding waterways. Abrupt subsidence at\na coastal marsh on south-central Whidbey Island suggests that the SWIF\nexperienced a MW 6.5 to 7.0 earthquake about 3000 years ago. Southeast of\nWhidbey Island, a hypothesized southeastward projection of the SWIF would make\nlandfall between the cities of Seattle and Everett. As part of systematic,\nongoing studies by the U.S. Geological Survey, University of Washington, and\nother earth science organizations to evaluate potentially active faults and\nother earth hazards throughout the Puget Lowland, we test this hypothesis using\naeromagnetic, lidar, and borehole data.\n\nLinear, northwest-striking magnetic anomalies traversing the mainland region\nproject southeastward toward the communities of Woodinville and Maltby,\nWashington. All of these magnetic anomalies are low in amplitude and best\nilluminated in residual magnetic fields. The most prominent of the residual\nmagnetic anomalies extends at least 16 km, lies approximately on strike with\nthe SWIF on Whidbey Island, and passes near Crystal and Cottage Lakes, about 27\nkm southeast of downtown Everett. In places, this magnetic anomaly is\nassociated with topographic lineaments, but spectral analysis indicates that\nthe source of the anomaly extends to depths greater than 2 km and cannot be\nexplained entirely by topographic effects. The Alderwood #1 oil exploration\nwell located on strike with the Cottage Lake aeromagnetic lineament shows\nevidence of deformation over a total depth range of 3000 m; some beds within\nthis interval exhibit intense fracturing and shearing, although deformation\nwithin the well can only be constrained as post-early Oligocene and\npre-Pleistocene. Boreholes acquired as part of a wastewater tunnel project show\nevidence of soil disturbance at locations where some topographic and\naeromagnetic lineaments cross the tunnel alignment. Some of the disturbance is\nlikely tectonic in origin, although other explanations are possible. Some of\nthe soil disturbance demonstrably predates the 15-13 ka Fraser glaciation of\nthe Puget Lowland; other samples have inconclusive ages and may be younger.\nSubtle scarps in Pleistocene surfaces are visible on high-resolution lidar\ntopography at a number of locations along the Cottage Lake aeromagnetic\nlineament. Collectively, the scarps are parallel to the trend of the\naeromagnetic lineament and extend a total distance of 18 km. In the field,\nscarps exhibit 1 to 5 m of north-side-up offset. The scarps provide targets for\nfuture paleoseismic trenching studies to test the hypothesis that they have a\ntectonic origin. \n\n[Summary provided by USGS.]",
