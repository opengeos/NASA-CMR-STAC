    "description": "Records of methane, and oxygen isotopes (ice and air) for Law Dome DSS (Dome Summit South) core through the last deglaciation (9000-19000 before present).\n\nData are obtained from the entire DSS core, collected between late 1987 and early 1993.\n\nData comprise air composition measurements (d18Oair (per mille) and methane composition (ppbv)) and water isotope data (per mille) from the Law Dome core with age scale matched to the GRIP (Greenland) ice core. Default age scale (yr BP, 1950) gives best age scale - LDmin age scale gives a minimum age limiting case that is not the preferred dating.\n\nSupporting information is provided in a pdf document available both in the dataset for download, and the online Science site.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 757.\n\nThe work is also related to the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP), and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2).\n\nThe last deglaciation was marked by large, hemispheric, millennial-scale climate variations: the Bolling-Allerod and Younger Dryas periods in the north, and the Antarctic Cold Reversal in the south. A chronology from the high-accumulation Law Dome East Antarctic ice core constrains the relative timing of these two events and provides strong evidence that the cooling at the start of the Antarctic Cold Reversal did not follow the abrupt warming during the northern Bolling transition around 14,500 years ago. This result suggests that southern changes are not a direct response to abrupt changes in North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, as is assumed in the conventional picture of a hemispheric temperature seesaw.\n\nPublic Summary from project 757:\nPrediction of future climate change requires knowledge of past changes. Polar snow forms an archive of environmental conditions that is accessible by drilling and analysing ice cores. This project uses ice core data to reconstruct and study records, including past temperature and atmospheric composition, to improve understanding of the climate system.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\n(Note: Ages are all BP (1950); the two scenarios only give identical gas-ages at tie-points.)\n\nSample Mid Depth (metres)\nSample Length (metres)\nDelta 18O air (ppt)\nSample Mid Gas Age (Default)\nDelta Age (Default) (years)\nSample Mid Gas Age (LDmin)\nDelta Age (LDmin) (years)\nCH4 (ppbv)\nDepth (metres)\nAge (Default)\nAge (LDmin)\nDelta 18 O (ppt)",
