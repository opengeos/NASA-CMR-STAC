    "description": "Aerial photographs taken by NOAA's National Geodetic Survey during 1992 were mosaicked and orthorectified by the Biogeography Branch. The resulting image was used to digitize benthic, land cover and mangrove habitat maps of the Salt River Bay National Historic Park and Ecological Preserve (National Park Service), on St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.The mosaic is centered on the National Park Service Site, located on the north central coast of St. Croix, and in some areas extends beyond the park boundaries up to 2 km.",
