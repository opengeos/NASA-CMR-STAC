    "description": "The diversity of the microbial communities in each treatment in the SRE4 in situ biodegradation experiment were examined using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the 16S rRNA gene. The SRE4 experiment was a field experiment that looked at the effect of synthetic lubricant, used synthetic lubricant, a biodegradable lubricant and special Antarctic blend (SAB) diesel on the marine benthic environment.  Samples were collected at 5 weeks, 54 weeks, 65 weeks, 2 years and 5 years after deployment of the experimentally contaminated sediment.\n\nThe samples used in this experiment were collected from O'Brien Bay, near Casey Station in the Windmill Islands. \n\nAn information sheet is provided at the beginning of the excel workbook giving method information in detail.\n\nThe dataset consists of list of t-RFs (fragment lengths) for each sample and also the statistical analysis for significant differences between treatment groups. This work was completed as part of ASAC project 2672 (ASAC_2672).",
