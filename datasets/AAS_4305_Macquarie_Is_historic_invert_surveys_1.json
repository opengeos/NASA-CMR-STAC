    "description": "A compilation for historical data on Macquarie Island invertebrate data from the following surveys\n- 1986/87 (Penny Greenslade)\n- 2009/10 (Mark Stevens)\n- 1993/94 (Disney)\n- 1991-1993 (Davies and Melbourne)\n\nInvertebrate community assemblages. These were community assessments undertaken at historic sites (i.e. previously trapped in 1980s, 1990s and 2000. Sites were relocated to the best of our ability and resurveyed. New sites were established. Data comprise species presence and abundance per site, potentially with additional site information (e.g. environmental conditions).\n\nListed below are some of the data sources for this data compilation:\n\nGreenslade, P. (1987). Report on invertebrate fieldwork Macquarie Island, December 1986 \u2013 January 1987. Unpublished report. Department of Primary Industry, Parks, Water and the Environment. Tasmania, Australia. \nEstablished 8 invertebrate monitoring sites in four vegetation communities in the northernmost part of the island. Pitfalls and Litter, hand collecting over a ~ 5 week spring/summer period.\n\nDisney (91) - Reported in Stevens et al. 2010.  Resampled four of Greenslade's sites.  Pitfalls large and small over a year. \n\nDavies, K.F. and Melbourne, B.A. (1999). 'Statistical models of invertebrate distribution on Macquarie Island: a tool to assess climate change and local human impacts'. Polar Biology 21: 240\u2013250. Sampled 69 sites across the island in different vegetation communities over a 6 week summer period. Litter, pitfalls, yellow pans and handcollecting. \n\nStevens, M., Hudson, P., Greenslade, P. and Potter, M. (2010). Report on invertebrate monitoring of long term field sites on Macquarie Island 2009/2010. Unpublished report. South Australia: South Australia Museum. Resampled seven of Greenslade's sites, plus a further eight over a 5 week spring/summer. Litter, yellow pans, pitfalls.",
