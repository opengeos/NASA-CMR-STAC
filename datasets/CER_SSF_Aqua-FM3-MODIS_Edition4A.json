    "description": "CER_SSF_Aqua-FM3-MODIS_Edition4A is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA)/Surface Fluxes, Clouds and Aerosols Aqua-Flight Model 3 (FM3) Edition4A data product, which was collected using the CERES-FM3 instrument on the Aqua platform. Data collection for this product is in progress.\r\n\r\nCERES SSF TOA/Surface Fluxes are data for a single scanner instrument. The SSF combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from a higher-resolution imager such as Visible/Infrared Scanner (VIRS) on the Tropical Measuring Mission (TRMM), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi- National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP). Scene identification and cloud properties are defined at the higher imager resolution, and these data are averaged over the larger CERES footprint. For each CERES footprint, the SSF contains the number of cloud layers and, for each layer, the cloud amount, height, temperature, pressure, optical depth, emissivity, ice and liquid water path, and water particle size. The SSF also contains the CERES-filtered radiances for the total, shortwave (SW), and window (WN) channels and the unfiltered SW, longwave (LW), and WN radiances. The SW, LW, and WN radiances at spacecraft altitude are converted to TOA fluxes based on the imager-defined scene. These TOA fluxes are used to estimate surface fluxes. On the SSF, only footprints with adequate imager coverage are included, which is much less than the complete set of footprints on the CERES ES-8 product.\r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions follow the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, the protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
