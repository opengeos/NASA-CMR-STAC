    "description": "During the K-Axis marine voyage from mid Jan-late Feb 2016, a diverse range of sampling techniques were employed to collect specimens and data. Each sampling event was recorded by scientists and technical support staff in a logbook that was kept in the operations room on board the Aurora Australis. This is a PDF of the scanned original document, compiled on paper during the voyage.\n    \nevent_number: A unique event identifier in the log, in the order that the events were written down (usually but not always chronologically)\nevent_type: The code defined and used by each research project to identify the types of equipment deployed or samples collected for an event. \nevent_type_prefix: A non-mandatory prefix field used by some research projects to identify the type of an event\nevent_type_number: A sequential number or alphanumeric-number combination defined and used by each research project to identify unique equipment deployment or sample collection events\nstation_number: A universal (voyage-wide) station number used across all projects to identify a nominal lat/lon position defined during voyage planning\nleg: A nominally straight-line section of the voyage track defined during voyage planning. The voyage track was planned as a series of roughly N-S and E-W transects that intersected in some locations. Legs start at a station and continue through more stations to a vertex-station which is the start of the next leg. Legs are numbered consecutively.\nwaypoint: A GPS waypoint used by Aurora Australis crew, AAD science technical support and researchers to identify target lat/lon positions in the voyage. Some waypoints correspond with station numbers.\nstart_date_utc: The start date of the event in UTC\nstart_time_utc: The start time of the event in UTC\nstart_lat_deg: The latitude (whole degrees) of the vessel at the beginning of the event\nstart_lat_min: The latitude (minutes) of the vessel at the beginning of the event\nstart_lat_dec_deg: The latitude (decimal degrees) of the vessel at the beginning of the event\nstart_lon_deg: The longitude (whole degrees) of the vessel at the beginning of the event\nstart_lon_min: The longitude (minutes) of the vessel at the beginning of the event\nstart_lon_dec_deg:  The longitude (decimal degrees) of the vessel at the beginning of the event\nend_date_utc: The end date of the event in UTC\nend_time_utc: The end time of the event in UTC\nend_lat_deg: The latitude (whole degrees) of the vessel at the end of the event\nend_lat_min: The latitude (minutes) of the vessel at the end of the event\nend_lat_dec_deg: The latitude (decimal degrees) of the vessel at the end of the event\nend_lon_deg: The longitude (whole degrees) of the vessel at the end of the event\nend_lon_min: The longitude (minutes) of the vessel at the end of the event\nend_lon_dec_deg: The longitude (decimal degrees) of the vessel at the end of the event\nremarks: Comments/remarks written by researchers when completing the paper log",
