    "description": "Analysis of aeromagnetic and gravity data provides new insights into the\ngeometry of geologic structures of the upper and middle Verde River watershed,\nYavapai County, Arizona. Magnetic anomalies reveal hidden volcanic rocks lying\nat shallow depths beneath the ground surface in Williamson, Little Chino, Big\nChino and Verde Valleys in the upper Verde River watershed, Yavapai County,\nArizona. Concentrations of shallowly buried volcanic plugs or centers are\nlocated down-gradient of springs (Del Rio) and perennial flow (Williamson\nValley), suggesting that these volcanic centers or plugs may retard\nground-water flow. Magnetic data also map paleo-channels filled with 4-6 Ma\nbasalt as Big Chino Valley formed and subsided during late Tertiary time. The\nmagnetic data reveal a predominantly northeast- to north-striking structural\ngrain within Proterozoic basement rocks, in contrast to the generally northwest\nstrike of late Tertiary faults in this region. The magnetic grain may serve as\na proxy for fracturing and faulting, an important source of permeability in\nthese generally impermeable rocks. Magnetic and gravity data also delineate\nexposed and concealed faults within the study area. The Big Chino fault and\nVerde fault zone have the largest amounts of vertical throw of any fault in the\nstudy area based on gravity, magnetic, and limited well data. These faults\nbound deep (1-2 km) basins in Big Chino and Verde Valleys. The geophysical data\nalso reveal concealed faults in Williamson Valley that bound a previously\nundiscovered basin with approximately 1 km of Cenozoic fill inferred from\ninversion of gravity data. Little Chino and Lonesome Valleys, including the\nupper reach of the Agua Fria basin, are characterized by basin fill which\nnowhere exceeds 1 km and has a more irregular distribution with local, north-\nto northwest-striking pockets of thicker sediment. A 15- to 20-km-long\nnorthwest-striking magnetic lineament that passes through Page Springs in Verde\nValley can be used to project a fault 5-10 km northwest and southeast of its\nmapped trace. The colocation of the lineament, mapped fault, and the spring\nsuggests structural influence on the location of this large spring.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
