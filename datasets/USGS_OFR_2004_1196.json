    "description": "A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was used to map the relative vulnerability\nof the coast to future sea-level rise within Cumberland Island National\nSeashore in Georgia. The CVI ranks the following in terms of their physical\ncontribution to sea-level rise-related coastal change: geomorphology, regional\ncoastal slope, rate of relative sea-level rise, historical shoreline change\nrates, mean tidal range and mean significant wave height. The rankings for each\ninput variable were combined and an index value calculated for 1-minute grid\ncells covering the park. The CVI highlights those regions where the physical\neffects of sea-level rise might be the greatest. This approach combines the\ncoastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to\nchanging environmental conditions, yielding a quantitative, although relative,\nmeasure of the park's natural vulnerability to the effects of sea-level rise.\nThe CVI provides an objective technique for evaluation and long-term planning\nby scientists and park managers. Cumberland Island National Seashore consists\nof stable to washover-dominated portions of barrier beach backed by wetland,\nmarsh, mudflat and tidal creek. The areas within Cumberland that are likely to\nbe most vulnerable to sea-level rise are those with the lowest foredune ridge\nand highest rates of shoreline erosion.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
