    "description": "Metadata record for data from AAS (ASAC) Project 2933.\n\nWhile it is generally thought that Antarctic organisms are highly sensitive to pollution, there is little data to support or disprove this. Such data is essential if realistic environmental guidelines, which take into account unique physical, biological and chemical characteristics of the Antarctic environment, are to be developed. Factors that modify bioavailability, and the effects of common contaminants on a range of Antarctic organisms from micro-algae to macro-invertebrates will be examined. Risk assessment techniques developed will provide the scientific basis for prioritising contaminated site remediation activities in marine environments, and will contribute to the development of guidelines specific to Antarctica.\n\nAmphipod and Isopod toxicity tests, Kingston 2007\n\nFilename: Amphipod and Isopod test results.xls\n\nTest animals were collected from near shore environments at Casey Station, East Antarctica during Dec 2006 - Jan 2007, and transported to culturing facilities at the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania, where tests were conducted during 2007. The test animals were exposed to metals in non-renewable static tests in vials containing 50 mL of the test solution at ambient Antarctic coastal salinity of 34 ppt. Tests were held in temperature controlled cabinets (incubators) at a temperature of 0 degrees C (plus or minus approximately 1 degrees C). Five to eight test animals were introduced into each of 3 replicate vials per treatment at test commencement, and were exposed for 10 to 12 weeks during which periodic observations were made. Test solutions were renewed in weekly water changes.\n\nPeriodic observations (time since start of test) are given in hr (hours), d (days) or w (weeks). At each observation time, test animals were scored in one of the Endpoint categories described on each worksheet. \n\nEach worksheet provides data for a particular test taxa (slater isopods, small red isopods, spider amphipods and Orange Long Antennae Amphipods - taxonomy to be verified) for a given test number (T01, T02) and a given metal contaminant (copper, zinc, cadmium).\n\nTest information is provided in the first 14 rows of each worksheet, e.g. Site of collection, Test start date, Endpoint categories etc. \n\nASU = artificial settlement units (plastic scourers used by Sarah Richards, which had been deployed in Newcomb Bay in approximately the year 2000).\n\nConc micrograms/L are nominal concentrations. Measured concentrations are provided in the worksheet: /Amph and Isop T01-02 CHEMISTRY SUMM\n\nTest temperature was 0 degrees C unless otherwise stated. Unit for all temperature data is degrees C. \n\nThe file contains the following worksheets: \n\nWorksheet: /Amph and Isop T01-02 CHEMISTRY SUMM\nChemistry data as provided also in Kingston 07 Chemistry_Amph and Iso.xls described below. \n\nWorksheet: /Slater isopods T01 Cu\nTest taxa: Slater isopod; Test ID: T01, Kingston 2007; Metal contaminant: copper\n\nWorksheet: /Slater isopods T01 Zn\nTest taxa: Slater isopod; Test ID: T01, Kingston 2007; Metal contaminant: zinc\n\nWorksheet: /Slater isopods T01 Cd\nTest taxa: Slater isopod; Test ID: T01, Kingston 2007; Metal contaminant: cadmium\n\nWorksheet: /Small red isopods T02 Cu\nTest taxa: Small red isopods; Test ID: T02, Kingston 2007; Metal contaminant: copper\n\nWorksheet: /Small red isopods T02 Zn\nTest taxa: Small red isopods; Test ID: T02, Kingston 2007; Metal contaminant: zinc\n\nWorksheet: /Spider Amphipods T01 Cu\nTest taxa: Spider Amphipods; Test ID: T01, Kingston 2007; Metal contaminant: copper\n\nWorksheet: /Orange LongAnt Amph T01 Cu\nTest taxa: Orange Long Antenae Amphipods; Test ID: T01, Kingston 2007; Metal contaminant: copper\n\n\nFilename:Kingston 07 Chemistry_Amph and Iso.xls \n\nMetal concentrations in test solutions were analysed using an ICP-AES, by Ashley Townsend at the Central Science Laboratory, University of Tasmania, Hobart.\nWorksheet: /Amph and Isop T01-02 Summary\nSummary of chemistry data for Amphipod and Isopod tests\n\nWorksheets: /From Ash....\nSeries of raw data worksheets provided by Ashley, each with date stamp (ddmmyy).",
