    "description": "Studies of chemical contamination in Antarctica are commonly focused on POPs. However, some emerging pollutants exhibiting characteristics of persistence comparable to POPs should also be considered. Hale et al. (2006) highlighted the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) in sediment next to McMurdo station. These compounds are used as flame retardant and are present in many modern polymer-containing products, e.g., home/office furnishings and electronics. BDE-209, the major constituent in commercial deca- PBDE products, was the dominant congener in sludge and dust, as well as aquatic sediments collected near the McMurdo wastewater outfall. Pattern and BDE-209 sediment concentration, in conjunction with its limited environmental mobility, suggested inputs from local sources. The total concentration of PBDEs ranged from 43.6 to 1820 ng g-1. The data indicate that reliance on wastewater maceration alone, as stipulated by the Protocol, may permit entry of substantial amounts of PBDEs and other chemicals to the Antarctic environment.",
