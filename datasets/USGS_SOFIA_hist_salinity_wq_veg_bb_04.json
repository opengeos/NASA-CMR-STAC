    "description": "The objectives of this project are to examine in broad context the historical changes in the Biscayne Bay ecosystem at selected sites on a decadal-centennial scale, and to correlate these changes with natural events and anthropogenic alterations in the South Florida region. Specific emphasis will be placed on historical changes to 1) amount, timing, and sources of freshwater influx and the resulting effects on salinity and water quality; 2) shoreline and sub-aquatic vegetation; and 3) the relationship between sea-level change, onshore vegetation, and salinity. In addition, a detailed examination of historical seasonal salinity patterns will be derived from biochemical analyses of molluscs, ostracodes, foraminifera and corals. The corals will allow us to compare marine and estuarine trends, examine the linkage between the two systems, and will provide precise chronological control. Land management agencies (principally SFWMD, ACOE and Biscayne NP) can use the data derived from this project to establish performance criteria for restoring natural flow, and to understand the consequences of altered flow. These data can also be used to forecast potential problems as upstream changes in water delivery are made during restoration.\n      \n      During the last century, Biscayne Bay has been greatly affected by anthropogenic alteration of the environment through urbanization of the Miami/Dade County area, and alteration of natural flow. The sources, timing, delivery, and quality of freshwater flow into the Bay, and the shoreline and sub-aquatic vegetation have changed. Current restoration goals are attempting to restore natural flow of fresh water into Biscayne and Florida Bays and to restore the natural vegetation, but first we must address of what the was environment prior to significant human alteration in order to establish targets for restoration. This project is designed to examine the natural patterns of temporal change in salinity, water quality, vegetation, and benthic fauna in Biscayne Bay over the last 100-300 years and to examine the causes of change.",
