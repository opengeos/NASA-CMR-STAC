    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 1224\nSee the link below for public details on this project.\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nIce core drilling is used to extract information from glacial ice, which aids in the reconstruction of past climatic conditions, and produces proxy records of environmental parameters.  The main aim of this project is to produce a record of methanesulphonic acid (MSA) over the last 1-2 decades, and investigate links with biological activity, and with sea-ice extent, in the Prydz Bay region.  To achieve this, ice core records will be extracted from the Amery Ice Shelf.  This work will also compliment the important Law Dome results by improving spatial coverage of high-resolution climate records and will contribute to the International Trans Antarctic Scientific Expedition (ITASE).\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo obtain ice cores for high-resolution environmental and climatic signals from the Prydz Bay region.\n\nTo produce a record of Methanesulphonic acid (MSA) over the 1-2 last decades, and to investigate teleconnections with indicators of biological activity from the Prydz Bay region, and links with sea-ice extent.\n\nOther parameters will also be determined (including major trace ions, oxygen isotopes and hydrogen peroxide) to define the dating and assist in interpretation of the MSA record.\n\nSix shallow cores (~5m) have been collected between 1999 and 2002 (G2, A506, AM1, AM2, AM3, and AM4).  Data for two of these cores are currently archived in the Australian Antarctic Data Centre (G2, A506).",
