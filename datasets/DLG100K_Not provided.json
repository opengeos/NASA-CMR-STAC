    "description": "Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLG's of map features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources. Intermediate-scale DLG data are derived from USGS 1:100,000-scale 30- by 60-minute  quadrangle maps. If these maps are not available, Bureau of Land Management planimetric maps at a scale of 1: 100,000 are used. Intermediate-scale DLG's are sold in five categories: (1)  Public Land Survey System; (2) boundaries (3) transportation; (4)  hydrography; and (5) hypsography.  All DLG data distributed by the USGS are DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a full range of attribute codes, have full topological structuring, and have passed certain quality-control checks.\n",
