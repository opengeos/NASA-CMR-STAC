    "description": "In December 2008, the RSV Aurora Australis had an opportunity to visit Heard Island and McDonald Islands. A number of activities took place and included:\n\n- An aerial survey (16th December) from the north coast of Red Island (west end) to the end of The Spit. The helicopter flew approximately 1.5 km offshore and at an altitude of about 1900 ft. Then it flew directly to the west coast and surveyed from Henderson Bluff to Kildalke. Video, stereo photos and photos of wildlife colonies and areas of interest were taken.  \n- An aerial survey (17th December) from The Spit travelling along the south coast. Then repeating the aerial survey of the 16th. The survey of the 16th was in dull light and was repeated on the 17th when light was better. \n- A ship-based survey from Atlas Roads to the north coast of The Spit was made on the 16th December and from Atlas Roads to Red Island on the 17th December. Stereo photos, photos of wildlife and named features and video were taken about 2nm offshore.\n- A team of people visited Atlas Cove and assessed the huts and ruins, took stereo photos of heritage items and elephant seals.\n- A small team flew around the Island and assessed and photographed the hut sites.\n- On the 17th December, the RSV Aurora Australis sailed past McDonald Islands. Visibility was poor so only a few photos were taken.  \n- Water samples were taken for AAS Project 2899.\n\nMore information is included in documents and spreadsheets, including some GPS locations of where photographs were taken, by whom and photo descriptions.",
