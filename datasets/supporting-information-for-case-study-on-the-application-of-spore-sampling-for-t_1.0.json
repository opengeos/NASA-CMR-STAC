    "description": "Resources associated with the manuscript *A case study on the application of spore sampling for the monitoring of macrofungi* ([Schlegel et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13941)).  Airborne environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring of fungi was evaluated on a species-rich grassland site. Extensive fruiting body surveys yielded 29 waxcap and clavarioid species, 19 of which were also detectable in air eDNA. The analysis indicates that spores of locally occurring fruiting bodies were detected, in addition to a large diversity of common fungal species, while rare and threatened species were under-represented in the air.  *Version 1* of the dataset was submitted during the review phase. *Version 2* contains minor changes and clarifications, and is up to date with the [published supplement](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2F1755-0998.13941&file=men13941-sup-0001-AppendixS1.pdf) of the study.  The contents of the ZIP archive:  * analysis scripts in [R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) format, including the rendered PDF output with figures and tables (*analysis* directory) * eDNA sample metadata (*amplicon_meta*) and results of the amplicon clustering (*amplicon_data*) and the source code of the pipeline (*amplicon_pipeline*) * positions of all fruiting body groups found in the surveys (3838 GPS points) (*surveys*) * positions of the spore traps, taxonomy of studied grassland fungi and red-list species, and many more resources  Please refer to `README.pdf` inside the archive for a complete description of the file structure and information on how to reproduce the analyses.",
