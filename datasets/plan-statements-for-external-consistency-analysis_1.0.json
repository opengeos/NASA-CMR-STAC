    "description": "The present dataset is part of the published scientific paper Bac\u0103u, S., Gr\u0103dinaru, S. R., & Hersperger, A. M. (2020). Spatial plans as relational data: Using social network analysis to assess consistency among Bucharest\u2019s planning instruments. Land Use Policy, 92.  The goal of this paper was to first develop a theoretical framework for external consistency assessment in spatial plans and then to test the framework with ten spatial plans of the Bucharest (Romania) region. Specifically, the paper has the following workflow: (i) to develop a framework for consistency assessment covering four categories of external consistency; (ii) to extract relevant plan statements from all plans on the four categories; (iii) to assign one-way, symmetrical and contradictory relationships between the extracted plan statements; and (iv) to assess consistencies, inconsistencies and contradictions between plans using directed and valued network analyses. All results were then validated by applying questionnaires to local experts.   The study focuses on a sample consisting of 10 spatial plans of Bucharest that: (1) are currently in force, (2) have spatial implications, (3) involve different administrative levels and (4) come from different planning sectors. The list of the reviewed planning documents can be found in Table 2 of the paper. The framework of consistency assessment contains 24 items, which can be found in Table 1 of the paper. All planning documents were read in respect to all items of the framework in order to extract plan statements used in the analysis. As a result, we provide the plan statement extracted from 10 plans on the 24 items of the framework. All data is in Romanian. The data was discussed qualitatively in the research paper.",
