    "description": "Taken from sections of the report:\n\nANARE planned geodetic survey work in the region in the summer 2000/2001. Initially it was planned to fly into the region from Davis wintering station on four separate days, allowing enough time to complete all the intended work. However owing to the harsh flying conditions and the nature of the terrain there was only time for two visits during the 2000 / 2001 summer season.\n\nAlthough only two trips were made into the Grove Mountains a number of outcomes were achieved they included:\n-Establishment of a new geodynamic survey monument in the vicinity of Mount Harding, to strengthen the Antarctic geodetic network, and also assist with long term monitoring of crustal motion in Antarctica.\n-Several days of GPS data collected on the existing geodetic network point at Austin Nunatak - 60km to the West of Mount Harding\n-Search for two existing CHINARE geodetic control points established near Mount Harding and Zakharoff Ridge.\n\nThe work was carried out by Gary Johnston, Paul Digney and John Manning working for the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (AUSLIG) - now Geoscience Australia (GA).",
