    "description": "In January 2001, a sea level monitoring station was installed near to the reverse osmosis intake near Scott Base. The data are transmitted from the sensor, to a data logger at Scott Base. Data is logged and archived including 5 minute sea level, air temperature and barometric pressure data.\n\nThe tide gauge records data at 5 minute intervals. Annually LINZ (Land Information New Zealand)calibrate the tide gauge over four tide cycles. A geodetic grade GPS receiver is set up on the sea ice near the tide gauge and another is set up on a permanent reference mark ashore. The GPS \u201cobserves\u201d the rise and fall of the tide by measuring the changing height of the sea ice.  A hole is drilled through the sea ice to enable the height of the reference point of the GPS receiver above the sea surface to be determined.  The relationship of the height of the shore-based reference mark and the zero of the sea level sensor is known.  These connections enable the height of the sea surface as determined by the sea level sensor to be compared to the height as determined by the GPS measurements.",
