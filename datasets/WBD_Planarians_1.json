    "description": "This metadata record has been created to describe a commercial CD product of the Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification. This CD has in no way been produced by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), and the metadata record is only intended as a reference for AAD employees.\n\nFrom the CD booklet:\n\nThis CD-ROM volume is dedicated to Marine Planarians of the World and is based upon work by Dr Ronald Sluys of the Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification.  It comprises a complete guide to all species in this Turbellarian group.  It is based on the treatise 'A Monograph on Marine Triclads'.\n\nThe introduction section of the program describes the general characteristics of Turbellarian flatworms and provides the user with details about the morphology, ecology and anatomy of the Maricola.\n\nThe higher taxa section gives information on 58 higher taxa, which are described in a similar way to the species.  In total, 404 drawings and pictures have been added to the CD-ROM, giving a complete and detailed overview of all taxa described.\n\nThe Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification (ETI) is a Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) in operational relation with UNESCO, dedicated to the production of scientific and educational computer software for the preservation of knowledge concerning the worlds plants and animals.  ETI is supported by The Netherlands Government, the University of Amsterdam, UNESCO, and other international organisations.  It cooperates with major scientific institutes around the world.",
