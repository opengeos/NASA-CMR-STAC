    "description": "Oceanographic measurements were conducted in the vicinity of the Mertz Polynya, encompassing 2 consecutive seasonal cycles from 1998 to 2000. In the southern winter of 1999, a total of 92 CTD/LADCP vertical profile stations were taken, most to within 20 m of the bottom, with 3 laps completed around the boundary of a box adjacent to the Mertz Glacier. Over 700 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, oxygen 18, dimethyl sulphide, and biological parameters, using a 12 bottle rosette sampler mounted on a 24 bottle frame. Additional CTD vertical profiles were taken in April 1998, July 1998 and February 2000. Near surface current data were collected on all cruises using ship mounted ADCP. Two mooring arrays comprising thermosalinographs, current meters and upward looking sonars were deployed in the region of the Polynya. The first array of 7 moorings was deployed in April 1998. The second array of 4 moorings was deployed in the winter of 1999. All 11 Polynya moorings were recovered in February 2000. A summary of all data and data quality is presented in the data report.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2223 and 189.",
