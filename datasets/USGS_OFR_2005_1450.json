    "description": "An assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Nevada Bureau of Mines and\nGeology (NBMG), and University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) is in progress of\nknown and undiscovered mineral resources of selected areas administered by the\nBureau of Land Management (BLM) in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada. The purpose\nof this work is to provide the BLM with information for use in their long-term\nplanning process in southern Nevada so that they can make better-informed\ndecisions.\n\nExisting information about the areas, including geology, geophysics,\ngeochemistry, and mineral-deposit information is being compiled, and field\nexaminations of selected areas and mineral occurrences have been conducted.\nThis information will be used to determine the geologic setting, metallogenic\ncharacteristics, and mineral potential of the areas.\n\nTwenty-five Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs) have been\nidentified by BLM as the object of this study. They range from tiny (less than\none square km) to large (more than 1,000 square km). This report includes\ngeochemical data for rock samples collected by the USGS and NBMG in these ACECs\nand nearby areas. Samples have been analyzed from the Big Dune, Ash Meadows,\nArden, Desert Tortoise Conservation Center, Coyote Springs Valley, Mormon Mesa,\nVirgin Mountains, Gold Butte A and B, Whitney Pockets, Rainbow Gardens, River\nMountains, and Piute-Eldorado Valley ACECs.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
