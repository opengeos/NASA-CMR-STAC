    "description": "NARSTO_EPA_SS_HOUSTON_TEXAQS2000_PM_SIZE_MASS is North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Supersite (SS) Houston, Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS2000) Formaldehyde and Hydrogen Peroxide Data. It contains continuous formaldehyde (HCHO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) measurements collected in August - September 2000 during TEXAQS2000 at the Houston Regional Monitoring (HRM) Site 3 monitoring station. Integrated single point measurements of 3-minute samples were collected every 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe Houston Supersite is one of several Supersites that was established in urban areas within the United States by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to better understand the measurement, sources, and health effects of suspended particulate matter (PM). The overall goals were to characterize the composition and identify the sources of PM in Southeastern Texas, to develop and test new methods for characterizing fine particulate matter, and to collect data on the physical and chemical characterization of fine PM that can be used to support exposure and health effects studies. \r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
