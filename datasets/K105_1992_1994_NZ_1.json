    "description": "A set of baseline data for the composition of meltwaters in the Ross Dependency, with particular concentrations on the levels of ultra trace heavy metals in waters remote from significant or current human activity was established. Water and soil samples were collected from pools, ponds, lakes and flowing waters at Cape Evans, Cape Royds, Marble Point and in the Wright Valley (all \"pristine\" sites which have not had any influence from human activities). Water was also sampled from sites intensively occupied by human activity including Scott Base and Vanda Station. The samples were compared with the baseline data to determine the nature and extent of contamination resulting from human activity. Samples were collected under sterile methods and analysed for trace metals components such as Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, Fe, Cr, Mn and As, using the 'totally recoverable', acid soluble and dissolved techniques. Each technique gives different information as to the bioavailability of the metals and hence the toxicity of the waters. Major anion analysis was performed using ion chromatography and titrations. Water samples were taken in the following season from the same sites (where possible) for analysis of mercury content.",
