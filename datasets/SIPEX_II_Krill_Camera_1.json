    "description": "The intention of the Deep Krill Camera and Trap System was to monitor and capture krill found during deep CTD operations.\n\nTwo traps were installed on the CTD in place of Niskin Bottles.  At pre-determined depths an internal light was illuminated and the traps were opened.   After a set period of time a second trigger signal was sent to the traps, closing the entry point, encapsulating any Krill that were inside.\n\nThe Krill Camera system was installed onto the CTD rosette.  It consisted of a high-definition video camera (a GoPro Hero 2) within a pressure housing, flanked by two LED light sources.  The power for this system was supplied via a rechargeable battery pack also mounted to the CTD.\n\nThe camera system was remotely controlled from the surface via the CTD communications link.  At specific depths the lights and camera were activated, recording the water column and ocean floor by adjusting focus length for fixed durations in an attempt to document Krill at lower depths. \n\nAn additional camera was introduced into the system, mounted to allow video capture of the Krill Trap Operation.  This camera was set to record at the beginning of the operations and left running for the duration of the deployment.\n\nVideo data from the Krill camera is in MTS format, which can be opened with VLC Media Player.\nTrap footage is recorded in MP4 format, which can be opened with Quicktime or VLC Media Player.\n\nTrap triggering and camera operation data was recorded manually by Rob King.",
