    "description": "Measurements were made on the following inputs into the beach system of Cape Bird: the tides, wave height, current velocities and directions, wind conditions and air temperature to examine which daily energy conditions were conducive to particular changes in the total sequence of observed changes in morphology and sediments. 14 profiles along the beach were re-surveyed 6 times during the season to graph the qualitative and volumetric analysis of changes in the beach. 200 sediment samples were taken from the beach and analysed to provide another line of evidence as to temporal changes and as to longshore drift. Initial samples were taken from each major change in sediment characteristics on each profile. Subsequent samples were taken from areas of the beach that were exhibiting evidence of change.  An offshore survey was completed with a bathymetry chart kept and sediments sampled. Offshore traverses were completed normal to the shore for bathymetric study and sediment records. The results were compared with Cape Royds and Marble Point.",
