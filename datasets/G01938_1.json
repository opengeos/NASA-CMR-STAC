    "description": "The Arctic Meteorology and Climate Atlas is part of the <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/data/ewg\">NOAA@NSIDC Environmental Working Group (EWG) Atlases</a> data collection.\n\nThe Arctic Meteorology and Climate Atlas was developed in the late 1990s by specialists from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia, the University of Washington, Seattle, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, University of Colorado, Boulder. The Atlas contains three main sections: a history section, a Primer, and a data section. The history section summarizes Arctic exploration from both Russian and U.S. vantage points.  It includes a condensed translation of an AARI publication detailing the Russian North Pole drifting station program, as well as a photo gallery from the North Pole stations. The Primer provides introductory information for newcomers to arctic meteorology. The data section contains gridded fields of meteorological parameters. These maps of air temperature, sea level pressure, precipitation, cloud cover, and snow and solar radiation from drifting and coastal stations can be browsed using an included viewer.  Meteorological station data from Russian and other sources, newly released at the time the atlas was published, is included as well. In addition, the Atlas includes several English translations of Russian technical documents, and a glossary of meteorological terms in English and Russian. See the User Guide for a more complete listing of contents. The online User Guide includes an important Addendum and Errata section that is not included in the documentation that accompanies the Atlas download.",
