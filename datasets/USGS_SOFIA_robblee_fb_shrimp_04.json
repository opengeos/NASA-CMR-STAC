    "description": "The objectives of these activities are broadly: 1) to develop and implement (with other agency members) a program of research to support the restoration of Florida Bay; 2) with other PDT members to develop and evaluate restoration alternatives for Florida Bay and 3) with other committee members to develop performance measures and assess restoration alternatives affecting Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, Barnes Sound and Manatee Bay and the lower southwest coast mangrove estuaries.\n\nFlorida Bay lies downstream of the Everglades ecosystem. Perceived deterioration of the Everglades over the last century - and Florida Bay since the mid-1980\u0092s - is generally viewed as linked to changes in freshwater flow and water quality associated with water management in South Florida. The pink shrimp is a species of special interest in each of the above studies because it has been chosen as an indicator species for use in restoration of south Florida estuaries. Empirical and experimental data developed in these studies will be used to support the development of a pink shrimp landscape simulation model and restoration performance measures.",
