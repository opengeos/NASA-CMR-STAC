    "description": "Korean Antarctic survey carried out as in year 1 of 'the Antarctic Undersea Geological Survey' was conducted at the end of 1994 was conducted Multi-channel Seismic Investgation and Drilling investigation in the central basin of the Bransfield Strait was located in between the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands and the Maxwell Bay area near Sejong Station. The field research was conducted wih other research at the same time. The research period was from 11 Dec. in 1994 to 23 Jan. in 1995 (13 days). \n- Korean Antarctic survey carried out as part of step 1 project in year 1 to investigate the possibility of oil resources in the Bransfield Strait of Antarctica.\n- Securing data for tectonic settings research in the same region.\n- Obtaining basic data for understanding marine geology and sedimentary layers in the same region.",
