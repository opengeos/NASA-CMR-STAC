    "description": "The International Programme for Antarctic Buoys (IPAB) is run by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). IPAB is a self-sustaining project of the WCRP, and provides a link between institutions with Antarctic and Southern Ocean interests. IPAB was formally established, following a one year pilot phase, at a meeting in Helsinki, Finland in June 1994. IPAB aims to establish and maintain a network of drifting buoys in the Antarctic sea-ice zone, which monitor ice motion, pressure and temperature. In 1997, 16 organisations, representing 11 countries, were involved in the IPAB programme, including: Alfred Wegener Institute, Antarctic CRC, Australian Antarctic Division, British Antarctic Survey, Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology, INPE -National Institute for Space Research, Institute for Marine Research and University of Helsinki, Hydrographic Department, Maritime Safety Agency, National Ice Center, National Institute of Polar Research, Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antardtide, Scott Polar Research Institute, Service Argos, South African Weather Bureau, United Kingdom Meteorological Office, and World Data Center A Glaciology. Tables of data availability, information, experiment details, literature, and data sets are available from the IPAB home page. Links are also available to databases held by other organisations, and links to Arctic and Indian Ocean buoy databases.\n\nThe data are available via several provided URLs.  Further information and the data can be obtained from the IPAB home page URL.  The data and documentation are also available directly from the NSIDC website.  Finally, an older copy of the data are also held locally on the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's servers.\n\nThe documentation held at the NSIDC website provides important information on interpreting the dataset.  A static copy of this document is included with the local copy of the dataset held on the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's servers.\n\nData from January 1995 to July 1998 only has been made available on the NSIDC website (and correspondingly on the AADC's servers).  More data should be available soon.\n\nThis work was also completed as part of ASAC projects 732, 742 and 2678.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nBuoy Number\nYear\nTime\nLongitude\nLatitude\nARGOS Positional Accuracy\nSea Ice Flag\nAir Pressure\nAir Temperature\nWater Temperature\nVelocity",
