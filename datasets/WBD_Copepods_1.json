    "description": "This metadata record has been created to describe a commercial CD product of the Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification. This CD has in no way been produced by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), and the metadata record is only intended as a reference for AAD employees.\n\nFrom the CD booklet:\n\nThis CD-ROM covers The Calanoid Copepods of the Family Aetideidae of the World Ocean and was made by Dr Elena L. Markhaseva. This work contains a comprehensive and fully up-to-date account of Aetideidae, including extensive species descriptions (with more than 2600 illustrations).  A new and highly detailed illustrated key provides easy access to the information on the taxa. An interactive glossary of terms forms part of this unique program that provides information on 165 species (including 2 subspecies) and 34 higher taxa.  Principal literature references are also included.\n\nThe Aetideidae are an important family of the Calanoida that form an order of the Copepoda (Crustacea).  Most calanoids are free living and marine, though some groups are restricted to freshwater.  The majority of species are planktonic, but some live on, or close to, the ocean floor.  They represent the dominant group within the organisms that make up the marine zooplankton, and form a very important link in the food chain of the aquatic environment.\n\nThe family Aetideidae occurs in all vertical ranges of the marine pelagic zone and also inhabits the hyperbenthic environment.  In order to obtain comprehensive information on the geographical distribution of the presented cosmopolitan calanoid family, the present program was based on material from numerous localities in the world's oceans.\n\nThe work was performed primarily at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (St Petersburg), using the museum's collections.\n\nThe Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification (ETI) is a Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) in operational relation with UNESCO, dedicated to the production of scientific and educational computer software for the preservation of knowledge concerning the worlds plants and animals.  ETI is supported by The Netherlands Government, the University of Amsterdam, UNESCO, and other international organisations.  It cooperates with major scientific institutes around the world.",
