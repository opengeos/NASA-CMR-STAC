    "description": "Taken from the \"Supporting Information\" for the main paper.  See the referenced papers for more information.\n\nOur results are based on numerical simulation of Southern Ocean sea ice, conducted using the Los Alamos numerical sea-ice model CICE version 4.0 [CICE4; Bailey et al., 2010] configured in stand-alone mode on a 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree grid, extending to 45 degrees S, with 3-hourly output [Stevens, 2013]. The atmospheric forcing for CICE4 came from the hemispheric forecasting model Polar Limited Area Prediction Systems [Polar- LAPS; Adams, 2006] and ocean forcing from the global ocean general circulation model Australian Climate Ocean Model [AusCOM; Bi and Marsland, 2010]. The model is well-constrained in its representation of processes of sea ice formation and melt, and comparison with observed areal ice extent shows minimal deviations over the 1998-2003 period, particularly during winter [Stevens 2013]. Stevens [2013] evaluates the sensitivity of the model to the number of ice thickness categories. Sea ice thickness sensitivities in the CICE model are considered in detail in Hunke [2010, 2014].\n\nFor the warm climate scenario, changes were implemented that are consistent with the A1B scenario from the Fourth Assessment from the IPCC [Meehl et al., 2007]. This is a mid-range scenario that assumes rapid economic growth before introduction of new and more efficient technologies mid century. Specifically, the following changes were applied uniformly to the current climate forcing field for a single year: a 2 degrees C increase in air temperature, a 0.2 mm/day increase in rain, a 1.5% increase in cloud fraction, a -2.3 hPa change in surface air pressure, a 25% increase in wind, a 12 Wm-2 increase in long wave downward radiation and a 20% increase in humidity.\n\nOutputs and forcings from CICE4 that are relevant for consideration of under-ice habitats for larval krill include: snow depth, ice thickness, ice concentration, movement, ridging rate, day length (dependent on day-of-year and latitude), radiation above the ice (influenced by cloud cover), and radiation below the ice (influenced by ice and snow depth). Table 1 in the main text describes how these were used in the following two filters and one overlay for evaluating the location and suitability of potential larval krill habitat during winter.\n\nTaken from the abstract of the main paper:\n\nOver-wintering of larvae underneath Antarctic pack ice is a critical stage in the life cycle of Antarctic krill. However, there are no circumpolar assessments of available habitat for larval krill, making it difficult to evaluate how climate change may impact this life stage. We use outputs from a circumpolar sea-ice model, together with a set of simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. In particular we assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three dimensional complexity of the sea ice. We then compare the combined area of these regions under current conditions to that under a warm climate scenario. Results indicate that, while total areal sea-ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions. These findings highlight that decreases in sea-ice extent may not necessarily be detrimental for krill populations and underline the complexity of predicting future trajectories for this key species in the Antarctic ecosystem.",
