    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L3 STA Map Sea surface temperature (day/night separately averaged) (8days,9km) is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km.  This product includes Sea surface temperature (day/night separately averaged) which applied the cloud detection and the atmospheric correction. The former is the process to find clear, or no cloud-contaminated, pixels in the image. The combination of the threshold tests is used to detect clouds. The latter is needed to obtain SST of clear pixels from the brightness temperatures observed by GLI. This product is the representative values, which are estimated from level 3 binned products and projected onto map. The provided format is HDF. The physical quantity is Kelvin. The spatial resolution is 9km. The statistical period is 8 days, also 1 day and 1month statistics are available. Map projection is EQR. The generation unit is global. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
