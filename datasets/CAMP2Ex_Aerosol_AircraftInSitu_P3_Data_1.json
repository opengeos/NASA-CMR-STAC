    "description": "CAMP2Ex_Aerosol_AircraftInSitu_P3_Data are in-situ aerosol measurements conducted onboard the P-3 aircraft during the Clouds, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes-Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) NASA field study. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nCAMP2Ex was a NASA field study, with three main science objectives: aerosol effect on cloud microphysical and optical properties, aerosol and cloud influence on radiation as well as radiative feedback, and meteorology effect on aerosol distribution and aerosol-cloud interactions. Research on these three main objectives requires a comprehensive characterization of aerosol, cloud, and precipitation properties, as well as the associated meteorological and radiative parameters. Trace gas tracers are also needed for airmass type analysis to characterize the role of anthropogenic and natural aerosols. To deliver these observations, CAMP2Ex utilized a combination of remote sensing and in-situ measurements. NASA\u2019s P-3B aircraft was equipped with a suite of in-situ instruments to conduct measurements of aerosol and cloud properties, trace gases, meteorological parameters, and radiative fluxes. The P-3B was also equipped passive remote sensors (i.e. lidar, polarimeter, radar, and radiometers). A second aircraft, the SPEC Learjet 35A, was primarily dedicated to measuring detailed cloud microphysical properties. The sampling strategy designed for CAMP2Ex coordinated flight plans for both aircraft to maximize the science return. The P-3B was used primarily to conduct remote sensing measurements of cloud and precipitation structure and aerosol layers and vertical profiles of atmospheric state variable, while the Learjet flew below the P-3B to obtain the detailed cloud microphysical properties. During the 2019 field deployment in the vicinity of the Philippines, completed from August 20-October 10, the P-3B conducted 19 science flights and the SPEC Learjet conducted 11 flights. Ground-based aerosol observations were also recorded in 2018 and 2019. CAMP2Ex was completed in partnership with Philippine research and operational weather communities. Measurements completed during CAMP2EX provide a 4-D observational view of the environment of the Philippines and its neighboring waters in terms of microphysical, hydrological, dynamical, thermodynamical and radiative properties of the environment, targeting the environment of shallow cumulus and cumulus congestus clouds.",
