    "description": "In 1968 the Australian Antarctic Division had a group of four men spend over a year on the Amery Ice Shelf. As part of their program of work, they drilled a number of boreholes on the shelf and took temperature readings at various depths down the hole. Stratigraphy notes and density measurements were also made on the holes drilled.\n\nThe records of the recorded temperatures, notes on the temperature probes used, stratigraphy and density measurements, and a few notes on the work carried out, have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division. \n\nLogbook(s):\nGlaciology Borehole Measurements, Amery 1968 - Borehole tempurature readings Glaciology Borehole Logs, Amery 1968 - Stratigraphy and density measurements\n\nAMERY ICE SHELF PARTY - February 1968 to February 1969 all IN on V2(67-68) all OUT on V2(68-69)\nOfficer-in-Charge: Maxwell John Corry\nMedical Officer: Julian R Sansom\nEngineer(Electronics): Alan H F Nickols Senior Diesel Mechanic: Neville Joseph Collins \n\nConducted a glaciological program including ice drilling and surveying the Lambert Glacier",
