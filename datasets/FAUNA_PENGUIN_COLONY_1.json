    "description": "This dataset is a census of penguin colony counts from the year 1900 in the Antarctic region. It forms part of the Inventory of Antarctic seabird breeding sites within the Antarctic and subantarctic islands. The Antarctic and subantarctic fauna database (seabirds) is a database detailing the distribution and abundance of breeding localities for Antarctic and Subantarctic seabirds. Each species' compilation was produced by members of the SCAR Bird Biology Subcommittee. \n\nThis separate metadata record has been created beacause it represents only the penguin colony counts that have been published to OBIS. Note: The Year (not day or month) date is only relevent in this dataset. The positions that have been published to OBIS include latitude and longitude positions that were not included within the original dataset. The latitude and longitude positions that were not noted by the observer have been created from the locality given by the observer using the Antarctic Composite Gazetteer.\n\nTwo spreadsheets are available for download, from the URL given below.  The original, unmodified spreadsheet is available, as well as a corrected spreadsheet.  In the corrected spreadsheet, the AADC has attempted to reconcile the poorly presented localities into a single column.  It is possible that some of these localities may not be correct.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n      \nSCAR Number\nSpecies\nRegion\nLocality\nLongitude\nLatitude\nNumber of Colonies\nNumber of Pairs\nType and accuracy of count\nData Date\nReferences\nRemarks\n\nThese data are further referenced in ANARE Research Notes 9 - see reference below.",
