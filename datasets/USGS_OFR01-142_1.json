    "description": "This is a spatial database that delineates mining-related features in areas of\nhistoric and active phosphate mining in the core of the southeastern Idaho\nphosphate resource area.  The data has varying degrees of accuracy and\nattribution detail. The breakdown of areas by type of activity at active mines\nis detailed; however, the disturbed areas at many of the closed or inactive\nmines are not subdivided into specific categories detailing the type of\nactivity that occurred.\n\nNineteen phosphate mine sites are included in the study. A total of 5,728 hc\n(14,154 ac), or more than 57 km2 (22 mi2), of phosphate mining-related surface\ndisturbance are documented in the spatial coverage of the core of the southeast\nIdaho phosphate resource area. The study includes 4 active phosphate minebsDry\nValley, Enoch Valley, Rasmussen Ridge, and Smoky Canyobnand 15 historic\nphosphate minebsBallard, Champ, Conda, Diamond Gulch, Gay, Georgetown Canyon,\nHenry, Home Canyon, Lanes Creek, Maybe Canyon, Mountain Fuel, Trail Canyon,\nRattlesnake Canyon, Waterloo, and Wooley Valley. Spatial data on the inactive\nhistoric mines is relatively up-to-date; however, spatially described areas for\nactive mines are based on digital maps prepared in early 1999. The inactive Gay\nmine has the largest total area of disturbance: 1,917 hc (4,736 ac) or about 19\nkm2 (7.4 mi2). It encompasses over three times the disturbance area of the next\nlargest mine, the Conda mine with 607 hc (1,504 ac), and it is nearly four\ntimes the area of the Smoky Canyon mine, the largest of the active mines with\n497 hc (1,228 ac).\n\nThe wide range of phosphate mining-related surface disturbance features\n(approximately 80) were reduced to 13 types or features used in this studbyadit\nand pit, backfilled mine pit, facilities, mine pit, ore stockpile, railroad,\nroad, sediment catchment, tailings or tailings pond, topsoil stockpile, water\nreservoir, and disturbed land (undifferentiated). In summary, the spatial\ncoverage includes polygons totaling 1,114 hc (2,753 ac) of mine pits, 272 hc\n(671 ac) of backfilled mine pits, 1,570 hc (3,880 ac) of waste dumps, 26 hc (64\nac) of ore stockpiles, and 44 hc (110 ac) of tailings or tailings ponds. Areas\nof undifferentiated phosphate mining-related land disturbances, called bed\nland,b site-specific studies to delineate distinct mine features will allow\nmodification of this preliminary spatial database.",
