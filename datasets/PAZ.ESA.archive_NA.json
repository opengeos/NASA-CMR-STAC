    "description": "The PAZ ESA archive collection consists of PAZ Level 1 data previously requested by ESA supported projects over their areas of interest around the world and, as a consequence, the products are scattered and dispersed worldwide and in different time windows. The dataset regularly grows as ESA collects new products over the years. Available modes are: \u2022\tStripMap mode (SM): SSD less than 3m for a scene 30km x 50km in single polarization or 15km x 50km in dual polarisation \u2022\tScanSAR mode (SC): the scene is 100 x 150 km2, SSD less than 18m in signle pol only \u2022\tWide ScanSAR mode (WS): single polarisation only, with SS less than 40m and scene size of 270 x 200 km2 \u2022\tSpotlight modes (SL): SSD less than 2m for a scene 10km x 10km, both single and dual polarization are available \u2022\tHigh Resolution Spotlight mode (HS): in both single and dual polarisation, the scene is 10x5 km2, SSD less than 1m \u2022\tStaring Spotlight mode (ST): SSD is 25cm, the scene size is 4 x 4 km2, in single polarisation only. The available geometric projections are: \u2022\tSingle Look Slant Range Complex (SSC): single look product, no geocoding, no radiometric artifact included, the pixel spacing is equidistant in azimuth and in ground range \u2022\tMulti Look Ground Range Detected (MGD): detected multi look product, simple polynomial slant-to-ground projection is performed in range, no image rotation to a map coordinate system is performed  \u2022\tGeocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC): multi look detected product, projected and re-sampled to the WGS84 reference ellipsoid with no terrain corrections \u2022\tEnhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC): multi look detected product, projected and re-sampled to the WGS84 reference ellipsoid, the image distortions caused by varying terrain height are corrected using a DEM The following table summarises the offered product types EO-SIP product type\tOperation Mode\tGeometric Projection PSP_SM_SSC\tStripmap (SM)\tSingle Look Slant Range Complex (SSC) PSP_SM_MGD\tStripmap (SM)\tMulti Look Ground Range Detected (MGD) PSP_SM_GEC\tStripmap (SM)\tGeocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) PSP_SM_EEC\tStripmap (SM)\tEnhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC) PSP_SC_MGD\tScanSAR (SC)\tSingle Look Slant Range Complex (SSC) PSP_SC_GEC\tScanSAR (SC)\tMulti Look Ground Range Detected (MGD) PSP_SC_EEC\tScanSAR (SC)\tGeocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) PSP_SC_SSC\tScanSAR (SC)\tEnhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC) PSP_SL_SSC\tSpotlight (SL)\tSingle Look Slant Range Complex (SSC) PSP_SL_MGD\tSpotlight (SL)\tMulti Look Ground Range Detected (MGD) PSP_SL_GEC\tSpotlight (SL)\tGeocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) PSP_SL_EEC\tSpotlight (SL)\tEnhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC) PSP_HS_SSC\tHigh Resolution Spotlight (HS)\tSingle Look Slant Range Complex (SSC) PSP_HS_MGD\tHigh Resolution Spotlight (HS)\tMulti Look Ground Range Detected (MGD) PSP_HS_GEC\tHigh Resolution Spotlight (HS)\tGeocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) PSP_HS_EEC\tHigh Resolution Spotlight (HS)\tEnhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC) PSP_ST_SSC\tStaring Spotlight (ST)\tSingle Look Slant Range Complex (SSC) PSP_ST_MGD\tStaring Spotlight (ST)\tMulti Look Ground Range Detected (MGD) PSP_ST_GEC\tStaring Spotlight (ST)\tGeocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) PSP_ST_EEC\tStaring Spotlight (ST)\tEnhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC) PSP_WS_SSC\tWide ScanSAR (WS)\tSingle Look Slant Range Complex (SSC) PSP_WS_MGD\tWide ScanSAR (WS)\tMulti Look Ground Range Detected (MGD) PSP_WS_GEC\tWide ScanSAR (WS)\tGeocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) PSP_WS_EEC\tWide ScanSAR (WS)\tEnhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC)",
