    "description": "Forward processing of VNP03MODLL Version 1 data product was discontinued on June 17, 2024. Users are encouraged to use Version 2 data products, which provide [better calibration and consistency](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/userguide/VIIRS_Land_C2_Changes_09152022.pdf) for the end user. VIIRS Version 2 data products are available from both the SNPP ([VNP03MODLL](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP03MODLL.002)) and NOAA-20 ([VJ103MODLL]( https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VJ103MODLL.002)) satellites.\n\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Moderate Resolution Terrain Correction Geolocation (VNP03MODLL) Version 1 product from the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) VIIRS sensor is produced in 6 minute temporal satellite increments (swaths) at 750 meter resolution.  Intersecting the VIIRS line of sight vector with Earth's geoid and the World Geodetic System (WGS) ellipsoid, this product is based on the SRTM30 Version 2 digital elevation model (DEM), which uses GTOPO30 data for areas from 60\u00b0 North to 60\u00b0 South. VNP03MODLL is a terrain correction geolocation product that provides the spatial location for various VIIRS data products.  Each swath of data is approximately 3,060 kilometers along track (long) and 3,060 kilometers across track (wide). \n\nProvided in the VNP03MODLL product are layers for height, latitude, and longitude. \n\nThese Science Data Sets (SDS) layers are used in conjunction with the [VNP14](https://doi.org/10.5067/viirs/vnp14.001) swath product for accurate geolocation information.\n\nKnown Issues\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QS/new/pages.cgi?name=known_issues).",
