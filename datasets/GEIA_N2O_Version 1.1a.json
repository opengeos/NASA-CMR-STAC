    "description": "The Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) is an activity of the\n      International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Core Project of the\n      International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP).  The focus of GEIA\n      is to make global emissions available on a one degree grid.\n      \n      Inventories with 1x1 degree resolution were compiled of nitrous oxide\n      (N2O) emissions from fertilized arable land, animal excreta,\n      post-clearing effects on soil emissions, fossil fuel and fuelwood\n      combustion and industrial N2O sources. For other sources of N2O,\n      including soils under natural vegetation, oceans and biomass burning,\n      published inventories were used. From these inventories the annual N2O\n      emission was calculated for four broad latitudinal zones covering the\n      globe. Uncertainties were assessed by comparing variants of\n      inventories with source estimates inferred from inverse modeling\n      techniques. Major uncertainties occur in the tropics, where small\n      errors in both soil and oceanic emission estimates may have large\n      repercussions for the zonal distributions. Although there may still be\n      many poorly known and unidentified N2O sources, the analysis has\n      resulted in improved understanding of some sources i.e.: (i) the\n      oceanic N2O emission may be more important than assumed in recent\n      global N2O budgets, with a major portion stemming from the 30o-90oS\n      zone; (ii) the N2O emission from animal excreta forms a significant\n      global source; (iii) most of the N2O from arable lands and grasslands,\n      including effects of synthetic fertilizers and animal excreta, comes\n      from the northern hemisphere; accounting for only the\n      synthetic-fertilizer effect on N2O emission leads to an\n      underestimation of the emission from arable lands; (iv) fossil fuel\n      combustion and industrial N2O sources are dominant in the 30o-90oN\n      zone, while N2O from fuelwood combustion is mainly produced in the\n      0o-30oN zone; (v) the estimation of enhanced N2O soil emission\n      following tropical forest clearing that has accounted for gradually\n      declining N2O fluxes, along with aging of the clearing leads to a\n      global emission that is significant but lower than previous estimates;\n      (vi) most of the N2O from coastal marine and freshwater systems, and\n      soil N2O emission resulting from N deposition probably comes from the\n      northern hemisphere.\n      \n      More information about GEIA, its products, and the data\n      presented here can be accessed at\n      \"http://geiacenter.org\"",
