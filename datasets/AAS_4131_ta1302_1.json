    "description": "Oceanographic measurements were collected aboard New Zealand\u2019s National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) research vessel RV Tangaroa, cruise ta1302 (i.e. NIWA cruise tan1302), from 3rd February to 13th March 2013, sailing from and returning to Wellington. The cruise commenced with a series of stations at the southern end of CLIVAR/WOCE meridional section SR3, followed by work around and offshore of the former Mertz Glacier ice tongue and the Mertz Depression. A series of stations were then taken along 150E and CLIVAR/WOCE zonal section S4, followed by a series of stations on the Campbell Plateau on the transit back to New Zealand. Details of all programs on the cruise, including lowered ADCP data, carbon sampling, geological coring and grabs, bottom camera footage, multibeam data, Argo float deployments and cruise participants, can be found in the voyage report (\u201cRV Tangaroa Voyage Report, Tan1302 \u2013 Mertz Polynya Voyage\u201d, unpublished NIWA report, authored by voyage participants). This report discusses the oceanographic data from CTD operations on the cruise.\n\nThe original primary aim of the cruise was recovery and redeployment of an array of Australian (ACECRC) and French (LOCEAN) moorings in the Mertz region, along with CTD data collection on the shelf. Sea ice cover prevented access by Tangaroa (for the most part) to the shelf, and to any of the mooring sites, and so a secondary project was undertaken - collecting CTD\u2019s on the slope and in canyons offshore of the sea ice.\n\nA total of 86 CTD vertical profile stations were taken on the cruise, most to within 12 metres of the bottom. Over 1400 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (silicate and nitrate+nitrite), dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. TCO2), alkalinity, and isotopes (oxygen, hydrogen and carbon), using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Full depth current profiles were collected by an LADCP attached to the CTD package. Meteorological and water property data were collected by the array of ship's underway sensors. The vessel mounted ADCP, rigged to a pole in the ship\u2019s moonpool, was lost on the transit south. This report describes the processing/calibration of the CTD data, and details the data quality.",
