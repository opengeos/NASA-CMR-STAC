    "description": "The products offered by the Hydroweb project consist of continuous, long-duration time-series of the levels of large lakes with surface areas over 100 km2, reservoirs and the 20 biggest rivers in the world.The operational measurement series are updated no later than 1.5 days after a new altimetry measurement becomes available. They cover about 80 large lakes and 300 measurement points along about 20 major rivers.The research measurement series are updated at regular intervals according to the progress made with processing by the LEGOS laboratory. They cover about 150 large lakes and 1,000 measurement points along about 20 major rivers.Continental waters account for only 0.65% of the total amount of water on Earth, 97% being stored in the oceans and 2.15% in the cryosphere. However, these waters have a significant impact on life on Earth and household needs. They also play a major role in climate variability. Water on Earth is continually recycled through precipitation, evaporation and run-off towards the sea. The increasingly accurate characterisation of the water cycle on land surfaces enables more accurate forecasting of the climate and more careful control of global water resources (human consumption and activities such as agriculture, urbanisation and the production of hydroelectric power, for example).\nAltimetry  missions  used  are  repetitive,  i.e.  the  satellite  overflow  the  same  point  at  a  given  time interval  (10,  17  or  35  days  depending  on  the  satellite).  The  satellite  does  not  deviate  from  more than +/-1 km across its track. A given lake can be overflown by several satellites, with potentially several passes. The  water  level  and  volume  time  series  is  operationally  updated  less  than  1.5 working  days  after the  availability  of  the  input  altimetry  data,  for some lakes.  Other lakes  are  also  monitored  on  a research mode basis.\n[https://www.theia-land.fr/fr/projets/hydroweb]",
