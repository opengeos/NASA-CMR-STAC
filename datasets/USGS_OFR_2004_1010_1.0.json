    "description": "Workshops in 2001 and 2002 were convened to determine critical issues in the\ndevelopment of tsunami inundation maps for the Puget Sound region. The Tsunami\nInundation Mapping Effort (TIME) is conducted under the multi-agency National\nTsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP). The Puget Sound Tsunami/Landslide\nWorkshop in 2001 focused on integrated tsunami research involving a wide range\nof research studies and tsunami hazard mitigation issues. The 2002 Puget Sound\nTsunami Sources workshop (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003) made specific recommendations\nfor tsunami source modeling and improving our state of knowledge for sources in\nthe Puget Sound region. One of the recommendations stated in Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\n(2003) is \"Develop methods to assess the sensitivity of coastal areas to\ntsunami inundation, based on multiple simulations that reflect the possible\nrange of variations in the source parameters.\" Tsunami inundation models rely\nheavily on the imposed initial conditions which, for an earthquake source, is\nthe coseismic vertical displacement field. For example, Koshimura et al. (2002)\nuse the geologic uplift observations (Buknam et al., 1992) to constrain the\nslip distribution for the event that occurred 1100 years ago, resulting in an\naverage slip of 3.7 m and a magnitude of 7.6. Walsh et al. (2003) develop a\ntsunami inundation map for Elliot Bay based on a M 7.3 earthquake and the\ngeologic uplift observations from the 1100 y.b.p. event as in Koshimura et al.\n(2002), though they use a constant fault dip of 60\u00b0 rather than different dips\nfor deep and shallow segments. The objective of this report is to examine how\ncoseismic vertical displacement from a smaller M 6.5 Seattle Fault earthquake\n(as in Hartzell et al., 2002) is affected by structural heterogeneity and\ndifferent slip distribution patterns.\n\nThe three-dimensional crustal structure of the Puget Sound region has recently\nbeen defined using shallow seismic reflection data (Pratt et al., 1997; Johnson\net al., 1999) and reflection and wide-angle recordings from the large-scale\nSHIPS experiments (e.g., Brocher et al., 2001; ten Brink et al., 2002). The\npresence of a deep sedimentary basin (Seattle Basin) adjacent to the Seattle\nFault has led to the question of whether structural heterogeneity has an effect\non our estimate of vertical displacement for earthquake scenarios in the\nregion. We use a three-dimensional elastic finite-element model (Yoshioka et\nal., 1989) to calculate vertical displacements from rupture on a two-segment\n(deep and shallow) Seattle fault using a heterogeneous crustal structure.\nSimilar studies by Geist and Yoshioka (1996) and Masterlark et al. (2001) used\nthree-dimensional, finite-element models (FEM) to study the effect of\nstructural heterogeneity on coseismic displacement fields. Results for the\nPuget Sound study are compared to calculations using a homogeneous structure as\nassumed with conventional elastic dislocation solutions. Effects of slip\ndistribution patterns on vertical displacement is computed using the stochastic\nsource model adopted for tsunami studies by Geist (2002). Finally, we examine\nan alternate model for shallow faulting proposed by ten Brink et al. (2002) and\nBrocher et al. (submitted) and its effect on the vertical displacement field.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
