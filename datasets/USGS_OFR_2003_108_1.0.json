    "description": "A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was used to map the relative vulnerability\nof the coast to future sea-level rise within Gulf Islands National Seashore\n(GUIS) in Mississippi and Florida. The CVI ranks the following in terms of\ntheir physical contribution to sea-level rise-related coastal change:\ngeomorphology, regional coastal slope, rate of relative sea-level rise,\nshoreline change rates, mean tidal range and mean wave height. The rankings for\neach variable were combined and an index value calculated for 1-minute grid\ncells covering the park. The CVI highlights those regions where the physical\neffects of sea-level rise might be the greatest. This approach combines the\ncoastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to\nchanging environmental conditions, yielding a quantitative, although relative,\nmeasure of the park's natural vulnerability to the effects of sea-level rise.\nThe Gulf Islands in Mississippi and Florida consist of stable and washover\ndominated portions of barrier beach backed by wetland and marsh. The areas\nlikely to be most vulnerable to sea-level rise are those with the highest\noccurrence of overwash, the highest rates of shoreline change, the gentlest\nregional coastal slope, and the highest rates of relative sea-level rise. The\nCVI provides an objective technique for evaluation and long-term planning by\nscientists and park managers.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
