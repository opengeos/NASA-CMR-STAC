    "description": "A quantitative survey of the ecology of mosses in the McMurdo Sound region was conducted in the 1976/77 field season. Moss was found around streams below the Rhone, Hughes and Calkin Glaciers in the Taylor Valley, the moraines below the Hobbs Glacier and in the Salmon, Garwood and Towle Valleys, and in the Scott Base, McMurdo Station areas. Other areas searched where moss was not found included Kennar and Beacon Valleys, the area below La Croix Glacier and the side of the Taylor Valley around Lake Conney not near melt streams below alpine glaciers and the Towle Valley. Algae and lichen were recorded from most of the areas visited.  Detailed quantitative surveys of moss were done below the Rhone, Calkin and Hughes Glacier and on the delta below the snout of the Hobbs Glacier. Air spore samples were collected daily, fresh algae was collected from Lake Fryxell and Lake Vanda for C14 dating standards and soils were sampled for tests for microorganisms, pH, carbon and nitrogen content.",
