    "description": "Satellite imagery of the McMurdo Sound region was studied to test the usefulness of remote sensing and enhanced satellite imagery as a means of studying the distrubution of weathered soil in Antarctica. Areas in the Asgard Range where strongly weathered soils with high colours were known to occur were selected and their characteristic spectral reflectance pattern was determined. Colour prints of the region were prepared with areas showing the same characteristic reflectance pattern emphasised. The ground was then examined in detail for comparisons of satellite imagery results.",
