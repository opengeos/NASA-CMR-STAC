    "description": "INPE's only receiving station for Landsat TM is located in Cuiaba, MT\n      (geographic coordinates approx. 15.5S/56.0W). Data were always\n      acquired in a routine fashion, initially over Brazil only, with\n      extension to the whole range in 1987.  A few gaps exist, some of them\n      several months long, related mostly to station downtimes caused by\n      lightning.\n      \n      The TM tapes recorded at Cuiaba are air shipped to the processing and\n      distribution center in Cachoeira Paulista, SP, where they are\n      kept. The holdings are estimated to be around 70,000 scenes (or\n      500,000 images, counting individually each of the seven spectral\n      bands). About 14,000 scenes have been processed to black-and-white or\n      color photographic originals and can be reproduced as products quicker\n      than unprocessed ones. No copies are kept from delivered digital\n      products.\n      \n      Requests for products and for image search listings are handled\n      directly by the processing center (listed at the Data Center entry),\n      through contacts by mail, phone or fax. No online remote access is\n      available to the moment, although plans exist to implement it,\n      including the International Directory protocols. No firm date is\n      speculated for that, but hopes are that it can be made before 1998.\n      Information about costs, delivery time and available formats can be\n      requested at the same address.",
