    "description": "The VNP43C2 Version 1 data product was decommissioned on July 31, 2025. Users are encouraged to use the [VNP43C2](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43C2.002) and [VJ243C1](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VJ143C2.002) Version 2 data products.\n\nThe NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo Snow-free Model Parameters Daily Global 0.05 Degree Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) Version 1 product (VNP43C2) is derived from the 30 arc second CMG VNP43D Version 1 product suite. VNP43C2 is generated daily from all available snow-free acquisitions over a 16-day moving window emphasizing the ninth day of the retrieval period, which is reflected in the Julian date in the filename. VNP43C2 supplies the weighting parameters associated with the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal BRDF model, which is used to produce the [VNP43C3](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43C3.001) Albedo and [VNP43C4](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43C4.001) Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) products. The highest quality full inversion values are used for the temporal fitting effort and supplemented with lower quality pixels, spatial fitting, and spatial smoothing as needed. The status of each pixel can be found in the ancillary layers. Users are encouraged to assess the quality information before using the BRDF/Albedo data. This 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the equator) CMG product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. \n\nThe VNP43C2 product includes 39 layers containing the three parameters (fiso, fvol, and fgeo) for the VIIRS Day/Night band (DNB), moderate resolution bands M1 through M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11, as well as the shortwave band, visible band, and near-infrared (NIR) broadbands. Along with the parameter data for the 13 bands are four ancillary layers for uncertainty, quality, local solar noon, and percent finer resolution inputs.\n\nKnown Issues\n* The abnormally high activation of the high aerosol flag in the Collection 1 (C1) VNP09 product has impacted downstream products. The VNP43 BRDF/Albedo/NBAR product is affected by reducing the number of otherwise acceptable observations used as input to characterize surface anisotropy. This effect [most obvious over arid bright surfaces), results in a reduced number of high quality full BRDF model inversions. Therefore, users should be aware that bright arid surfaces (normally associated with high quality BRDF/Albedo/NBAR retrievals) are likely to be somewhat represented by lower quality results in C1. VNP09 has been corrected for Collection 2 (C2). Therefore, users should avoid substantive use of C1 VNP43 over arid regions (and wait for C2 products). In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in VNP43[I-M]A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QA provided as part of the VNP43[I-M]A1, 3 and 4 products.\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=VIIRS).",
