    "description": "On December 20, 2003 and again on January 1, 2007, landslides occurred along\nthe coastal bluff that forms the west boundary of Daly City, California sending\ndebris as far as 290 meters downhill and 90 meters into the ocean. This area is\nknown for large landslide events where 150-meter tall coastal bluffs extend\nsouthward along the west boundary of San Francisco and San Mateo Counties (Fig.\n1). The 2003 and 2007 landslide events occurred west of Northridge Drive in\nDaly City and just south of Avalon Canyon, which bisects the bluffs in this\narea (Fig. 2). Residential development, utility lines and roads occupy the land\nimmediately east of this location. As part of a comprehensive project to\ninvestigate the failure mechanisms of coastal bluff landslides in weakly\nlithified sediments along the west coast of the United States, members of the\nU.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology (CMG) Program performed\nreconnaissance mapping of these landslide events including collection of\nhigh-resolution topographic data using CMG's terrestrial LIDAR laser scanning\nsystem.\n\nThe report provides a brief background on each landslide event and presents\ntopographic datasets collected following each event. Downloadable contour data,\nimages, and FGDC-compliant metadata of the surfaces generated from the LIDAR\ndata are also provided. LIDAR data collection and processing techniques used to\ngenerate the datasets are outlined. Geometric and volumetric measurements are\nalso presented along with high-resolution cross-sections through various areas\nof the slide masses and discussion concerning the slides present (2007)\nconfiguration is provided.  \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
