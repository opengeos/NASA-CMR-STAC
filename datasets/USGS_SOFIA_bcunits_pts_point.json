    "description": "Hydrogeologic unit depths at 321 selected points, determined from published cross sections and contour maps, were entered into a point data layer. Generalized land-surface elevations were also entered for each point.\n      \n      Geographic information systems (GIS) have become an important tool in assessing and planning for the protection of natural resources. Most Federal and State natural resource agencies and many County environmental agencies in Florida are currently using GIS to assist in mathematical modeling, resource mapping, and risk assessments. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Broward County Office of Natural Resource Protection (BCONRP), developed a digital spatial data base for Broward County consisting of layers of data that can be used in water-resources investigations. These data layers include manmade features such as municipal boundaries and roads, topographic features, hydrologic features such as canals and lakes, and hydrogeologic features such as aquifer thickness. Computer programs were written for use in developing additional layers of data from existing data bases such as the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) underground storage tank data base. This report describes the digital spatial data base that was developed and the five computer programs that can be used to create additional data layers from existing data files or to document existing layers. Most of the data layers cover Broward County east of the conservation areas. Some data layers cover all of Broward and may include parts of Miami-Dade County.",
