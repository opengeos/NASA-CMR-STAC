    "description": "Oceanographic measurements conducted on voyage 6 of the Aurora Australis of the 2000-2001 season.  These data comprise CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth) and ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) data.\n\nThese data were collected by Mark Rosenberg.\n\nThis metadata record was completed by AADC staff when the data were discovered bundled with acoustics data during a data cleaning exercise.\n\nBasic information about voyage 6:\nThe voyage will complete a range of Marine Science activities off the Mawson Coast, and off the Amery Ice Shelf before calling at Davis to retrieve summer personnel and helicopters prior to returning to Hobart. Science equipment calibration will be undertaken at Mawson. (Marine Science activities were interrupted when the Aurora Australis was required to provide assistance in the Polar Bird's attempt to reach Casey, complete the station resupply and return to open water.)\n\nLeader: Dr Graham Hosie\nDeputy Leader: Mr Andrew McEldowney\n\nSee the readme files in the downloads for more information.",
