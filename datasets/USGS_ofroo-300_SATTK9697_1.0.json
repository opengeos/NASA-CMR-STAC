    "description": "This data set was created to document the original map (McGuire and Fischer,\n1999) produced by the High Plains Water-level Monitoring project and make\navailable the data on this map for use with geographic information systems.\n\nThis digital data set consists of saturated thickness contours for the High\nPlains aquifer in Central United States, 1996-97. The High Plains aquifer\nextends from south of 32 degrees to almost 44 degrees north latitude and from\n96 degrees 30 minutes to 104 degrees west longitude. The aquifer underlies\nabout 174,000 square miles in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico,\nOklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.\n\nThis data set was based on 10,085 water-level measurements, 49 stream\nelevations, (March 1997) and 10,036 water-level elevations from wells (1,370\nfrom 1996 and 8,666 from 1997) and the base of aquifer value for each\nmeasurement location. The saturated thickness at each measurement location was\ndetermined by subtracting the water-level elevation from the base of aquifer at\nthat location.\n\n\n  Introduction --\n\nThe information provided in this introduction is found in U.S. Geological\nSurvey Professional Paper 1400-B (Gutentag and others,1984). This data set\nconsists of saturated thickness contours for the High Plains aquifer in Central\nUnited States, 1996-97 (modified from Weeks and Gutentag, 1981; Cederstrand and\nBecker, 1999). The High Plains aquifer, which underlies about 174,000 square\nmiles in parts of eight states, is the principal water source in one of the\nnation's major agricultural areas. In 1980, about 170,000 wells pumped water\nfrom the aquifer to irrigate about 13 million acres.\n\nThe High Plains aquifer is a regional water-table aquifer consisting mostly of\nnear-surface sand and gravel deposits. In 1980, the maximum saturated thickness\nof the aquifer was about 1,000 feet and averaged about 200 feet. Hydraulic\nconductivity and specific yield of the aquifer depend on sediment types, which\nvary significantly both horizontally and vertically. Hydraulic conductivity\nranged from less than 25 to greater than 300 feet per day and averaged 60 feet\nper day. Specific yields ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent and averaged\nabout 15 percent.\n\nThe High Plains aquifer boundaries were determined by erosional extent of\nassociated geologic units and by hydraulic and physiographic boundaries where\nthe High Plains aquifer extends eastward from the Great Plains physiographic\nprovince (Fenneman, 1931). In most of the area, the erosional extent of the\nhydraulically connected Tertiary and Quaternary deposits were used as the\naquifer boundary. In eastern Nebraska, streams and physiographic boundaries\nwere used as the aquifer boundary.\n\n  Reviews Applied to Data --\n\nThis electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that applies\nto all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers were asked to check the\ntopological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics,\nprojection, and geographic extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets for\nchecking against the source maps to verify the linework and attributes. The\nreviewers checked the metadata files for completeness and accuracy.",
