    "description": "Taken from sections of the report:\n\n1.\tIntroduction\n\nThis report details the survey work carried out on Macquarie Island during November 1997 by LANDINFO staff on behalf of the Australian Antarctic Division's Mapping Program. The main task of the survey team was to acquire aerial photography of the island to enable the production of a new topographic map of the island. Other tasks involved field checking the digital station area map (DSAM) and providing support to the tide gauge maintenance team.\n\nThe following team carried out the survey-mapping work:\nTom Gordon\t\tLANDINFO Surveyor\nRoger Handsworth\tAntarctic Division Engineer\n\nAlthough this report touches on the work carried out by Roger Handsworth and Rupert Summerson, it does not cover the specifics of their work.\n\n\n2.\tProject Brief\n\nThe survey-mapping brief lists the following tasks:\n\n1.\tAerial Photography of the Island and station area.\n2.\tAerial Photography of Judge and Clerk Island to the south and Bishop and Clerk Island to the north of Macquarie Island.\n3.\tSecond order levelling from the tide gauge bench marks to AUS 211\n4.\tUpdating the Digital Station Area map.\n\nThese tasks are listed in order of priority. A copy of the survey brief for Macquarie Island is included in Appendix A.",
