    "description": "Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is an instrument designed to view Earth with cameras pointed in 9 different directions. As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the fate of sunlight in Earth environment, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure. MISR Level 2 Land Surface Product subset for the GoMACCS region V002 contains information on land directional reflectance properties; albedos (spectral and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) integrated); fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR); associated radiation parameters; and terrain-referenced geometric parameters.",
