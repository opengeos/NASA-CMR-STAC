    "description": "This data set includes a variety of station data from two Antarctic icebergs. In 2006, researchers installed specialized weather stations called Automated Meteorological Ice Geophysical Observing Stations (AMIGOS) on two icebergs, A22A and UK211 (nicknamed Amigosberg), near Marambio Station in Antarctica.The AMIGOS stations were outfitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors, cameras, and an electronic thermometer. They collected data from their installation in March 2006 until the icebergs crumbled into the ocean, in 2006 (Amigosberg) and 2007 (A22A). Available data include GPS, temperature and ablation measurements, and photographs of the station base and of flag lines extending out to the edges of the icebergs. Snow pit data from iceberg A22A is also included.\n\nThis data set was collected as part of a National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs Special Grant for Exploratory Research, to explore the possibility of using drfting icebergs to investigate ice shelf evolution caused by climate change. The expedition, nicknamed IceTrek, was conducted jointly with Argentine scientists. The data are available via FTP in ASCII text (.txt) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (.jpg) formats.",
