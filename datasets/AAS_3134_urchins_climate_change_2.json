    "description": "The effect of pH, temperature and sperm concentration on the fertilisation of Sterechinus neumayeri was investigated. Adult Sterechinus neumayeri were collected from Ellis Fjord Narrows between December and January 2011-12 and held in the Ecotox Field Aquarium Module until used. Between 3-4 male and female individuals were spawned using 0.5M KCl and gametes were collected separately before being fertilised in treatment. \n\nThe data set shows the percentage of fertilised and non-fertilised eggs of Sterechinus neumayeri scored at 20h post-fertilisation. Eggs were fertilised in various combinations of pH, temperature and sperm concentration treatments (pH: 8.0 (Control), 7.8 and 7.6; Temperature: 1 degrees C (Control), 3 degrees C and 5 degrees C; Sperm concentration (sperm:egg ratio): 1000:1 (Control), 750:1, 250: 1, 50:1 and 5:1). At 20h post fertilisation, 5 ml aliquot was removed from fertilisation vials and eggs were counted and determined if they were fertilised or not. Seawater parameters of treatments were measured at the start and end of the experiment.\n\nDetailed information of the spreadsheets are as follows:\nSeawater Parameters column headings:\nTemperature - measured in degrees C , shows the temperature treatments used\npH - shows the pH levels used\nSubheading pH - pH level measured for the day using NIST certified buffers\nSubheading MV - pH level measured for the day in millivolts\nSubheading Total pH - total pH level in seawater obtained from MV measurements\nSubheading Temp - temperature of seawater measured for the day\n\n1 deg C column headings:\nExperiment - number of experiments \npH - shows the pH for each treatment\nSperm Concentration - shows the sperm concentration used for each treatment in a egg:sperm ratio\nRep - shows the number of replicates per experiment\nUnfertilised eggs - eggs without visible fertilisation envelope and no cleavage after 20h\nFertilised eggs - eggs with visible fertilisation envelope and/or cleavage after 20h\nFertilised deformed eggs - eggs with visible fertilisation envelope but deformed\nTotal eggs - total eggs scored (whether fertilised or unfertilised)\n% Fertilised - fertilised eggs (deformed and non-deformed)/Total eggs\n\n3 deg C and 5 deg C have the same column headings as 1 deg C.\n\nAAS3134 Abatus sp Growth Experiment Davis 2011-12:\nThe effect of pH and temperature on the growth rate of juvenile Abatus ingens and Abatus shackletoni were investigated. Adult Abatus were collected off Airport Beach in waters 4-5m depth. \n\nData set shows the growth rate of juveniles of Abatus ingens and Abatus shackletoni after a 4-week exposure to various combinations of pH and temperature. Juveniles of each species was removed from maternal pouches and photographed on the oral side before being exposed to combinations of pH (8.0 (Control), 7.8 and 7.6) and temperature (-1 degrees C (Control) and 1 degrees C) levels. They were incubated in treatments for 4 weeks before being removed and rephotographed.  The lengths of 10 spines per juvenile were measured in the pre- and post-experiment photographs using ImageJ and the difference calculated to get a growth rate per juvenile. Seawater parameters of treatments were measured at the beginning of the experiment and subsequently once a day until the end of the experiment.\n\nDetailed information of the spreadsheets are as follows:\n\nA ingens (pre-exp) i.e. juvenile Abatus ingens spine lengths measured before exposure to experimental treatments. Column headings are:\nSpine number and length (mm): Length of each spine (1 - 10) measured per juvenile in mm.\nR1 - R12: Number of juveniles \n\nA ingens (post-exp) i.e. juvenile Abatus ingens spine lengths measured after 4-week exposure to experimental treatments. Column headings are identical to the above.\n\nA shackletoni (pre-exp) i.e. juvenile Abatus shackletoni spine lengths measured before exposure to experimental treatments. Column headings are identical to the above.\n\nA shackletoni (post-exp) i.e. juvenile Abatus shackletoni spine lengths measured after 4-week exposure to experimental treatments. Column headings are identical to the above.\n\n2011-12 Aquarium pH and temp main headings show different treatment parameters.  Column sub-headings are:\nDate - Date of measured seawater parameters\nSalinity - salinity of seawater measured\nPpm - Amount of CO2 gas pumped into water recorded in parts per million\npH - measured pH of seawater using NIST-certified buffers\nMV - pH of seawater recorded in millivolts\nTotal pH - total pH of seawater derived from MV\nTemp - Temperature of seawater measured in degrees C.",
