    "description": "Report on surveys with major tasks: Casey Airfield Survey; Casey Engineering Surveys; Tunnel Terrestrial Photography. Includes tables, diagrams and colour photographic prints.\n\nThe aims of the 1989/90 summer season surveying and mapping program at Casey are as set out in priority order below:\n\n1) Provide surveying support as and when required to the RAAF ground contingent charged with the responsibility of preparing an ice runway for the proposed RAAF C130 Hercules sorties in mid-February 1990.\n\n2) Carry out the following engineering surveys for the Australian Construction Services:\n - Detail survey of proposed helipad site approximately centred on 2040E, 7135N on Casey Master Plan Issue No. 9.\n - Detail survey of proposed helipad site approximately centred on 2254E, 7132N on Casey Master Plan Issue No. 9.\n - Old-New Casey link road movement monitoring survey.\n - Hydrographic survey of the melt water lake at 1900E, 6900N on Casey Master Plan Issue No. 9.\n - Hydrographic survey of the melt water lake at 2000E, 7200N on Casey Master Plan Issue No. 9.\n\n3) Observe horizontal and vertical angles and EDM distances which will enable the strengthening of the geodetic control network in the Bailey and Clark Peninsula areas.\n\n4) Carry out a topographic survey of the Bailey Peninsula area which will enable the preparation of the Casey Management Plan.",
