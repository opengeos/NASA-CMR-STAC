Geophysical Research Letters.\"\n\nThis record, referred to as LD2000, takes the record to end 1999AD. It is based on fine annual isotope data (~10-20 samples/year), here averaged to annual values.\n\nThe dating of the record is based on absolute counting of years in isotope and trace ion data.                  \n\nThis record is a stack in upper portions of five different cores taken near the main DSS drill site on Law Dome, Wilkes Land.                 \n\nDating of DSS/DSS97/DSS99 \"Anne S.

Studies show that the mean timing of the isotope maximum \"at Law Dome is around January 10: eg. See van Ommen and Morgan, 1996 and van Ommen and Morgan, 1997\"\n\nFrom the abstract of the referenced paper:\n\nWe present a reconstruction of Antarctic mean surface temperatures over the past two centuries based on water stable isotope records from high-resolution, precisely dated ice cores.  Both instrumental and reconstructed temperatures indicate large interannual to decadal scale variability, with the dominant pattern being anti-phase anomalies between the main Antarctic continent and the Antarctic Peninsula region.  Comparative analysis of the instrumental Southern Hemisphere (SH) mean temperature record and the reconstruction suggests that at longer timescales, temperatures over the Antarctic continent vary in phase with the SH mean.  Our reconstruction suggests that at longer timescales, temperatures over the Antarctic continent vary in phase with the SH mean.  Our reconstruction suggests that Antarctic temperatures have increased by about 0.2 degrees C since the late nineteenth century.  The variability and the long-term trends are strongly modulated by the SH Annular Mode in the atmospheric circulation.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 757 (ASAC_757).",
