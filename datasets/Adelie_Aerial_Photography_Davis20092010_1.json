    "description": "Aerial photographs were taken at 39 islands in the Vestfold and Rauer Islands regions where occupancy surveys in 2008-09 found breeding Adelie penguin populations. The photographs were taken to estimate the size of breeding Adelie penguin populations.\n\nA total of six flights between 18-23 November 2009 were required to cover the Vestfold and Rauer coastlines. \n\nThe first flight from 0355-0622 UTC on 18th November 2009 covered the southern Vestfolds (see download file).\n\nThe second flight from 0746-0930 UTC on the 18th November 2009 covered Long Peninsula (see download file).\n\nThe third flight from 0945-1132 UTC on the 19th November 2009 mostly covered the northern Vestfolds (Bandits, Mikkelson, Tryne, Wyatt Earp, but also covered Gardner (see download file).\n\nThe fourth flight from 0734-0946 UTC on the 21st November 2009 repeated the previous flight over the northern Vestfolds after preliminary stitching showed that the coverage was not as good as desired. Also, the flight lines for Tryne, Mikkelson and Wyatt Earp were moved to use the north-south flight lines. The opportunity was also taken to repeat a flight over Gardner and perform other tasks (visit 'Woop Woop', the plateau skiway and perform a low level LIDAR scan on the blue ice runway) (see download file).\n\nThe fifth flight from 1306-1556 UTC on the 21st November 2009 covered Hop and Filla Islands in the Rauers (see download file).\n\nThe sixth and final flight from 0828-0951 UTC on the 23rd November 2009 covered the remaining Rauer Islands including Forpost, Torckler, Varyarg, Lunnyy and Kryuchock Islands (see download file).\n\nVertical photos were taken along each flight line from a Squirrel AS350BA helicopter (VH-SES) flying at 80 knots and 750m altitude using a Hasselblad H3DII-50 camera with a 150 mm lens and 1/800th second shutter speed. A 3-second shutter closure interval was achieved using an SDK and intervalometer. The camera auto-focussed effectively at infinity using the software Phocus.",
