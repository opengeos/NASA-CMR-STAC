    "description": "A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the continent coast and islands of Holme Bay, Antarctica with cell size 10 metres was interpolated from input coastline, contour and spot height (point locations with an elevation attribute) data.\n \nThe input data was sourced from the following datasets which are listed with their dataset number:\nFramnes Mountains 1:25000 Topographic GIS Dataset (dataset 55)\nHolme Bay 1:25000 GIS Dataset (dataset 57)\nHolme Bay 1:10000 Gibbney Island Mapping (dataset 90) \nHolme Bay 1:10000 Rookery Islands Mapping (dataset 91)\nHolme Bay 1:10000 Wigg Island Mapping (dataset 96)\nHolme Bay 1:5000 Bechervaise and Welch Islands Mapping (dataset 97)\nMapping around the Framnes Mountains from Spot Imagery at 10 metre pixel resolution (dataset 98)\nRobinson Group, east of Mawson, mapping from Spot satellite imagery at 20 metre pixel resolution (dataset 99)\nFramnes Mountains contours smoothed and edited (dataset 187).\n \nThe spatial coverages and estimated planimetric and vertical accuracies of datasets 57, 90, 91, 96, 97 and 99 are shown in a map linked to this metadata record. These datasets were the source data for the islands and a strip of the continent coast which was the area of interest when the DEM was created. The source data for almost all of the remaining land area, which is inland from a coastal strip, was contours from dataset 187 with an estimated planimetric accuracy of 200 metres and estimated vertical accuracy of 100 metres.\n\nThe interpolation was done using the Topo to Raster tool in ArcGIS.\nThe output DEM was clipped to the extents of the input data.\nThe dataset available from a Related URL in this metadata record includes a text file with the parameters used with the Topo to Raster tool.\nThe DEM is stored in the UTM Zone 41S projection.\nThe horizontal datum is WGS84. The vertical datum is Mean Sea Level.\nThe DEM was initially created as a raster in an ESRI file geodatabase. The geodatabase also includes slope, aspect and hillshade rasters derived from the DEM using ArcGIS. Slope is in degrees. Azimuth 315 degrees and altitude 45 degrees were chosen for the hillshade.\nThe DEM was exported using ArcGIS to two other formats which are included in the dataset available from a Related URL in this metadata record:\n1 A geotiff; and \n2 An ascii file in ESRI's ascii format for rasters.",
