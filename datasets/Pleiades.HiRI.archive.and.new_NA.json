    "description": "The Pleiades twins (1A and 1B) deliver very high-resolution optical data (up to 0.5m resolution Pancromatic and Colour and 2 m Multispectral) and offer a daily revisit capability to any point on the globe. The swath width is of about 20 km (footprint at nadir).  The ortho-products are automatically generated by the Pleiades ground segment, based on SRTM or Reference3D database. The projection available for Pleiades ortho-products is UTM, datum WGS84.  Bands Combinations:  \u2022 Pansharpened colour image at 0.5 m resolution  \u2022 Bundle (0.5m panchromatic image + 2 m multispectral image)  Processing levels:  \u2022 Primary: The Primary product is the processing level closest to the natural image acquired by the sensor. This product restores perfect collection conditions: the sensor is placed in rectilinear geometry, and the image is clear of all radiometric distortion.  \u2022 Standard Ortho: The Ortho product is a georeferenced image in Earth geometry, corrected from acquisition and terrain off-nadir effects.  \u2022 Tailored Ortho: Aside from the Standard Ortho product, when different specifications are needed, a custom orthorectification, with a more precise 3D model provided by the client or acquired for the purpose, can be provided on demand.  The products are available as part of the Airbus provision from Pleiades and Spot missions. Pleiades collection has worldwide coverage: the _$$GeoStore Catalogue$$ https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/en/4871-ordering can be accessed (self registration requested) to discover and check the data readiness.  To complement the traditional and fully customised ordering and download of selected Pl\u00e9iades and SPOT images in a variety of data formats, the user can also request a subscription for the access to _$$OneAtlas Living Library$$ https://oneatlas.airbus.com where the entire OneAtlas optical archive is made available in streaming mode and updated on daily basis.  Search (based on parameter or AOI) and View functionalities are accessible via the _$$OneAtlas Living Library$$ https://oneatlas.airbus.com portal or via _$$API$$ https://api.oneatlas.airbus.com  Three different subscription packages will be at the availability of users: a limitation to 80,000 tiles (corresponding to 1.000km2), a limitation to 160.000 tiles (2.000 km2), and an all-you-can-eat (unlimited) access. The subscriptions will be open for consumption for one entire year.  All details about the data provision, data access conditions and quota assignment procedure are described into the _$$Terms of Applicability$$ https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/documents/20142/37627/SPOT-Pleiades-data-terms-of-applicability.pdf available in Resources section.",
