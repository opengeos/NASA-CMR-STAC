Towing speed of the RMT1+8 were approximately 2 knots. All krill, fish and squid in the catch were sorted, identified to species and counted. The density at each station were determined from the counts per calibrated flow-meter readings attached to the net. Morphometric measures were taken and, for larger taxa.\n\nList of files\nK-Axis Morph combined_for data centre.xlsx: Morphological data for all krill and zooplankton captured in RMT-8 net haul.\nRMT data entry_v1_for data centre.xlsx: Trawl data.\nRMT8 filtered volume_for data centre.xlsx: Filtered volume for each haul.\nMap_all.tif: Map showing all trawl stations.\nMap_RMTR.tif: Map showing only regular trawl stations.\nMap_RMTT.tif: Mapn showing only target trawl stations.\n\n\nK-Axis description\nThis dataset includes biological data from \u201cK-Axis voyage, 2016 and \u201cVoyage 3, 2015\u201d.\n\n[Data from K-Axis voyage, 2016]\nDistribution and abundance of zooplankton, krill and fish were observed on the K-axis transect using deployments of RMT1+8 net.

The spatial variability, particularly along the shelf break, of the prey field for penguins, flying seabirds and marine mammals in East Antarctica.\n2. The small scale variability of prey in key foraging locations near to land-based colonies of penguins and flying seabirds in East Antarctica.\n3. Feasibility and potential of utilising annual station resupply voyages as a cost effective means to undertake monitoring and research to better understand the ecosystem in the region.\nThe survey completed 5 acoustic box surveys including a total of 53 RMT target and routine trawls, 6 demersal trawls, 131 phytoplankton samples from underway sampling, and 214 hourly observations of predators. These activities were successfully supervised remotely.\n-List of files-\nemm-15-22.pdf: Prelminary report of the voyage to CCAMLR WG-EMM\nFigure_V3_all_euphausiids.pdf: Map of Euphausiid abundance distribution.\nFigure_V3_Clione_antarctica.pdf: Map of Clione antarctica abundance distribution.\nFigure_V3_crystal_krill.pdf: Map of Euphausia crystallorophias abundance distribution.\nFigure_V3_frigida.pdf: Map of Euphausia frigida abundance distribution. \nFigure_V3_larval_fish_abundances.pdf: Map of fish larvae abundance distribution. \nFigure_V3_superba.pdf: Map of Antarctic krill abundance distribution. \nFigure_V3_tmacrura.pdf: Map of Thysanoessa macrura abundance distribution.  \nV3_final_for data centre.xlsx: Trawl station data and density data of each taxa caught. \nVoyage 3 Marine Science Program Final.docx: Voyage report.",
