    "description": "Five (out of a possible 7) ice stations were sampled for the Main Biology Site, collected from -63.88S 119.9E off East Antarctic in September to November 2012 during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystems eXperiment (SIPEX) II.  Sampled pack ice floes were several 100 meters to several kilometres apart, and indicated variation in the degrees of physical deformation and biological characteristics.  The sampled sites were selected on each floe due to low snow cover disturbances, were level, and free from surface deformations (limited rafting).\n\nFor the production and carbon allocation dataset, the bottom 2 cm of 3 x 5 - 8 (dependant on level of biomass) cores were collected and combined within a 4 m grid using a 9 cm diameter SIPRE corer.  Biology was isolated from the ice by gently mixing with 0.22 micron filtered sea water collected from the site with a Niskin bottle, and pass through a sieve.  The liquid was then analysed for bacterial and algae productivity.  The corresponding dataset (P:\\Data\\ Copy of SIPEX C14_Ugalde_Raw Data_St 8) describes data (expressed in disintegrations per minute) directly input into an excel file from the scintillation counter measured on board the Aurora Australis.  The additional dataset (P:\\Data\\ SIPEX C14_Chloro_SIPEXII_Updated to Station 8) describes data directly input into an excel file of volume filtered for chlorophyll analysis (expressed in mls) of both the ice and liquid fraction.  \n\nFor the Main Biology dataset, 6 cores were taken from the same site:\nCore 1: temperature profile\nCore 2: nutrients, extracellular polymeric substances\nCore 3 and 4: chlorophyll, pigments (HPLC), bacteria and cell counts\nCore 5: particulate organic carbon/nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon\nEach core was sectioned from the ice-water interface at 0 - 2 cm, 2 - 10 cm, and then the remaining core was quartered.  Core 1 was discarded after the temperature profile was taken.  Core 3 and 4 were slow-melted in at 6 degrees cold room with 0.22 micron filtered sea water collected from the site as above (200 ml per cm ice).  Cores 2 and 5 were slow-melted as above without the addition of filtered sea water.  Additional measurements included 5 replicates of snow thickness and freeboard level.  After melting, samples were taken/filtered for the parameters above within 12 hours of melting.   The corresponding dataset (P:\\Data\\Data Updated to Station 8\\ Main Bio Data Sheet_SIPEX II_Updated to Station 8) describes descriptive and quantitative parameters of the above cores, directly input into a spreadsheet.",
