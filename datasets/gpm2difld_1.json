    "description": "The GPM Ground Validation Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer (2DVD) IFloodS dataset was collected during the GPM Ground Validation Iowa Flood Studies (IFLoodS) field campaign in central-northeastern Iowa in 2013. This campaign aimed to improve satellite precipitation measurements for flood prediction by using ground measurements to improve satellite retrieval algorithms. The Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer (2DVD), developed by Joanneum Research (Graz, Austria), measures raindrop characteristics such as size distribution, shape, and velocity. The 2DVD IFloodS data was collected from 6 sites from April 3, 2013 to June 18, 2013. Officially, the IFloodS campaign ran from May 1 to June 15, 2013 but the 2DVD instruments were installed and calibrated prior to the start, allowing for the wider period of record. The dataset contains daily ASCII files that include measurements for various precipitation parameters.",
