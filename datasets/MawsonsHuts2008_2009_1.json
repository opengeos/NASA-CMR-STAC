    "description": "723 images where loaded into the AAD image library, \"Image Antarctica\" and attached to records in the Antarctic Heritage Register database.  The images documented the condition of the interior and exterior of Mawsons Huts located at Cape Denison including the main hut, the absolute hut, the magnetograph hut and the transit hut during the 2007/2008 season and the 2008/2009 season.  The images were taken in both high resolution jpgs as well as raw files.  The camera used was a Nikon D80.   Also included were images of conserved artefacts as well as details of the conservation treatments uploaded to the Antarctic Heritage Register Database and linked to specific catalogue records.\n\n2011-04-21 - the record was updated to include a file of data from the 2009/2010 season.  Raw data from 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 have also been archived in the AADC servers, and are available to AAD personnel upon request.",
