    "description": "The Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD17A2HGF Version 6.1 Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) product is a cumulative 8-day composite of values with 500 meter (m) pixel size based on the radiation use efficiency concept that can be potentially used as inputs to data models to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation. The data product includes information about GPP and Net Photosynthesis (PSN). The PSN band values are the GPP less the Maintenance Respiration (MR). The data product also contains a PSN Quality Control (QC) layer. The quality layer contains quality information for both the GPP and the PSN.\r\n\r\nThe MOD17A2HGF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MOD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod15a2h.061) is available. Hence, the gap-filled MOD17A2HGF is the improved MOD17, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation  (FPAR/LAI) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MOD17A2HGF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\r\n\r\nStage 3 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) validation has been achieved for MOD17 products.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\r\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\r\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
