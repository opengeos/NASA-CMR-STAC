    "description": "This data set provides measurements from the Amazonian Aerosol Characterization Experiment (AMAZE-08) carried out during the wet season from February 4 to March 21, 2008 in the central Amazon Basin. Aerosol and atmospheric samples and measurements were collected at Tower TT34 located 60 km NNW of downtown Manaus, and at Tower K34, located 1.6 km from the TT34 site. Physical characterization of aerosols included size, mass, and number distributions and light scattering properties. Chemical characterization included mass concentrations of organics, major anions and cations, and trace metals. Aerosol sources were estimated with measurements of black carbon and biogenic particles. Meteorological and atmospheric conditions including relative humidity, temperature, wind speed and direction, rain, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), downward and upward solar irradiance, and condensation nuclei were measured. Atmospheric trace gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were sampled and analyzed.",
