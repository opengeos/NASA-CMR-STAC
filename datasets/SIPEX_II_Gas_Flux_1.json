    "description": "Gas Flux over Sea Ice\n-------------\n\nWe observed amount of gas exchange between sea ice and atmosphere. At the ice station, semi-automated chambers developed in Japan, were used for measurement of air-sea ice CO2 flux. These chambers could be used to examine spatial variability and also temporal variability of gas flux over sea ice. Samples were also taken from the snow and ice in order to measure CH4 and  VOC, however these analyses will be conducted post-voyage. This metadata record will be updated in future to reflect the analysis.\n\nThe chambers are designed to be placed over a snow and sea ice. When the lid is closed, CO2 concentration was measured. The opening and closing functions of the chambers are automated and were set to a 30 minutes interval. CO2 concentration (as voltage) were recorded in the data logger (CR10X, Campbell Scientific Inc.) and downloaded after the experiments. Raw data are contained in the excel files. \n\nDuring the CO2 flux measurement, we collected the snow, sea ice, brine/slush and under-ice water. Snow and sea ice samples were melted after sampling in PVDF film bags (like Tedlar bags in order to avoid gas exchange with ambient air) in 4C temperature and treated for analysis. \nA chemical analysis for carbonate systems and VOC (water), salinity, nutrient, pigment and oxygen isotopic ratio samples will take place in Japan after the voyage for analysis. \nDuring the cruise, to examine ice growth processes, we made sea ice thin-section to classify the ice cores into granular ice, columnar ice or mixed granular and columnar ice (Eicken and Lange, 1989).\n\nThe CO2 data are contained in Excel spreadsheets. These use Japanese column headings.\n\nCalcium Carbonate (CACO3.6H20) as Ikaite in Sea Ice and Snow\n-----------\nAt each listed ice station we collected sea-ice cores using a Kovacs 9cm ice corer. Cores were sectioned into 10-20cm and melted at 4 degrees C, filtered and dried for later analysis of Calcium Carbonate in a home laboratory using an ICP, which produces text file outputs (included).\n\nAlso included is a spreadsheet listing the cores, and the calcium carbonate measurements.",
