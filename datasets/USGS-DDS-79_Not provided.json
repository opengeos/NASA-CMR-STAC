    "description": "Louisiana contains 25 percent of the vegetated wetlands and 40 percent of the\ntidal wetlands in the 48 conterminous States. These critical natural systems\nare being lost. Louisiana leads the Nation in coastal erosion and wetland loss\nas a result of a complex combination of natural processes (e.g. storms,\nsea-level rise, subsidence) and manmade alterations to the Mississippi River\nand the wetlands over the past 200 years. Erosion of several of the barrier\nislands, which lie offshore of the estuaries and wetlands and buffer and\nprotect these important ecosystems from the open marine environment, exceeds 20\nmeters/year. The average rate of shoreline erosion is over 10 meters/year.\nWithin the past 100 years, Louisiana's barrier islands have decreased in area\nby more than 40 percent, and some islands have lost more than 75 percent of\ntheir land area. If these loss rates continue, several of the barriers are\nexpected to erode completely within the next three decades. Their disappearance\nwill contribute to further loss and deterioration of wetlands and back-barrier\nestuaries and increase the risk to infrastructure.\n\nCoastal wetland environments, which include associated bays and estuaries,\nsupport a rich harvest of renewable natural resources with an estimated annual\nvalue of over $1 billion. More than 30 percent of the Nation's fisheries come\nfrom these wetlands, as well as 25 percent of oil and gas coming through the\nwetlands. Louisiana also has the highest rate of wetland loss: 80 percent of\nthe Nation's total loss of wetlands has occurred in this State. The rate of\nwetland loss in the Mississippi River delta plain is estimated to be about 70\nsquare kilometers/year -- the equivalent of a football field every 20 minutes.\nIf these rates continue, an estimated 4,000 square kilometers of wetlands will\nbe lost in the next 50 years. Losses of this magnitude have direct implications\non the Nation's energy supplies, economic security, and environmental\nintegrity.\n\nOver the past two decades, the USGS, working in partnership with other\nscientists in universities and State agencies, has led the research effort to\ndocument barrier erosion and wetland loss and understand the natural and\nmanmade causes responsible. Some products resulting from this research,\nincluded in this DVD, are providing the baseline data and information being\nused for Federal-State wetlands restoration programs underway and being\nplanned. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
