    "description": "The Retrospective Analysis of Antarctic Tracking Data (RAATD) is a Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) project led jointly by the Expert Groups on Birds and Marine Mammals and Antarctic Biodiversity Informatics, and endorsed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The RAATD project team consolidated tracking data for multiple species of Antarctic meso- and top-predators to identify Areas of Ecological Significance.  These datasets constitute the compiled tracking data from a large number of research groups that have worked in the Antarctic since the 1990s.\n\nThis metadata record pertains to the \"filtered\" version of the data files. These files contain position estimates that have been processed using a state-space model in order to estimate locations at regular time intervals. For technical details of the filtering process, consult the data paper. The filtering code can be found in the https://github.com/SCAR/RAATD repository.\n\nThis data set comprises one metadata csv file that describes all deployments, along with data files (3 files for each of 17 species). For each species there is:\n- an RDS file that contains the fitted filter model object and model predictions (this file is RDS format that can be read by the R statistical software package)\n- a PDF file that shows the quality control results for each individual model\n- a CSV file containing the interpolated position estimates\n\nFor details of the file contents and formats, consult the data paper.\n\nThe data are also available in a standardized version (see https://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/SCAR_EGBAMM_RAATD_2018_Standardised) that contain position estimates as provided by the original data collectors (generally, raw Argos or GPS locations, or estimated GLS locations) without state-space filtering.",
