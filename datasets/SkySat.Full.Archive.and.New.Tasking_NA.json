    "description": "The SkySat Level 2B Basic Scene, Level 3B Ortho Scene and Level 3B Consolidated full archive and new tasking products are available as part of Planet imagery offer.  The SkySat Basic Scene product is uncalibrated and in a raw digital number format, not corrected for any geometric distortions inherent in the imaging process. Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) is provided to enable orthorectification by the user.  Basic Scene Product Components and Format  Processing levels\t/\t- Analytic (unorthorectified, radiometrically corrected, multispectral BGRN); - Analytic DN (unorthorectified, multispectral BGRN); - Panchromatic DN (unorthorectified, panchromatic)\t// Product Components and Format\t/\t- Image File (GeoTIFF format); - Metadata File (JSON format); - Rational Polynomial Coefficients (Text File); - UDM File (GeoTIFF format)\t// Image configuration\t/\t- 4-band Analytic DN Image (Blue, Green, Red, NIR); - 1-band Panchromatic DN Image (Pan)\t// Ground Sampling Distance\t/\t3.7 m at nadir (average at reference altitude 475 km)\t// Ground Sampling Distance (nadir)\t/\t- Panchromatic 0.86m and Multispectral 1.0m for SkySat-1&2; - Panchromatic 0.65m and Multispectral 0.8m for SkySat-3 to 13 (0.72 m and 1.0m for data acquired before 30/06/2020)\t// Accuracy\t/\t<50 m RMSE\t//  The SkySat Ortho Scene is sensor- and geometrically-corrected (by using DEMs with a post spacing of between 30 and 90 meters) and is projected to a cartographic map projection; the accuracy of the product will vary from region to region based on available GCPs. Different products are available:  - The SkySat Visual Ortho Scene product is orthorectified, pansharpened, and color-corrected (using a color curve) 3-band RGB Imagery - The SkySat Pansharpened Multispectral Scene product is orthorectified, pansharpened 4-band BGRN Imagery - The SkySat Analytic DN Ortho Scene product is orthorectified, multispectral BGRN, uncalibrated, digital number imagery product. The product has been processed to remove distortions caused by terrain; It eliminates the perspective effect on the ground (not on buildings), restoring the geometry of a vertical shot. Transformation to at-sensor radiance is not included - The SkySat Panchromatic DN Ortho Scene product is orthorectified, panchromatic, uncalibrated, digital number imagery product. It has a finer GSD than the Analytic Product. Transformation to at-sensor radiance is not included. - The SkySat Analytic Ortho Scene are calibrated multispectral imagery products with radiometric corrections applied to correct for any sensor artifacts and transformation to top-of-atmosphere radiance. - The SkySat Consolidated Product are Ortho Collect product created by composing ~60 SkySat Ortho Scenes (Visual, Pansharpened Multispectral, Analytic DN, Panchromatic DN) along an imaging strip into segments.

SkySat collection has worldwide coverage: The Planet Explorer Catalogue can be accessed (Planet registration requested) to discover and check the data readiness.
