    "description": "The past two decades have been a period of unrest for the Long Valley caldera\nof eastern California.  The unrest began in 1978 and continued through late\n1999 and included recurring swarms of moderate earthquakes, as well as\nuplifting of the Resurgent Dome, which has totaled approximately 80 cm.   It is\nbelieved that the seismicity is accompanied by magmatic intrusion beneath both\nthe Resurgent Dome at a depth of about 7 km; 10 km and the South Moat Seismic\nZone (SMSZ) at a depth of about 15 km (Sorey and others, 2003).  Seismic\nsurveys within the caldera's topographic boundary have indicated the seismicity\nbeneath the northwest section of the caldera is associated with fluid injection\ninto narrow conduits and fractures (Stroujkova and Malin, 2000).  Like the\ndominant regional structural trend, these conduits run in a northwest-southeast\ndirection and are only expressed at the surface by a slight topographic relief\nof about 3 m.  Merged aeromagnetic data (Roberts and Jachens, 1999) over the\ncaldera show a magnetic low in the west and a high in the east (Figure 3).  The\nwestern part has been modeled to relate to altered, low-magnetization (about\n2.5 km thick) Bishop Tuff beneath the Resurgent Dome, indicating hydrothermal\nalteration in the west, whereas the high in the east represents the unaltered\nBishop Tuff (Williams and others, 1977).  The ground magnetic survey was\nconducted to locate magnetic lows that might indicate altered zones reflecting\nconduits for hydrothermal fluid flow in the northwest portion of the caldera.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
