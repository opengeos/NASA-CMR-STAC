    "description": "The Diode Laser Hygrometer (DLH) dataset is comprised of water vapor mixing ratio measurements as well as relative humidities (both concerning liquid water and ice) which are derived from the water vapor mixing ratio and ambient static temperature and pressure provided by the TAMMS instrument suite. These measurements were made using two separate DLH instruments installed on the NASA P-3B research aircraft, and the data from these instruments were combined to provide the best combination of accuracy, dynamic range, and data coverage. The two DLH instruments are (1) the zenith-mounted system which utilizes an optical path between the zenith port and the aircraft\u2019s vertical tail, and (2) the short-path system, which utilizes an optical path between two fuselage-mounted fins. This dataset was measured during the 2023 campaign of the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) Earth Venture Suborbital 3 project. IMPACTS was a three-year sequence of winter season deployments conducted to study snowstorms over the U.S. Atlantic Coast (2020-2023). The project aimed to (1) Provide observations critical to understanding the mechanisms of snowband formation, organization, and evolution; (2) Examine how the microphysical characteristics and likely growth mechanisms of snow particles vary across snowbands; and (3) Improve snowfall remote sensing interpretation and modeling to advance prediction capabilities significantly. The DLH data files are available for flights from January 13, 2023, through February 28, 2023, and are in the ASCII format.",
