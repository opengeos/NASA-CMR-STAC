    "description": "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national\nlevel, and for large regional areas.  It is not intended for hazard evaluation\nor other site-specific work, and should not be used for such.  It can be used\nto determine where debris flow processes may be a problem and where additional\ninformation and investigation are warranted.  Although the digital form of the\ndata removes the constraint imposed by the scale of a paper map, the detail and\naccuracy inherent in map scale are also present in the digital data.  The fact\nthat this database was edited at a scale of 1:2,500,000 means that higher\nresolution information is not present in the data.  Plotting at scales larger\nthan 1:2,500,000 will not yield greater real detail, and it may reveal\nfine-scale irregularities below the intended resolution of the database. \nSimilarly, where this database is used in combination with other data of higher\nresolution, the resolution of the combined output will be limited by the lower\nresolution of these data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological\nSurvey in the use of these data.\n\nDebris flows, debris avalanches, mud flows and lahars are fast-moving\nlandslides that occur in a wide variety of environments throughout the world. \nThey are particularly dangerous to life and property because they move quickly,\ndestroy objects in their paths, and can strike with little warning.  The\npurpose of this map is to show where debris flows have occurred in the\nconterminous United States and where these slope movements might be expected in\nthe future.",
