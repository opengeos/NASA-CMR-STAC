    "description": "The data interval is 1995 to 2017, excluding end-points imposed by averaging.\nNCEP/NCAR reanalysis surface pressure data was obtained from  https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.surface.html. Surface pressure residuals are produced consisting of 1-day, 3-day and 5-day averages from which long-term variations are removed by subtracting a pressure average of the remaining, centred, 27-days. These data are in NCEP format  (2.5\u00b0lat. x 2.5\u00b0long.) ASCII csv files.\nSelected daily-averaged solar wind and auroral activity indices, and solar sector boundary crossing dates are derived from data obtained at GSFC/NASA OMNIWeb data at https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov. These data are listed in an EXCEL xlsx file.\nVideos of +/-13 day lags of four superposed epoch analyses of surface pressure responses to selected solar sector boundary crossings. The video are designated NH_MAMJJA_3dpc, SH_JJASON_3dpc_ave-of-3,NH_DJFMAM_6dpc and Equ_Year_8dpc, indicating the region (Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and Equatorial), the interval (acronym of first letter of each month or the entire Year) and the days of IMF By phase consistency (dpc) used to select the solar sector boundary crossing key-dates. The 'ave-of-3' designation indicates the averaging of initial superposed epoch responses across the original lags at -27 days, the key-date and +27 days.",
