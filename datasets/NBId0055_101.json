REMARK:\n      The export files include annotation. however it is not possible to\n      import the files with it. We had to edit in the export file (E00) just\n      before the annotation the TXT command had to be changed in TX8. The\n      annotations are then lost but the file can import without problems.\n      The Africa Closed Moist Tropical Forest dataset is a compilation of\n      national maps into comparable units by the World Conservation and\n      Monitoring Centre (WCMC) in Great-Britain.  The maps were taken for\n      each country for Africa from national maps and legend units were\n      grouped to come upto 13 classes, describing forest types.\n      Contact:  UNEP/GRID-Nairobi, P O Box 30522 Nairobi, Kenya\n      \n      In total 13 classes are compiled\n      10  = Water bodies                    130 = Degradated Rain Forest\n      111 = Mangroves                                 500 = Dry Forest\n      112 = Degradated Mangroves              510 = Pine Forest\n      113 = Inland Swamp Forest\n      114 = Degradated inland Samp Forest   900 = Non Forest\n      121 = Montane Rain  Forest                   999 = No Data\n      122 = Lowland Rain Forest\n      123 = Sun Montande Rian Forest\n      In almost all coverages water bodies are labelled as 0\n      \n      References:\n      WCMC Biodiversity Map Library - Closed Moist Tropical Forests and\n      Managed Areas Data - February 1992 Paivinen and Ron Witt.
