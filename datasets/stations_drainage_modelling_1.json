    "description": "This GIS dataset is the result of modelling of surface water drainage for Australia's year-round stations in Antarctica (Casey, Davis, Mawson) and at Macquarie Island. This was done by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre in 2000 at the request of Dr Martin Riddle and Dr Ian Snape of the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nThe modelling was done using ESRI's ArcInfo workstation. A digital elevation model (DEM) was first created from the the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's topographic data, principally surface contours, and then drainage basins and drainage paths were derived from the DEM. The drainage is predicted surface flow due to changes in elevation and doesn't take account of any other processes. Several DEMs were created for each station at different spatial extents and resolutions.\n\nThe origin of the topographic data was mapping from aerial photography. The aerial photography was flown on 4 January 1994 (Casey), 11, 12 February 1997 (Davis), 7 December 1994 (Macquarie Island) and 18 March 1996 (Mawson).\n\nThe data available for download includes for each station: \n1 the DEMs and the topographic data from which they were created; and\n2 the predicted drainage basins and drainage paths.\nThe data was originally created in ESRI's coverage (vector) and grid (raster) formats. It is provided here in ESRI's file geodatabase format.\nDocumentation is included with the data.\n\nThe modelling was done as an aid to fuel spill contingency planning and the predicted drainage paths were used in the production of a spill risk assessment map for each station to go with the Australian Antarctic Division's fuel spill contingency plan for each station. The maps are available from the SCAR Map Catalogue (see a Related URL) and have catalogue numbers 13702 to 13705.\n\nValidation of the modelling for Casey is described in M.J.Riddle, I.Snape, D.T.Smith and A.Z.Woinarski, 'Development and validation of a GIS-based dispersion model for oil spills in snow covered ground' in Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference Contaminants in Freezing Ground, Hobart 14-18 April 2002 Figures 1 and 2 in this paper are available from the SCAR Map Catalogue and have catalogue numbers 12930 and 12931.",
