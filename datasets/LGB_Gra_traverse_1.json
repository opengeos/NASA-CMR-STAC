    "description": "The Lambert Glacier Basin (LGB) series of five oversnow traverses were conducted from 1989-95. LaCoste and Romberg gravity meters were used to record measurements of the Earth's gravity field approximately every 2 km along the 2014 km main traverse route from LGB00 (68.6543 S, 61.1201 E) near Mawson Station, to LGB72 (69.9209 S, 76.4933 E) near Davis Station. Gravity readings were also obtained at 5 km intervals along a 516 km upper western offset track (50 km parallel upslope from main route) from LGBUW485 (68.6458 S, 60.0272 E) to LGBUW000 (72.6508 S, 55.9275 E).\n\nRaw data were stored as meter readings in field notebooks, transferred manually to spreadsheet files (MS Excel). Processed data were stored in spreadsheet files (MS Excel). The data available at the url below are stored in various formats.\n\nSummary data (2 km spatial resolution) can be obtained from CRC Research Note No.27 'Ice Thicknesses and Surface and Bedrock Elevations from the Lambert Glacier Basin Traverses 1990-95'.\n\nDocuments providing archive details of the logbooks are available for download from the provided URL.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 3 and 2216.\n\nLogbook(s):\n- Gravity Meter Log 89/90\n- LGBT Gravity #2 1992-93\n- Glaciology Gravity Readings LGBT 1990-91",
