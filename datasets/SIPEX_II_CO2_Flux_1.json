    "description": "During the ice stations, measurements of the air CO2, concentration for CO2 flux between sea ice and atmosphere were made with the chamber technique. Air-sea ice CO2 fluxes were measured over the sea ice with semi-automated chambers. Sample air from the chamber is passed through Teflon tubes connected to non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer (Model 800, LICOR Inc., USA) that was connected to a system controller and data logger (Model 10x, Campbell Scientific Inc., USA), that controls the opening/closing of the chambers as well.  During the observation period, the CO2 flux was measured under three different conditions or surface types: (1) a chamber was installed above snow; (2) over the bare ice after removing the snow; (3) slush layer after removing the snow and slush crystals. The CO2 concentration in the chamber was measured every 5 s during experiments lasting 20 minutes for each chamber. A one hour cycle of measurements therefore consist of three 20 minute periods from each chamber (i.e. surface type).  \n\nData available: excel files containing sampling station name for each spreadsheet, dates, sampling time and air CO2 concentration as output voltage from NDIR (to indicated as ppm we need to calculate, but, not yet done this process) in the air and chamber for CO2 flux measurement.\n\nAlso see the record - SIPEX_II_Gas_Flux",
