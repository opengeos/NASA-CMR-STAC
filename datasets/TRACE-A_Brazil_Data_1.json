    "description": "TRACE-A_Brazil_Data is the aircraft and rawinsonde data collected in Brazil during the Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator - Atlantic (TRACE-A) suborbital campaign. Data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is featured in this collection. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe TRACE-A mission was a part of NASA\u2019s Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) \u2013 an assemblage of missions conducted from 1983-2001 with various research goals and objectives.\u202fTRACE-A was conducted in the Atlantic from September 21 to October 24, 1992. TRACE-A had the objective of determining the cause and source of the high concentrations of ozone that accumulated over the Atlantic Ocean between southern Africa and South America from August to October.\u202fNASA partnered with the Brazilian Space Agency (INPE) to accomplish this goal.\u202f \r\n\r\nThe NASA DC-8 aircraft\u202fand\u202fozonesondes\u202fwere\u202futilized during TRACE-A to collect the necessary data. The DC-8 was equipped with 19 instruments. A few\u202finstruments on the DC-8 include the Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL),\u202fthe Laser-Induced Fluorescence, the O3-NO Ethylene/Forward Scattering Spectrometer, the Modified\u202fLicor, and the DACOM IR Laser Spectrometer. The DIAL was responsible for a variety of measurements, which include Nadir IR aerosols, Nadir UV aerosols, Zenith IR aerosols, Zenith VS aerosols, ozone,\u202fand ozone column. The Laser-Induced Fluorescence instrument\u202fcollected measurements on\u202fNxOy\u202fin the atmosphere. Measurements of ozone were recorded by the O3-NO Ethylene/Forward Scattering Spectrometer while the Modified\u202fLicor\u202frecorded CO2. Finally, the DACOM IR Laser Spectrometer gathered an assortment of data points, including CO, O3, N2O, CH4, and CO2.\u202fOzonesondes\u202fplayed a role in data collection for TRACE-A along with the DC-8 aircraft. The sondes were dropped from the DC-8 aircraft in order to gather data on ozone, temperature, and atmospheric pressure.\u202f",
