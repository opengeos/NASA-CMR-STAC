    "description": "The Ugashik-Mount Peulik volcanic center, 550 km southwest of Anchorage on the\nAlaska Peninsula, consists of the late Quaternary 5-km-wide Ugashik caldera and\nthe stratovolcano Mount Peulik built on the north flank of Ugashik. The center\nhas been the site of explosive volcanism including a caldera-forming eruption\nand post-caldera dome-destructive activity. Mount Peulik has been formed\nentirely in Holocene time and erupted in 1814 and 1845. A large lava dome\noccupies the summit crater, which is breached to the west. A smaller dome is\nperched high on the southeast flank of the cone. Pyroclastic-flow deposits form\naprons below both domes. One or more sector-collapse events occurred early in\nthe formation of Mount Peulik volcano resulting in a large area of\ndebris-avalanche deposits on the volcano's northwest flank. \n\nThe Ugashik-Mount Peulik center is a calcalkaline suite of basalt, andesite,\ndacite, and rhyolite, ranging in SiO2 content from 51 to 72 percent. The\nUgashik-Mount Peulik magmas appear to be co-genetic in a broad sense and their\ncompositional variation has probably resulted from a combination of fractional\ncrystallization and magma-mixing. \n\nThe most likely scenario for a future eruption is that one or more of the\nsummit domes on Mount Peulik are destroyed as new magma rises to the surface.\nDebris avalanches and pyroclastic flows may then move down the west and, less\nlikely, east flanks of the volcano for distances of 10 km or more. A new lava\ndome or series of domes would be expected to form either during or within some\nfew years after the explosive disruption of the previous dome. This cycle of\ndome disruption, pyroclastic flow generation, and new dome formation could be\nrepeated several times in a single eruption. \n\nThe volcano poses little direct threat to human population as the area is\nsparsely populated. The most serious hazard is the effect of airborne volcanic\nash on aircraft since Mount Peulik sits astride heavily traveled air routes\nconnecting the U.S. and Europe to Asia. Activity of the type described could\nproduce eruption columns to heights of 15 km and result in significant amounts\nof ash 250-300 km downwind. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
