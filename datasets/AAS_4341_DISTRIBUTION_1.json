    "description": "Distribution data for Stellaria media on Macquarie Island.\n\nThere are 8 files on distribution data for Stellaria media on Macquarie Island. The first 3 files provide the way points of all located Stellaria media plants on Macquarie Island as well as the sizes of a subsample of these plants. The density and distribution of these plants is mapped in file 4. In file 5 more detailed measurements are given from certain of those subsampled sites with regards to plant width, depth, height, age, dominant phenology, and dominance with regards to other vegetation. The final 2 files are summary tables of environmental and vegetation (including Stellaria) characteristics from each of the 8 major population sites at which Stellaria is found on the island. More detailed methods are given in each of the files.\n\nDistribution, % cover and size of S. media will be mapped across MI along with environmental and dispersal factors. Detailed vegetation surveys conducted at 6 infested sites over 3 seasons to determine directional changes in vegetation community structure.\n\nThe AA_NVA excel file records the locations from which samples of seeds and plants were collected from a variety of introduced and native species for use in other trials back in Australia.",
