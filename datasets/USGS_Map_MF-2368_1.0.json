    "description": "The geologic map of the Uinkaret volcanic field area covers part of the\nColorado Plateau and several large tributary canyons that make up the western\npart of Arizona's Grand Canyon.  The map is part of a cooperative U.S.\nGeological Survey and National Park Service project to provide geologic\ninformation for areas within the newly established Grand Canyon/Parashant\nCanyon National Monument. Most of the Grand Canyon and parts of the adjacent\nplateaus have been geologically mapped; this map fills in one of the remaining\nareas where uniform quality geologic mapping was needed.  The geologic\ninformation presented may be useful in future related studies as to land use\nmanagement, range management, and flood control programs for federal and state\nagencies, and private concerns.\n\nThis digital map database is compiled from unpublished data and new mapping by\nthe authors, represents the general distribution of surficial and bedrock\ngeology in the mapped area.  Together with the accompanying pamphlet, it\nprovides current information on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the\narea.  The database dilineate map units that are identified by age and\nlithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution of the\ndatabase to 1:31,680 or smaller.\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (ARC/ INFO\ncoverages) and supporting text and plot files.  In addition, the report\nincludes two sets of plot files (Post Script and PDF format) that will generate\nmap sheets and pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field\nStudies Report.  These files are described in the explanatory pamphlets\n(uink.eps, uink.pdf, or uink.txt).  The base layer used in the preparation of\nthe geologic map plot files was derived from four Digital Raster Graphic\nversions of standard USGS 7.5' quadrangles.  These raster images where\nconverted to Grid format in ARC/INFO, trimmed and seamed together, then\nconverted to a GeoTIFF image.  The resultant TIFF image was combined with\ngeologic data to produce the final map image in Illustrator 9.0.",
