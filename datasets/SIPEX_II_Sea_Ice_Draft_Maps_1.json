    "description": "These data were collected on the SIPEX II voyage of the Aurora Australis in 2012.\n\nThese data are floe-scale maps of Antarctic sea ice draft (m).  These were collected using a multibeam instrument attached to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  This AUV was the WHOI 'SeaBED-class' vehicle named 'Jaguar'. Details on the deployment and processing of this data can be found in Williams, Maksym and Wilkinson et al., 2014 (Nature Geoscience).\n\nData are provided for SIPEX-II stations 3, 4 and 6.\n\nStation 3: October 3 2012, located at 121.03E 64.95S\n\nStation 4: October 9 2012, located at 120.87E 65.13S\n\nStation 6: October 12 2012, located at 120.02E 65.25S\n\nData are provided on grids with 50cm horizontal spatial resolution. For each station, the mean and variance of the sea ice draft, along with the number of observations in each grid cell, are provided. Data are provided in ESRI ASCII grid format and comma-separated (CSV) text files. CSV files do not include grid cells with no observations.",
