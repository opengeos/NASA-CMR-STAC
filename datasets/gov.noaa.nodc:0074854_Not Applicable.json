    "description": "Chemical, profile and laboratory analysis oceanographic data were collected aboard the Ferrel in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-07-03 to 2010-07-07 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include Semivolatile Organic Compounds, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) and Volatile Organic Compounds. The instruments used to collect these data included bottle along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. This data set also contains products created for use in real time analysis and decision support. These products may include charts, graphs, maps, plots, and GIS formatted data files. The analytical chemistry data are provisional and provide results of onshore laboratory analysis of water and sediment samples. Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers.
