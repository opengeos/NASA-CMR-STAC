    "description": "The National Geochemical Data Base (NGDB)\n\"http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/projects/geochem_database/index.html\"\n\nThe NGDB consists of 1) the original RASS and PLUTO data from the USGS labs,\nwhich are now stored in a common format under the ORACLE relational database\nmanagement system; 2) the NURE data, which have been reformatted and reside\ncurrently on the following web site: http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr-97-0492/\nwhere downloads may be made on the basis of 1:250000-scale quadrangles; and 3)\nthe newly generated data (approximately 1996 - present) which reside on the\nLaboratory Information Management System. The enhancements to the NGDB will\nenable both USGS scientists and external customers to more easily extract\nimmediately useable data on a national, regional, and local scale to help\nestablish a baseline for the abundance and spatial distribution of chemical\nelements in the Earth's surficial materials.\n\nThe National Geochemical Data Base (NGDB) contains more than two million data\nrecords for samples of stream sediment, soil, rock, water, panned concentrate,\ndrill core, and vegetation collected during geochemical surveys conducted by\nthe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other Federal Government agencies.  The\ndata are from samples collected in the United States and foreign countries.\n\nThe NGDB includes data from the U.S. Geological Survey's National Mineral\nResource Assessment Program (NMRAP) and the Department of Energy's National\nUranium Resourse Evaluation Hydrogeo-chemical and Stream Sediment\nReconnaissance (NURE HSSR) program.  Data from the Rock Analysis Storage System\n(RASS) are also included.\n\nSamples collected by USGS scientists were subjected to a variety of analytical\ntechniques depending on the research project being conducted.  Some of the\nmethods applied were emission spectroscopy, neutron activation, x-ray emission,\natomic adsorption, and several wet chemical and other instrumental methods.\nFurther, most of the samples from which the NGDB was generated are held in\narchival storage and are available for further analysis.\n\nThis data set includes the location name, latitude/longitude, rock name,\nformation, geologic age, material class, sample source, sample type, and\nchemical analyses information on rocks, soils, sediments, minerals, and plants.\n\nThe part of the NGDB containing the NURE HSSR data for the conterminous United\nStates has been published as a CD-ROM as USGS Digital Data Series DDS-18-A and\n18-B.  Data may be searched and retrieved by sample type, 1 X 2 quadrangle\nname, latitude and longitude, element concentration range, or any combination\nof these criteria.  CD-ROMs are being developed for additional parts of the\nNGDB.\n\nOther data in the NGDB are available by writing the Data Center Contact above.",
