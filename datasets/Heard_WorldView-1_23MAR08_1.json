    "description": "The WorldView-1 image of Heard Island (23 March 2008) that was purchased by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) and the University of Tasmania (UTAS) in June 2008 has to be geometrically corrected to match the Quickbird and IKONOS imagery in the Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) satellite image catalogue. In addition, the WorldView-1 imagery contains two separate image strips that cover the whole island. These strips were acquired at slightly different times from different angles during the satellite overpass. The discrepancy in acquisition angle has resulted in a geometric offset between the two image strips. These two image strips were orthorectified with a 10 m RADARSAT DEM (2002). The orthorectified images were then merged into a single image mosaic for the whole island.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 2939 (ASAC_2939).",
