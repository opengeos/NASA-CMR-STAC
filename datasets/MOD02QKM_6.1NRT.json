    "description": "The 250 meter MODIS Level 1B Near Real Time (NRT) data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 2 discrete bands located in the 0.62 to 0.88 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W / (m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data. \nChannel locations for the MODIS 250 meter data are as follows:\n\nBand   Center Wavelength (um)    Primary Use\n----   ----------------------    -----------\n1        0.620  - 0.670        Land/Cloud Boundaries\n\n2        0.841  - 0.876        Land/Cloud Boundaries\n\nSeparate L1B products are available for the five 500m resolution channels (MOD02HKM) and the twenty-nine 1km resolution channels (MOD021KM). For the 500m product, there are actually seven channels available since the data from the two 250 m channels have been aggregated to 500m resolution.  Similarly, for the 1km product, all 36 MODIS channels are available since the data from the two 250m and five 500m channels have been aggregated into equivalent 1km\npixel values.\n\nSpatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 250 m, degrading to 1.2 km in the along-scan direction and 0.5 km in the along-track direction for pixels located at the scan extremes. A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 250 m granule will contain a scene built from 203 scans sampled 5416 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 granules will be produced per day. Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 40 along-track spatial elements for the 250 m channels, the scene will be composed of (5416 x 8120) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing scan overlap beyond about 17 degrees scan angle.\n\nThe Shortname for this product is MOD02QKM and is stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical\nData Format (HDF-EOS). A typical file size will be approximately 140 MB and the total daily volume is around 22GB.\n\nEnvironmental information derived from MODIS L1B measurements will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout the world.\n\nSee the MODIS Characterization Support Team webpage for more C6 product information at:\n\nhttp://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/l1b/product-information\n\n\nor visit Science Team homepage at: \nhttp://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/",
