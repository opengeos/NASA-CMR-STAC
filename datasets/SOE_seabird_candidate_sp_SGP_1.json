    "description": "This indicator is no longer maintained, and is considered OBSOLETE.\n\nINDICATOR DEFINITION\nThe number of  breeding pairs of Southern Giant Petrels at Heard Island, the McDonald Islands, and in colonies near Casey, Davis and Mawson stations.\n\nTYPE OF INDICATOR\nThere are three types of indicators used in this report:\n1.   Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system;\n2.   Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system;\n3.   Determine RESPONSES to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.\n\nThis indicator is one of: CONDITION\n\nRATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION\nThe breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels is related to resource availability (nesting space and food), behavioural mechanisms (immigration/emigration and breeding effort/success) in addition to climate change and human impacts (including fisheries and human disturbance). Monitoring breeding populations and interpretation of the data provides information on changes in the Antarctic and Subantarctic ecosystems.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial scale: Colonies near Australian Stations -\nFrazier Islands, Casey (lat 66 degrees 16' 54.5' S, long 110 degrees 31' 39.4' E)\nHawker Island, Davis (lat 68 degrees 34' 35.8' S, long 77 degrees 58' 02.6' E)\nGiganteus Island, Mawson (lat 67 degrees 36' 09.7' S, long 62 degrees 52' 25.7' E)\n\nHeard Island - (lat 53 degrees 06' 00.0' S, long 73 degrees 31' 59.9' E)\n\nMcDonald Islands - (lat 53 degrees 02' 26.2' S, long 72 degrees 36' 00.0' E)\n\nFrequency: Breeding Southern Giant Petrels are easily disturbed. Colonies are visited every 3-5 years to minimise disturbance to breeding birds.\n\nMeasurement technique: All colonies are visited and breeding birds are counted from outside the colonies by two personnel performing replicate counts. All breeding individuals in a colony are counted. No birds are disturbed off their nests.\n\nConsiderations regarding disturbance associated with census visits are also incorporated into monitoring strategies. The lack of annual census data does not reduce the value of these long-term monitoring programmes.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\nAll Southern Giant Petrel breeding populations in the AAT and at HIMI decreased following their discovery.  Southern Giant Petrels breeding on Indian Ocean islands are highly sensitive to human disturbance. Access to breeding colonies is restricted, as are the types of activities permitted. Disturbance from researchers has been implicated in the observed decreases in these populations (Woehler et al. 2001, Woehler et al. in press). Analyses of the long term AAT data suggest that the breeding populations at Hawker Is and at the Frazier Is have recovered following the restrictions on access and activities permitted on breeding islands.\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS",
