    "description": "CER_BDS_J01-FM6_Edition1-CV is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Bidirectional Scans (BDS) Joint Polar Satellite System 1 (NOAA-20) Flight Model 6 (FM6) Edition1-CV data product. Data collection for this product is ongoing. \r\n\r\nNote: Edition 1-CV data are only for instrument validation and not suited for science publications.\r\n\r\nCER_BDS_J01-FM6_Edition1-CV is CERES geolocated and calibrated Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) filtered radiances and other instrument data. Edition1-CV data are for instrument validation and are not suited for science publications. Each CERES BDS data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft. The BDS includes samples of regular and short Earth scan elevation profiles in fixed and rotating azimuth modes (including space, internal calibration, and solar calibration views). The BDS contains Level-0 raw (unconverted) science and instrument data and the geolocated converted science and instrument data. The BDS has additional data not found in the Level-0 input file, including converted satellite position and velocity data, celestial data converted digital status data, and parameters used in the radiance count conversion equations. \r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions follow the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, the protoflight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
