    "description": "This dataset contains in-situ atmospheric ozone mixing ratios observed during SIPEX 2. \n\nOzone Monitor\nInstrument Description: Commercial dual cell ultraviolet ozone analyser: Thermoelectron Model 49C. Calibration to a traceable ozone standard prior to and after the voyage. Ozone loss in inlet and on filter quantified and negligible.\n\n\nInstrument Setup:\nThis instrument is sampling from its own Teflon sample air inlet secured to the front port side railing of the Monkey Deck. Air samples are drawn through a 30m  quarter inch Teflon tube then through an inline particle filter before being entering the instrument located in the Met-Lab. Each week, a 30 minute instrument zero is performed by inserting an inline scrubber which catalyses ozone destruction. In the current position, wind from the aft of the ship will blow ship exhaust over the inlet, causing fluctuating low ozone values. Use the 2D anemometer and mercury measurements made on \"Ned Kelly\" in the mercury data file to filter for wind direction versus heading, also the mercury data itself is indicative of sampling ship emissions.\n\nThe files included are in csv format. Files are named as per the date they were created. Data continued to log to the most recent file until data collection stopped. There is a \"Long\" and a \"Normal\" file for each set. The \"Long\" contains instrument parameters logged every hour, and the \"Normal\" contains minute average ozone concentrations.",
