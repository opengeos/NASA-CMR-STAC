    "description": "This data set includes abundance and distribution of sea ice and water column micro-invertebrates.\nData was collected form 8 stations over the course of the SIPEX 2 voyage. The data for this project consists of 2 separate collection regimes:\n\n1. Ice cores - a number of ice were taken at stations 1-6, using a 15cm corer, they were sectioned and dissolved in filtered seawater before being fixed in formalin. At Station 6 sufficient biomass was present in the bottom 10cm of some cores to allow microscopic separation of copepod species, which were then frozen for stable isotope analysis (SIA).\n\n2. Lazer optical plankton counter (LOPC) was deployed at stations 2 to 7 either from ice holes (IH) or from the trawl Deck (TD) to depths of 60m or 100m. These deployments were made throughout the day where possible and were accompanied by a 100um plankton net . Each deployment consisted of 2 drops for both the LOPC and the net. Collected plankton were filtered onto 50um mesh and backwashed into vials before being fixed in 5% formalin.\n\nAll LOPC files .bin will require LOPC program manufactured by ODIM Rolls Royce Nova Scotia.\nThese files are read to format .dat which maybe opened as a .txt file",
