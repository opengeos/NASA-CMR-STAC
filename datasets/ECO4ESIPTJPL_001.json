    "description": "The ECO4ESIPTJPL Version 1 data product was decomissioned on September 30, 2025. Users are encouraged to use the [ECO_L4T_ESI]( https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L4T_ESI.002) and [ECO_L4G_ESI]( https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L4G_ESI.002) Version 2 data products.\n\nThe ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52 degrees N and 52 degrees S latitudes. \n\nThe ECO4ESIPTJPL Version 1 data product provides Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) data generated according to the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm described in the ECOSTRESS Level 4 (ESI_PT-JPL) Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). The ESI product is derived from the ratio of the Level 3 actual evapotranspiration (ET) to potential ET (PET) calculated as part of the algorithm. The ESI is an indicator of potential drought and plant water stress emphasizing areas of sub-optimal plant productivity.\n\nThe ECO4ESIPTJPL Version 1 data product contains variables of ESI and PET.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\n* Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\n* Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",
