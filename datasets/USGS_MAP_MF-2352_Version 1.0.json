    "description": "The purpose of this mapping was to determine the bedrock geology that would\ncontrol or impact ground-water flow from the Espanola basin into the Santo\nDomingo basin.  As it is a multi-purpose geologic map, it is suitable as the\ngeologic layer for any variety of interdisciplinary investigations\nincorporating geology as a theme.\n\nThis digital geologic map summarizes all available geologic information for the\nTetilla Peak quadrangle located immediately southwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico. \nThe geologic map consists of new polygon (geologic map units) and line\n(contact, fault, fold axis, dike, flow contact, hachure) data, as well as point\ndata (locations for structural measurements, geochemical and geochronologic\ndata, geophysical soundings, and water wells).  The map database has been\ngenerated at 1:24,000 scale, and provides significant new geologic information\nfor an area of the southern Cerros del Rio volcanic field, which sits astride\nthe boundary of the Espanola and Santo Domingo basins of the Rio Grande rift.\n\nThe quadrangle includes the west part of the village of La Cienega along its\neastern border and includes the southeasternmost part of the Cochiti Pueblo\nreservation along its northwest side.  The central part of the quadrangle\nconsists of Santa Fe National Forest and Bureau of Land Management lands, and\nparts of several Spanish-era land grants.\n\nInterstate 25 cuts through the southern half of the quadrangle between Santa Fe\nand Santo Domingo Pueblo.  Canada de Santa Fe, a major river tributary to the\nRio Grande, cuts through the quadrangle, but there is no dirt or paved road\nalong the canyon bottom.\n\nA small abandoned uranium mine (the La Bajada mine) is found in the bottom of\nthe Canada de Santa Fe about 3 km east of the La Bajada fault zone; it has been\npartially reclaimed.\n\nThe surface geology of the Tetilla Peak quadrangle consists predominantly of a\nthin (1-2 m generally, locally as thick as 10? m) layer of windblown surficial\ndeposits that has been reworked colluvially.  Locally, landslide, fluvial, and\npediment deposits are also important.  These colluvial deposits mantle the\nprincipal bedrocks units, which are (from most to least common): (1) basalts,\nbasanites, andesite, and trachyte of the Pliocene (2.7-2.2 Ma) Cerros del Rio\nvolcanic field; (2) unconsolidated deposits of the Santa Fe Group, mainly along\nthe western border, in the hanging wall of the La Bajada fault zone, but\nlocally extending 2-3 km east under the Cerros del Rio volcanic field; (3)\nolder Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Abiquiu?, Espinaso, and Galisteo\nFormations); (4) intrusive rocks of the Cerrillos intrusive center that are\nroughly coeval with the Espinaso volcanic rocks; and (5) Mesozoic sedimentary\nrocks ranging in age from the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation to the Upper\nCretaceous Mancos Shale.\n\nGEOSPATIAL DATAFILES AND OTHER FILES INCLUDED IN THIS DATA SET:\n  Map political location: Santa Fe and Sandoval Counties, New Mexico\n  Compilation scale: 1:24,000\n  Geology mapped: 1996-1998\n  >tepk_geol:           geologic units, faults, dikes, volcanic flow boundaries\n  >tepk_struct:         bearing and attitude measurements of structural\nfeatures\n  >tepk_bed:            attitude measurements of geologic units\n  >tepk_chem:           geochemical and geochronologic data by sample\n  >tepk_amt:            audio-magneto-telluric (AMT) geophysical sample data\n  >tepk_wells:          water well locations\n  >tepk_marker:         cartographic decorations (bar and ball symbol, etc.)\n  >color524.shd:        ArcInfo shadeset used to color geology polygons\n  >geoscamp1.mrk:       ArcInfo markerset used to plot geologic symbols\n  >geoscamp1.lin:       ArcInfo lineset used to plot geologic line symbols\n  >tepk_base.tif,.tfw:  1:24,000-scale topographic base",
