    "description": "This study, completed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Bureau of\nTopographic and Geologic Survey (T&GS), provides estimates of ground-water\nrecharge for watersheds throughout Pennsylvania computed by use of two\nautomated streamflow-hydrograph-analysis methods--PART and RORA. The PART\ncomputer program uses a hydrograph-separation technique to divide the\nstreamflow hydrograph into components of direct runoff and base flow. Base flow\ncan be a useful approximation of recharge if losses and interbasin transfers of\nground water are minimal. The RORA computer program uses a recession-curve\ndisplacement technique to estimate ground-water recharge from each storm period\nindicated on the streamflow hydrograph.\n\nRecharge estimates were made using streamflow records collected during\n1885-2001 from 197 active and inactive streamflow-gaging stations in\nPennsylvania where streamflow is relatively unaffected by regulation. Estimates\nof mean-annual recharge in Pennsylvania computed by the use of PART ranged from\n5.8 to 26.6 inches; estimates from RORA ranged from 7.7 to 29.3 inches.\nEstimates from the RORA program were about 2 inches greater than those derived\nfrom the PART program.\n\nMean-monthly recharge was computed from the RORA program and was reported as a\npercentage of mean-annual recharge. On the basis of this analysis, the major\nground-water recharge period in Pennsylvania typically is November through May;\nthe greatest monthly recharge typically occurs in March.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
