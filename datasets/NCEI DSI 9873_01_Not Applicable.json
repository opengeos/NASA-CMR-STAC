    "description": "The dataset DSI 9873 is a subset of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network data monitored by NOAA ESRL Global Radiation (G-Rad) group in Boulder, Colorado. The \"STAR\" network is a name that Ells (Ellsworth Dutton, deceased) came up with for the NOAA Global Monitoring Division (formerly CMDL) radiation measurements at GMD's baseline sites at Barrow, Mauna Loa, American Samoa, Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO tower), South Pole, and other sites at Kwajalein, Bermuda, and Trinidad Head (CA). Before STAR, they were just referred to as \"Baseline sites\". As the NCEI archive only contains a subset (The \"STAR\" stations continue to operate, so their data set does extend beyond 2008), users are encouraged to contact the ESRL Global Monitoring Division for the most up-to-date information. \n            \n\nPer MACI team: \nThe dataset DSI 9873 is a subset of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network data monitored by NOAA ESRL Global Radiation (G-Rad) group in Boulder, Colorado. Dave Longenecker is the data manager in Boulder and he provides the data to the global network (see online resource URL). In a phone conversation with Mara Sprain, 22 Aug 2016, Dave related that he didn't know we had this small subset. He had no direction to provide us with additional data. \n\nThis dataset needs a submission agreement (if it's to be maintained) or it should be a candidate for removal. It's duplicated both in Boulder (FTP) and Germany (FTP and PANGAEA). \n\nFrom John Augustine email, 19 Aug 2016: The \"STAR\" network is a name that Ells (Ellsworth Dutton, deceased) came up with for the NOAA Global Monitoring Division (formerly CMDL) radiation measurements at GMD's baseline sites at Barrow, Mauna Loa, American Samoa, Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO tower), South Pole, and other sites at Kwajalein, Bermuda, and Trinidad Head (CA). Before STAR, they were just referred to as \"Baseline sites\". When NCDC found out about these measurements (circa 2008), they requested that their data be submitted there. I wrote a program for Ells to do that and several years of data were submitted. I am not sure how up-to-date those submissions are because I don't do them. If you want metadata on the Baseline sites, you will have to contact Dave Longenecker (david.u.longenecker@noaa.gov). He has been the data manager for them for many years. Bermuda and Kwajalein have been supported by NASA, but they cut those funds this year. I am not sure whether they will continue. Bermuda has not operated for about three years because of communication problems and other issues. It will be brought back up soon. The \"STAR\" stations continue to operate, so their data set does extend beyond 2008. \n\nData are also (?) held in Colorado archive.",
