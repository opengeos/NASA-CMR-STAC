    "description": "Atmospheric and oceanic methane in the marine boundary layer was monitored from July 17 to August 12 by the GC 7890A along the cruise track of R/V Araon from Nome(Alaska) to Nome carrying out a series of expeditions in the Chuckchi Sea. The air inlet to the instrument was located at 29 m asl and the sea water inlet was located at 7m depth. CH4 was measured every 40 minutes.\nAs atmospheric methane is one of the major green house gases, it is important to understand the degree of influence of it. Although oceanic source doesn't contribute highly, it is required to monitor air-sea flux continuously because the area of the Ocean is large and the flux changes easily according to the chemical and biological conditions.",
