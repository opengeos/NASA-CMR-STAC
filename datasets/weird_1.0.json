    "description": "The lateral transport of heat above abrupt (sub-)metre-scale steps in land surface temperature influences the local surface energy balance. We present a novel experimental method to investigate the stratification and dynamics of the near-surface atmospheric layer over a heterogeneous land surface. Using a high resolution thermal infrared camera pointing at synthetic screens, a 30Hz sequence of frames is recorded. The screens are deployed upright and horizontally aligned with the prevailing wind direction. The screen\u2019s surface temperature serves as a proxy for the local air temperature. We developed a method to estimate near-surface two-dimensional wind fields at centimetre resolution from tracking the air temperature pattern on the screens. Wind field estimations are validated with near-surface three-dimensional short-path ultrasonic data. To demonstrate the capabilities of the screen method, we present results from a comprehensive field campaign at an alpine research site during patchy snow cover conditions. The measurements reveal an extremely heterogeneous near-surface atmospheric layer. Vertical profiles of horizontal and vertical wind speed reflect multiple layers of different static stability within 2m above the surface. A dynamic, thin stable internal boundary layer (SIBL) develops above the leading edge of snow patches protecting the snow surface from warmer air above. During pronounced gusts the warm air from aloft entrains into the SIBL and reaches down to the snow surface adding energy to the snow pack. Measured vertical turbulent sensible heat fluxes are shown to be consistent with air temperature and wind speed profiles obtained using the screen method and confirm its capabilities to investigate complex in situ near-surface heat exchange processes.  Here you find the data and the documented code used to create the plots in the publication.",
