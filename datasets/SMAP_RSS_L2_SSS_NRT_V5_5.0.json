    "description": "The SMAP-SSS level 2C near real-time (NRT) V5.0 dataset produced by the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and sponsored by the NASA Ocean Salinity Science Team, is a validated product that provides near real-time orbital/swath data on sea surface salinity (SSS) derived from the NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. SMAP, launched on January 31, 2015, was initially designed to measure and map Earth's soil moisture and freeze/thaw state to better understand terrestrial water, carbon and energy cycles, and has been adapted to measure ocean SSS and ocean wind speed using its passive microwave instrument.  The SMAP instrument is in a near polar orbiting,  sun synchronous orbit with a nominal 8 day repeat cycle. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe dataset includes derived SMAP SSS, SSS uncertainty using the NRT SMAP Salinity Retrieval Algorithm, top of atmosphere brightness temperature (TB), wind speed and direction data for extreme winds, and other all necessary ancillary data and the results of all intermediate steps. Data from July 28, 2022 to present, is available with a latency of about 6 hours. The observations are global, provided on a 0.25&deg; fixed Earth grid with an approximate spatial resolution of 70 km. The major differences to the standard version 5.0 data products are: (1) the NRT version of the L1B SMAP antenna temperatures is used, (2) the latest 6-hourly 0.25&deg; wind speed and direction are used for the ancillary wind speed and direction input, (3) the CMC SST from 2 days earlier is used for the ancillary SST input, (4) the sea-ice mask of the 3-day aggregate RSS AMSR-2 Air-Sea Essential Climate Variables (AS-ECV) data set from 2-days earlier is used for the sea-ice flag, (5) no correction for sea-ice contamination is performed, it is recommended to use only SMAP data that are classified to be within sea-ice zone 0 for open ocean scene and no sea-ice contamination.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis RSS SMAP-SSS V5.0 NRT dataset holds tremendous potential for scientific research and various applications. Given the SMAP satellite's near-polar orbit and sun-synchronous nature with its 1000km swath, it achieves global coverage in approximately three days, enabling researchers to monitor and model global oceanic and climatic phenomena with unprecedented detail and timeliness. These data can inform and enhance understanding of global weather patterns, the Earth\u2019s hydrological cycle, ocean circulation, and climate change.",
