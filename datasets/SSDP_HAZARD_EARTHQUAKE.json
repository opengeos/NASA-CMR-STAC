    "description": "Detailed maps bring a greater resolution to the number and locations of active\nfaults. Preparing maps at a higher resolution requires extensive field study,\nand with a GIS, information, such as tract and parcel data, utility corridors,\nand flood hazard zones, can be incorporated to help decision makers in locating\nremediation facilities.\n\nAfter the Sylmar earthquake in 1972, building codes were strengthened, and the\nAlquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act was passed. Its purpose is to mitigate\nthe hazard of fault rupture by prohibiting the location of most human occupancy\nstructures across the traces of active faults. Earthquake fault zones are\nregulatory zones that encompass surface traces of active faults with a\npotential for future surface fault rupture. The zones are generally established\nabout 500 feet on either side of the surface trace of active faults.\n\nActive faults and strips of state-mandated zoning along faults (Alquist-Priolo\nzones) riddle the Salton Sea Basin. The primary fault, the San Andreas, steps\nfrom the northeast side of the Salton Sea across the southern end, along a\nseries of poorly understood faults, to the Brawley and Imperial fault systems.\nThis stepover region has not had a historic ground-rupturing earthquake.\nAlquist-Priolo zones could not be defined because the faults are not\nwell-located. Faults parallel to, and splaying from, the San Andreas are also\ncapable of major earthquakes.\n\nInitial plans for remediation facilities take into account the generalized\ninformation (at 1:750,000 scale) on active faults, and the fault maps do not\nprovide information on strong ground shaking. The shaking can damage facilities\nthat lie far from an earthquake epicenter and far from active faults.\nInformation on near-surface materials is required to estimate the\nground-shaking hazards.",
