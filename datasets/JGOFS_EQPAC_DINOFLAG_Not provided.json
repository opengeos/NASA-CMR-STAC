    "description": "The Equatorial Pacific Process Study (EQPAC) was conducted along 140 deg W\n            longitude during 1992.\n            \n            Four cruises took place: February 3 - March 9, March 19 - April 15,\n            August 5 - September 18, and September 24 - October 21.  A fifth benthic\n            cruise and sediment trap legs were added.  During the first cruise\n            (TT007), 15 stations were occupied along 140 deg W longitude from\n            12 deg N latitude to 12 deg S latitude.  During the second cruise\n            (TT008), data were collected at 8 stations along 140 deg W longitude\n            from 9 deg S latitude to 9 deg N latitude.  During the third cruise\n            (TT011), data were collected at 15 stations along 140 deg W from 12 deg N\n            latitude to 12 deg S latitude.  During the fourth cruise (TT012), data were\n            collected at 5 stations along 140 deg W longitude from 17 deg S\n            latitude to the equator.\n            \n            Samples were collected at each station in a vertical profile using\n            the CTD rosette bottle sampler for the measurement of heterotrophic\n            dinoflagellates.  Microzooplankton were enumerated by inverted\n            microscopy of settled samples.  Abundance (cells/ml), biovolume (cubic\n            micrometers), and biomass (ugC/l) were measured.\n            \n            The data is public domain and can be retrieved on-line at\n            \"http://usjgofs.whoi.edu/jg/dir/jgofs/\"\n            \n            [The information in this summary was derived from the JGOFS\n            World Wide Web pages.]",
