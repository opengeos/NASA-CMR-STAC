    "description": "Rapid toxicity tests (Kefford et al. 2005) were used to test the sensitivity of a wide range of intertidal and shallow sub-tidal marine invertebrates collected off the northern end of Macquarie Island. The tests were 10 days long, with a water change at 4 days. Resulted in the data set are non-modelled LCx (concentrations lethal to x% of the test populations) values for Copper (Cu) 10 days of exposure.\n\nKefford, B.J., Palmer, C.G., Jooste, S., Warne, M.St.J. and Nugegoda, D. (2005). What is it meant by '95% of species'? An argument for the inclusion of rapid tolerance testing. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment 11: 1025-1046.\n\nInvertebrates collected from a range of coastal waters off the northern end of Macquarie Island .\n\nThe columns in the spreadsheet are as follows:\n\nLowest ID = the lowest identification the taxa is ID to (can be species, genus, family, etc.)\n\nGroup = major taxonomic group the taxa comes from\n\nLetter = a convent identifier to split the taxa       \n\nLC50 discpt = a string description of the10 day LC50 (lethal concentration for 50% of the test population)\n\nLC50 point estimate = a point estimate of the 10 day LC50 (lethal concentration for 50% of the test population)\n\nCencor = indicates if the LC50 is right censored (that is greater than the value indicated in the point estimate)           \n\nCase = a number to identify the record\n\nProject Public Summary:\n\nDespite pollution concerns in Antarctic and southern oceans, there is little ecotoxicological data and none from the sub-Antarctic. Ecological risk assessments and water quality guidelines should use local data, especially in the polar environment as organisms may respond differently to pollutants. The sub-Antarctic is, however, between Antarctica and the temperate zone and in the absence of local data, it maybe appropriate to use temperate data. This project will assess how the sensitivity to metals of marine invertebrates varies latitudinally and in which region of the Antarctic, if at all, it is appropriate to use temperate data.",
