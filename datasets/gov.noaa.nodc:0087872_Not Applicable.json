    "description": "The Deepwater Horizon Joint Analysis Group (JAG) for Surface and Sub-Surface Oceanography, Oil and Dispersant Data was a working group with membership from federal agencies, BP, and academia that was formed to analyze sub-surface oceanographic data being derived from the on-going coordinated sampling efforts by private, federal and academic scientists as part of the spill response. The goal of the JAG was to provide comprehensive characterization of the Gulf of Mexico sub-surface conditions as well as the fate and transport of dispersed petroleum as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. JAG findings were published in a series of reports for the Unified Area Command as well as the public. This accession contains Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon and Volatile Organic Analysis data from laboratory analysis, as well as in situ Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter and dissolved oxygen data. This dataset was compiled as part of the final JAG summary report, and referred to in Appendix 3 of that report, NOAA Technical Report NOS OR&R 27 (2012).",
