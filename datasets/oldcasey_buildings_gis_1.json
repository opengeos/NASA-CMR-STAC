    "description": "Work commenced on the original Casey station in 1964 and it was fully operational by February 1969. Casey was a novel concept in Antarctic stations at the time with living and sleeping quarters, and some work buildings, in a straight line and connected on the windward side by an aerodynamic corrugated iron tunnel. All were elevated on scaffolding pipe to allow the flow-through of the violent winds common in the region. The tunnel station was decommissioned, demolished and all parts returned to Australia by 1993.\n\nThe final data in this dataset is a polygon shapefile representing the buildings at the original (now called 'old') Casey station. Included also are: (i) other files used to create the final shapefile; and (ii) a Readme file with explanation about the procedure used.",
