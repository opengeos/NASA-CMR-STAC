    "description": "The OMPS-NPP L2 LP Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile swath l2 3slit (AER) product contains the retrieved aerosol extinction coefficients measured by the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Limb-Profiler (LP) sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite. The AER product measures stratospheric aerosol abundance and evolution at 6 wavelengths (510, 600, 675, 745, 869 and 997 nm) to complement the OMPS LP measurements of stratospheric and mesospheric profile ozone. This product replaces the previous single wavelength 675 nm (AER675) product. Each granule contains data from the daylight portion of each orbit measured for a full day. Spatial coverage is global (-90 to 90 degrees latitude), and there are about 14.5 orbits per day each measuring three limb profiles spaced approximately 250 km in the cross-track direction. The profiles are measured from the ground up to about 80 km with a vertical resolution of the retrieved profiles of approximately 1.8 km. The files are written using the Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 or HDF5. The /ProfileFields/RetrievedExtCoeff dataset is produced via a neural network trained on LP-L2-AER data for NRT processing.  ",
