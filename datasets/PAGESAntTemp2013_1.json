    "description": "As part of a larger reconstruction of global temperatures over the last 2000 years, work was done to bring together all the Antarctic temperature datasets into one combined dataset.\n\nTaken from the PAGES website:\nAntarctica and the Southern Ocean play a key role in the global climate system (e.g. Mayewski et al., 2009; Convey et al., 2009). The processes that occur at these high southern latitudes play a pivotal role in global atmospheric and oceanic circulation, oceanic uptake of heat and carbon, and planetary energy balance, through the ice-albedo feedback.\n\nThe ability to detect and attribute climate change in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean is dependent upon climate observations; however, this region is the most observation-sparse and record-length-limited part of the globe. There are few systematic observations extending back before the mid-20th century and good coverage is only available since the satellite era (i.e. the last 3-4 decades).\n\nIn this context, key questions of the PAGES 2k Network underscore an acute need for good high resolution palaeoclimate data extending out to 2000 years before the present, but also with good coverage through the instrumental period so as to permit proxy calibration. Obtaining well-resolved ice cores over large parts of Antarctica is a challenge, but one that is becoming more tractable with the use of new technology. Antarctica2k seeks to integrate such records with other available proxies in order to address the goals of the 2k Network.",
