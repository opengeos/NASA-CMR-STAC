    "description": "The MOD14.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nMODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products are primarily derived from MODIS 4- and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are employed to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline.\r\n\r\nMOD14 is level-2 swath data provided daily at 1-kilometer resolution. The Science Data Sets in this product include fire-mask, algorithm quality, radiative power, and numerous layers describing fire pixel attributes.\r\n\r\nThe Terra MODIS instrument acquires data twice daily (10:30 AM and PM), as does the Aqua MODIS (1:30 PM and AM). These four daily MODIS fire observations serve to advance global monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS Thermal Anomalies & Fire products have attained Validation Stage 3, which was completed using active fire reference data that were derived from ASTER and Landsat-5 TM (30 m resolution) data sources.\r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nChanged calculation of fire radiative power (FRP) to produce more useful output; users no longer need to multiply FRP by pixel area\r\nChanged long name of SDS \"FP_power\"\r\nChanged calculation of detection confidence to more accurately identify questionable fire pixels\r\nMore: Collection 5 Change Summary for MODIS Active Fire Algorithm and Products (http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/QA_WWW/forPage/C005_Change_Fire.pdf)\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: February 24, 2000 -  March 30, 2017\r\nArea: ~2330 x 1300 kilometers \r\nDimensions: 2030 x 1354 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~0.4 MB \r\nResolution: 1 kilometer \r\nProjection: None (swath data) \r\nFire Mask Data Type: 8-bit unsigned integer \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 23 \r\nDimensions: 3 ( row x column x Fire Pixel Table)",
