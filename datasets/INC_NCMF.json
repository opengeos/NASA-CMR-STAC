    "description": "The Nature Characterization Map of Flanders is a collection of all available\ngeographic information at the regional level that is considered relevant for\nnature conservation. The purpose of the map was to compile a database, making\nit possible to objectively grade the ecological value of a specific location.\nThis grading system is based on three modules?the actual natural value, the\nabiotic system features, and the legal framework.\n\nThe actual natural value is primarily derived from the Biological Valuation\nmap, a vegetation and land use map covering the entire Flemish region.\nAdditional information comes from maps of (international) important wildlife\nareas, biotope rareness, level of habitat fragmentation, and the location of\nvaluable rivers and streams.\n\nThe abiotic system features are used as a tool to integrate larger areas and to\nlocate potentially valuable systems. The main information source is the soil\nmap, from which several other features are derived.\n\nThe third module, the legal and policy framework, is important for establishing\nthe feasibility of any proposed conservation projects. It includes information\non the legal designation of land use and national and international protection\nstatus.\n\nIn the long term, the aim is to compile the information from the three modules\ninto a single score, based on multicriteria analysis. The system should also\nallow for expansion and updating when new information becomes available. The\nmap's primary use is to supply policy makers, planners, and nature conservation\norganizations at the regional and local levels with extensive and objective\ninformation.",
