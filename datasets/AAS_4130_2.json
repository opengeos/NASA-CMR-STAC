    "description": "A long-standing problem is why the mid-latitude ionosphere (eg over Australia) is sometimes enhanced during space weather storms, and sometimes depleted. While storms occur mainly at high latitudes, their effects propagate equatorward via upper atmosphere's winds, waves, electric fields, and chemical composition but we do not understand why the relative importance of these varies from storm to storm. By measuring these various drivers over Antarctica and their subsequent impacts at mid-latitude during many storms over a 5-year period we will determine the statistical importance of each driver.\n\nThe spectrometers are currently based at Mawson and Davis. This record details thermospheric and mesospheric winds, temperatures, and emission intensities from the Fabry Perot Spectrometer.\n\nThis project has replaced ASAC project 2699 - the data from which are held in the metadata record \"Fabry-Perot_Spectrometer\".",
