    "description": "The purpose of this map is to show the differences between the extents of late\nPleistocene pluvial lakes and older, larger lakes caused by much higher\neffective moisture during past glacial-pluvial episodes. \n\nDuring the Pliocene to middle Pleistocene, pluvial lakes in the western Great\nBasin repeatedly rose to levels much higher than those of the well-documented\nlate Pleistocene pluvial lakes, and some presently isolated basins were\nconnected. Sedimentologic, geomorphic, and chronologic evidence at sites shown\non the map indicates that Lakes Lahontan and Columbus-Rennie were as much as 70\nm higher in the early-middle Pleistocene than during their late Pleistocene\nhigh stands. Lake Lahontan at its 1400-m shoreline level would submerge\npresent-day Reno, Carson City, and Battle Mountain, and would flood other\nnow-dry basins. To the east, Lakes Jonathan (new name), Diamond, Newark, and\nHubbs also reached high stands during the early-middle(?) Pleistocene that were\n25-40 m above their late Pleistocene shorelines; at these very high levels, the\nlakes became temporarily or permanently tributary to the Humboldt River and\nhence to Lake Lahontan. Such a temporary connection could have permitted fish\nto migrate from the Humboldt River southward into the presently isolated Newark\nValley and from Lake Lahontan into Fairview Valley. The timing of drainage\nintegration also provides suggested maximum ages for fish to populate the\nbasins of Lake Diamond and Lake Jonathan. Reconstructing and dating these lake\nlevels also has important implications for paleoclimate, tectonics, and\ndrainage evolution in the western Great Basin. For example, shorelines in\nseveral basins form a stair-step sequence downward with time from the highest\nlevels, thought to have formed at about 650 ka, to the lowest, formed during\nthe late Pleistocene. This descending sequence indicates progressive drying of\npluvial periods, possibly caused by uplift of the Sierra Nevada and other\nwestern ranges relative to the western Great Basin. However, these effects\ncannot account for the extremely high lake levels during the early middle\nPleistocene; rather, these high levels were probably due to a combination of\nincreased effective moisture and changes in the size of the Lahontan drainage\nbasin.",
