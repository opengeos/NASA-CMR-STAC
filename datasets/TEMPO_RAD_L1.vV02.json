    "description": "Level 1 radiance files provide radiance information at TEMPO\u2019s native spatial resolution, ~10 km^2 at the center of the Field of Regard (FOR), for individual granules. Each granule covers the entire North-South TEMPO FOR but only a portion of the East-West FOR. The files are provided in netCDF4 format, and contain information on radiometrically and wavelength calibrated and geolocated radiances for the UV and visible bands, corresponding noise, parameterized wavelength grid, geolocation, viewing geometry, quality flags and other ancillary information. The product is produced using the L0-1b processor which includes multiple steps: (1) Image processing to produce radiometrically calibrated radiance, (2) Additional wavelength calibration to improve wavelength registration, (3) Image Navigation and Registration (INR) using GOES-R data, and (4) post INR processing geolocation tagging and polarization correction. Please refer to the ATBD for details.\r\nThese data are beta. Beta maturity is defined as: the product is minimally validated but may still contain significant errors; it is based on product quick looks using the initial calibration parameters.\r\nBecause the products at this stage have minimal validation, users should refrain from making conclusive public statements regarding science and applications of the data products until a product is designated at the provisional validation status.\r\nThe TEMPO Level 1 ATBD is still being finalized. For access to Version 1.0 ATBD, please contact the ASDC at larc-dl-asdc-tempo@mail.nasa.gov.",
