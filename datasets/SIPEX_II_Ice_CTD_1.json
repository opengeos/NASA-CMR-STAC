    "description": "CTD casts were taken through holes in the ice floe at various locations during ice stations 3, 4, 6 and 7. Two Seabird 37M microcats were used. One microcat did not log time, whereas the other did. An Idronaut Ocean Seven 304 CTD (manufactured in Italy) was used during ice stations 7 and 8.\n\nCSV files are provided. A single file represents a set of casts at a single location. The files are organised in columns as:\nColumn 1: Temperature (C)\nColumn 2: Conductivity\nColumn 3: Pressure\nColumn 4: Salinity (ppt)\nColumn 5: Date (DD MMM YYYY), UTC\nColumn 6: Time (HH:MM:SS), UTC\n\nFor the Seabird 37M (2006 model) belonging to Dr Hutchings, time on the microcat is set to UTC, to the second.\nFor the AWI Seabird 37M (1999 model), time is not output. This microcat dribbled data to a laptop at 1Hz.\n\nIce Station 3: \nA microcat was placed at about 7m below the surface (5m below the ice) at Ridge site 1. Salinity sensor was iced up on this cast\n\nIce Station 4: \nCast 1: 100m cast through the ROV hole on Oct 6th 10:30 UTC. \nCast 2: 10m cast at the trace gas site, on Oct 8th 06 UTC. \nCast 3: 100m cast at the trace gas site, on Oct 8th 09:30 UTC.\n\nIce Station 6:\nCast 1: 100m at ridge site 1 , on Oct 13th 03 UTC. \nCast 2: 10m casts at Trace Gas site, on Oct 13th 04:30 UTC. F\nNote that salinity sensor was iced on 10m cast at trace gas site.\nCast 3: Deployment at 7m depth at ridge site 1, on Oct 13th 06UTC.\nCast 4: 100m cast at ridge site 1, on Oct 14th 23 UTC. \nNote that microcat stopped recording at about 65m in downcast.\n\nIce Station 7:\n- CTD casts with Seabird 37M microcat:\nCast 1: 100m cast, Transducer Hole A, at active ridge. 20th Oct 03:00Z. Power failed 60m into downcast.\nCast 2: 30m cast, Y-axis 50m core hole. 20th Oct 05:15Z\nCast 3: 40m cast followed by 100m cast. Y-axis 100m ADCP hole. 21st Oct 00:00Z. Power failed at 60m.\nCast 4: 15m casts. Y-axis 50m core hole. 21st Oct 05:15Z\nCast 5: ROV Hole. With Polly's pinger. 21 Oct 09:30Z. Power failure at 86m.\n- CTD casts with Gerhard Dieckman's Seabird microcat. Note this microcat does not output time, but dribbles 1Hz data.\nCast 6: Transponder Hole near new ridge. 23rd Oct 06:30Z. \nCast 7: Trace Metal / Bio site. 23rd Oct 07:30Z. \nCast 8: At ROV Hole\n\nIce Station 8:\nSynoptic (3 hourly) CTD casts\nRoster of CTD casts is contained in file 'CTD_time.xls'.
