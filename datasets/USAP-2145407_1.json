    "description": "Antarctic ice streams and outlet glaciers are the primary conduits of glacier ice from the interior of the continent to the ocean, where net ice loss contributes to global sea-level rise. Any process that speeds up or slows down the rate at which these ice streams move can appreciably impact the balance between ice gain and loss in Antarctica, with important implications for coastal communities worldwide. Processes that can lead to ice-stream acceleration are frequently studied, whereas ice-stream stagnation, which most recently occurred in Antarctica about 180 years ago, is studied less often. This project will leverage two decades of existing data from field experiments in Antarctica on a decelerating ice stream. The team will re-process these datasets from five different NSF-funded projects using modern geophysical methods to build long time-series of observations that provide insight into ice-sheet processes and test hypotheses about how stagnation occurs. In parallel, the team will leverage existing experiential field data to develop unique immersive learning modules to provide an accessible mechanism for the next generation of STEM students to experience Antarctic field work. Finally, this CAREER award will support a new pathway for a diverse cohort of researchers in the glaciology community by establishing and hosting annual regional Colorado Glaciology meetings that will connect community college educators and local glaciology researchers to exchange ideas, develop collaborations, and advertise opportunities.     Over a quarter century of previous work has proposed that Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, may stagnate by the mid-21st century, yet the processes that drive stagnation are still largely considered only in coarse, idealized terms. This project will leverage 13 years of continuous Global Positioning System data and 29 years of seismic data to interrogate ice-stream deceleration and stagnation processes. The multi-decadal datasets will indicate the evolution of stick-slip motion of the ice stream, long-term and spatially varying ice-thickening trends, and subglacial lake activity.  These data will be used to explore how coupled ice-stream/subglacial-hydrology dynamics may lead to ultimate stagnation. In addition to the scientific investigations, the team will ensure the long-term archiving of unprocessed legacy field data to support the ability of future generations to apply novel techniques to past datasets. This project will include research experiences for students from the Colorado community college system and will develop three educational modules using low-cost immersive technologies to inspire and promote ice-sheet science to students from 6th grade to graduate school as well as the public.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
