    "description": "This dataset contains geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset was captured at 1:10,000 and comprises of\n- glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations (point data)\n- the locations of raised beach sequences (polygon data)\n- the Holocene Marine Incursion limits. The marine incursion limits are represented by a height in meters (line data). The attribute table contains an attribute hlmi_height_m field.\n- glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations (point data)\n- of a Jokulhlaup event near Casey Station winter 1985 (ie outburst of water from beneath a cold ice-cap terminus on Law Dome) (point data). This event was observed and documented by Dr Ian D Goodwin. The attribute tables contains additional information. From the results of oxygen-isotope and solute analysis, the water was found to have originated as basal melt water. It contained a high total solute load with a dominant enrichment in alkalis, indicating that it has been squeezed through subglacial sediments for an extensive time period. This event represents one of the first known recordings in Antarctica and provides further insight into determining the subglacial hydrological regime beneath the Law Dome ice cap.\n- contour boundaries defining the marine incursion limits (line data). Interpretation of these boundaries can be carried out using sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes. They represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles within the Windmill Islands.\n- the locations of Windmill Islands lichenometric observations. Attribute data contains the maximum thallus size recorded at each location. It includes observations of lichens growing on nunataks for which the time of deglaciation is known and observations of lichens growing on supraglacial moraine ridges for which the time of formation is not known. This dataset thus provides the basis for a relative chronology of moraine development based on the assumption that the growth of the lichen thallus has been constant since the time of deglaciation.\n- lakes and ponds identified from documented field observations  (polygon and point data). Each lake/pond is represented as a polygon with a central point label which is linked to a separate an attribute table containing additional information. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles within the Windmill Islands.\n- Point data assigned to topographic profiles and transects and to the respective samples represented along these profiles. The point and line data contains attribute tables profile.aat and profile.pat assigned with the following items respectively :\nprofile_name, descript, descript1, descript2, descript3 and profile.pat :\nprofile_name, site, s_elev, br_elev, s_elev_source, br_elev_source, s_elev_qual, br_elev_qual. \n\nData does not conform to Geoscience Australia's Data Dictionary as the data is too detailed.\n\nGlacial sediments were collected and identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers, as well as topographic and surface features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by then AUSLIG in the 1993-94 field season. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles within the Windmill Islands.",
