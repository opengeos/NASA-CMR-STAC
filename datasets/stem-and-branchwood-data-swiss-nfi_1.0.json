    "description": "In the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) the volume of the stem and of large (\u2265 7cm in diameter) and small branches is estimated based on allometric functions. These functions were developed based on data collected within the permanent plot network of the Experimental Forest Management (EFM) sites at WSL (David I. Forrester; Hubert Schmid; Jens Nitzsche (2021). The Experimental Forest Management network. EnviDat. doi: 10.16904/envidat.213). The data  were converted to digital format in two separate steps in the mid-1970s for stemwood and the mid-1980s for branchwood.  The dataset on stemwood volume contains 38\u2019864 single tree data for the mean crosswise diameter at two meter sections along the stem plus an additional measurements at 1.3 m (i.e. DBH) where the diameter is greater than or equal to 7 cm (i.e. threshold of merchantable wood) and the lengths of the stem from the base to the threshold of merchantable wood and to the tree top. The measurements were collected on 768 EFM sites in the period 1888 to 1974. The dataset on branchwood is based on a subset of the stemwood data and contains in the raw format information on 14'712 single trees. It includes aggregated data from the stemwood dataset, i.e. the DBH, the stem-diameter at 7 m from the base, and the tree height from the base to the top, as well as the measured volume of large and small branches.  In 2022, the metadata of both datasets were checked, values were examined for plausibility and duplicated entries. Duplicates were removed as far as possible and the branchwood volume data were appended to the stemwood dataset to obtain a final, single file with matching single tree data. Following this evaluation the final dataset consisted of a total of 38\u2019841 trees including 14\u2019038 trees with measured branchwood data.",
