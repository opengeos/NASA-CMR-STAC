    "description": "The dispersal of algae by wind within Antarctica was investigated by testing four techniques for detecting viable algae in the air: 1) High through put 'jet' spore samples, 2) Clinical monitors, 3) Liquid impinger and 4) Tauber traps. Air was sampled from Scott Base, the Ross Ice Shelf (at a site east of a line between Cape Crozier on Ross Island and White Island) and Victoria Valley (west end of Lake Vida). Snow drifts were also sampled from the Ross Ice Shelf as they were considered to be natural long term particle traps. Samples were also taken of visible algal growths on soils, in streams and in ponds in the vicinity of Scott Base. Soil samples were removed from the driest surfaces where no vegetation was visible. Cultures established from these were used to indicate the composition of the local algal flora for comparison with airborne species. In Victoria Valley, an extensive survey of the aquatic and terrestrial algae in the valley and along some of the ridges and upper valley sides was completed for knowledge of local sources of airborne propagules for comparison with the air samples.",
