    "description": "CER_CRS_Aqua-FM3-MODIS_Edition2c is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Clouds and Radiative Swath (CRS) Aqua-Flight Model 3 (FM3) Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Edition2C data product, which was collected using the CERES-FM3 instrument on the Aqua platform. Data collection for this product is complete. Note that more recent (2006) CRS Ed2C fields for untuned SW (upper left for all-sky globe and lower right for clear-sky ocean) show a bit more bias than does an average of the earlier (2002-2005) Clouds and Radiative Swath (CRS) Ed2B. CRS Ed2C (Ed2B) biases are evaluated concerning SSF Ed2C (Ed2B) observations, and those Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) observations do not include recent \"Rev1\" adjustments to observations.\r\n\r\nThe CRS product contains one hour of instantaneous Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for a single scanner instrument. The CRS has all of the CERES SSF product data. For each CERES footprint on the SSF, the CRS also contains vertical flux profiles evaluated at four levels in the atmosphere: the surface, 500-, 70-, and 1-hPa. The CRS fluxes and cloud parameters are adjusted for consistency with a radiative transfer model, and adjusted fluxes are evaluated at the four atmospheric levels for both clear-sky and total-sky.\r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions follow the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument, the proto flight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
