    "description": "Maps Provide an overview of coal production from the Appalachian basin, by\ncounty.\n\nThis report on Appalachian basin coal production consists of four maps and\nassociated graphs and tables, with links to the basic data that were used to\nconstruct the maps.  Plate 1 shows the time (year) of maximum coal production,\nby county.  For illustration purposes, the years of maximum production are\ngrouped into decadal units.  Plate 2 shows the amount of coal produced (tons)\nduring the year of maximum coal production for each county.  Plate 3\nillustrates the cumulative coal production (tons) for each county since about\nthe beginning of the 20th century.  Plate 4 shows 1996 annual production by\ncounty. During the current (third) cycle of coal production in the Appalachian\nbasin, only seven major coal-producing counties (those with more than 500\nmillion tons cumulative production), including Greene County, Pa.; Boone,\nKanawha, Logan, Mingo, and Monongalia Counties, W. Va.; and Pike County, KY.,\nexhibit a general increase in coal production.  Other major coal-producing\ncounties have either declined to a small percentage of their maximum production\nor are annually maintaining a moderate level of production.  In general, the\nareas with current high coal production have large blocks of coal that are\nsuitable for mining underground with highly efficient longwall methods, or are\noccupied by very large scale, relatively low cost surface mining operations. \nThe estimated cumulative production for combined bituminous and anthracite coal\nis about 100 billion tons or less for the Appalachian basin.  In general, it is\nanticipated that the remaining resources will be progressively of lower\nquality, will cost more to mine, and will become economical only as new\ntechnologies for extraction, beneficiation, and consumption are developed, and\nthen only if prices for coal increase.",
