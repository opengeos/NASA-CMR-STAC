    "description": "The ECO1BRAD Version 1 data product was decommissioned on May 21, 2025. Users are encouraged to use the [ECO_L1CT_RAD](https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1CT_RAD.002) Version 2 and [ECO_L1CG_RAD](https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1CG_RAD.002) Version 2 data products.\n\nThe ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52 degrees N and 52 degrees S latitudes. .\n\nThe ECO1BRAD Version 1 data product provides at-sensor calibrated radiance values retrieved for five thermal infrared (TIR) bands operating between 8 and 12.5 microns. Additionally, the digital numbers (DN) for the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band are provided. The TIR bands are spatially co-registered to produce a variable spatial resolution between 70 meters (m) to 90 m at the edge of the swath. The ECO1BRAD data product is provided as swath data and does not contain geolocation information. The corresponding [ECO1BGEO](https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO1BGEO.001) data product is required to georeference the ECO1BRAD data product. The geographic coverage of acquisitions for the ECO1BRAD Version 1 data product extends to areas outside of those indicated on the coverage map. However, corresponding higher-level products over these areas are not available at this time.\n\nThe ECO1BRAD Version 1 data product contains variables of radiance values for the five TIR bands, DN values for the SWIR band, associated data quality indicators, and ancillary data.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Cannot perform spatial query on ECO1BRAD in NASA Earthdata Search: ECO1BRAD does not contain spatial attributes, so granules cannot be searched by geographic location. Users should search for ECO1BRAD data products by orbit number instead.\n* Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\n* Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\n* Missing scan data/striping features: During testing, an instrument artifact was encountered in ECOSTRESS bands 1 and 5, resulting in missing values. A machine learning algorithm has been applied to interpolate missing values. For more information on the missing scan filling techniques and outcomes, see Section 3.3.2 of the User Guide.\n* Scan overlap: An overlap between ECOSTRESS scans results in a clear line overlap and repeating data. Additional information is available in Section 3.2 of the User Guide.\n* Scan flipping: Improvements to the visualization of the data to compensate for instrument orientation are discussed in Section 3.4 of the User Guide.\n* Cold bias: ECOSTRESS Level-1 Radiance data shows high correlation with in-situ ground measurements (R2 = 0.99 in all bands). Currently, ECOSTRESS has a cold bias of approximately 0.7 Kelvin (K), which will be corrected through calibration in future data releases.\n* Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",
