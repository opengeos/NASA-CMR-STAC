    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52\u00b0 N and 52\u00b0 S latitudes. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found in figure 2 on the ECOSTRESS website.\r\n\r\nThe ECO1BRAD Version 1 data product provides at-sensor calibrated radiance values retrieved for five thermal infrared (TIR) bands operating between 8 and 12.5 \u00b5m. Additionally, the digital numbers (DN) for the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band are provided. The TIR bands are spatially co-registered to produce a variable spatial resolution between 70 meters (m) to 90 m at the edge of the swath. The ECO1BRAD data product is provided as swath data and does not contain geolocation information. The corresponding ECO1BGEO data product is required to georeference the ECO1BRAD data product. The geographic coverage of acquisitions for the ECO1BRAD Version 1 data product extends to areas outside of those indicated on the coverage map. However, corresponding higher-level products over these areas are not available at this time.\r\n\r\nThe ECO1BRAD Version 1 data product contains layers of radiance values for the five TIR bands, DN values for the SWIR band, associated data quality indicators, and ancillary data.",
