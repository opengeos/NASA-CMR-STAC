    "description": "The transects and plots were originally installed in 1987 and 1988 on the grassy balds of the Roan Mountain Massif [Round Bald, Engine Gap, Jane Bald, Grassy Ridge, Big Yellow Mountain (also known as Yellow Mountain), Little Hump Mountain, Bradley Gap, and Hump Mountain (also known as Big Hump Mountain)]. Data collected from the transects were to characterize baseline conditions against which the effects of future vegetation management actions could be evaluated. This legacy data set represents (1) an analysis of data collected from transects and plots that were originally installed in 1987 and 1988 and revisited in 1992, and (2) information on the entry of the 1987, 1988, 1992, 1993, and 1994 data electronically in 1994. Analyses were conducted to document the pre-management conditions of the vegetation on the grassy balds complex of Roan Mountain, and the changes in vegetation on Round Bald and Jane Bald in response to the hand-mowing between 1987-1988 and 1992. This was the second time that a vegetation composition analysis was conducted using the 1987 and 1988 baseline data. Information pertaining to this dataset primarily comes from one report that describes the analyses, electronic files and hardcopies of the raw data, and interviews with the originators of the transect and plot data. This metadata record documents geospatial legacy data to the extent practicable, as required by Executive Order 12906, \"Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and Access: The National Spatial Data Infrastructure,\" dated April 11, 1994. Details may be missing, but given the resources available, the information provided herein is as concise as possible at this point in time.",
