    "description": "Ion-exchange columns were used in the WTP (water treatment plant) for water treatment during the clean-up of the Thala Valley tip - data collected during the operation were used as a field trial to investigate the effectiveness of Amberlite IRC748 for the application. Spreadsheets 1,2 contain sample ID descriptions for samples collected from the WTP, spreadsheet 3 contains sample ID descriptions for samples of meltwater collected from the tip site, and spreadsheet 4 contains sample ID descriptions for on-site operational monitoring samples. Spreadsheets 5,6,7,8,9 contain the raw data for the field trial.\n\n#########\n\nSome terms and abbreviations used in these datasets are:\n\nLR - low range\nMR - mid range\nCorr - corrected for drift\nQC - in-house spiked standard (multicomponent metals)\nRinse - de-ionised water rinse through ICP-MS to check for contamination or carryover NIST - NIST standard 1640: trace metal water standard (NIST stands for National Institue of Standards and Technology) Ref Values - expected values from analysis of the NIST standard DilBlk - dilution blank\nConcentration AVG - average concentration (of three readings)\n\n#########\n\nThis work was carried out as part of ASAC project 1300 (ASAC_1300) - Development and application of technologies for the removal of heavy-metal contaminants from run-off associated with abandoned waste disposal sites.\n\nSome of the fields in this dataset are:\n\nIsotope\nDilution\nRinse\nAnalysis\nSample\nSeawater",
