    "description": "The story of Lake Pontchartrain and its surrounding Basin is a fascinating\nsaga. Created at the end of the last Ice Age, this estuary is much more than\njust a magnificent natural resource. It has provided humans with sources of\nfood, as well as a means of communication, transportation and commerce. These\nand a host of other benefits have supported the growth of New Orleans and the\nsurrounding communities.\n\nToday, the 1632 km2 (630 mi2) Lake Pontchartrain is the centerpiece of the\n12,173 km2 (4,700 mi2) Pontchartrain drainage basin or watershed. The Basin\nencompasses land in 16 Louisiana parishes and 4 Mississippi counties. This vast\necological system includes lakes, rivers, bayous, forest, swamps and marshes.\nIt is habitat for countless species of fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and\nplants. It is also the most densely populated portion of Louisiana with almost\n1.5 million people residing immediately around the Lake.\n\nThe history of the environmental quality of the Pontchartrain Basin\ndemonstrates that no resource should be taken for granted or exploited. As the\npopulation grew in the Twentieth Century, use and, unfortunately, abuse of this\nnationally important estuary also grew. By the second half of the Twentieth\nCentury, Pontchartrain's environmental quality had deteriorated to a point that\nmany believed unrecoverable.\n\nResponsibility and stewardship are necessary for natural resource protection,\nrestoration and preservation. Recognizing these needs, area citizens began the\nSAVE OUR LAKE movement that led to the creation of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin\nFoundation in 1989. The Foundation's mission is to coordinate the overall\nrestoration and preservation of the entire Lake Pontchartrain Basin ecosystem.\nThe Environmental Atlas of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin will become one of our\ntools to help accomplish that mission.\n\nThe Environmental Atlas of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin is more than a summary\nof Pontchartrain's ecology. It presents information about geology, land cover,\ntypes of shorelines, biological resources, flow patterns, significant storms,\ngrowth trends and more. This Atlas is more of a directory to the Basin's\nenvironment. Hopefully, it will become an easily understandable reference for\nstudents and the public as well as a readily used source for professionals.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
