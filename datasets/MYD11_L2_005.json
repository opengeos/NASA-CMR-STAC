    "description": "The MYD11_L2.005 dataset was decommissioned as of April 9, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua version-5 (V5) level-2 LST/E data (Shortname: MYD11_L2) incorporate 1-km pixels, which are produced daily at 5-minute increments using the generalized split-window algorithm. This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of atmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into tractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in Bands 31 and 32 are estimated from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe data inputs include the MODIS L1B calibrated and geolocated radiances, geolocation, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, land and snow cover. The V5 MYD11_L2 data set comprises swath data obtained in 5-minute sensor collection periods, and includes the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers: LST, quality control assessment, error estimates, Bands 31 and 32 emissivities, zenith angle of the pixel view, observation time, and the geographic coordinates for every five scan lines and samples. Produced daily, MYD11_L2 is an unprojected level-2 product, which provides the input for the level-3 products.\r\n\r\nThe V5 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11_L2, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\n\r\nThe V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.  Please refer to the LP DAAC MODIS product table at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/myd11_l2  for additional detailed product version information.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~2330 km x 2000 km lat/long \r\nImage Dimensions: 2030 x 1354 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~6 MB compressed\r\nResolution: ~1000 meters \r\nProjection: None (swath data)\r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 9\r\nTemporal Range: 2002-07-04 to 2017-03-31",
