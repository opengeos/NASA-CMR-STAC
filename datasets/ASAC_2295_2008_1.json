    "description": "This research was a manipulative experiment on a chartered fishing vessel that was chartered to control the confounding effects. Future users of the data should be familiar with the associated published paper, especially the Introduction (which spells out the context) and Methods. Users should also be familiar with the latin square experimental design and take note of Table 1 in the published paper. It would also help if they are familiar with the use of fine scale time-depth recorders in determining the sink times/rates of objects in water.\n\nThere are three files attached. The first is an excel file called 'Line shooter headers for analysis'. This file includes the day number in the experiment, the numbers of the time-depth recorders, the CSV files, the treatments, deployment sequence, the water entry times and notes on data quality. Reference to the Methods section of the paper will clarify any uncertainties. The other two folders attached contain the TDR csv files. They are presented as files for Day 1 and files for Day 2 (the experiment ran over two days). The csv's are simply time versus depth. There are several sink profiles in each TDR. The water entry times for each sink profile are in the header spreadsheet, each csv needs to be matched with the header file. We did with code written in 'R' software (see the Methods section in the paper). The same thing could be done manually, if needed, but it would be very time consuming.",
