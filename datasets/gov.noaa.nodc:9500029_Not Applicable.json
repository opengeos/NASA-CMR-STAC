    "description": "The Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) and other data were collected in Bering Sea as part of Inner SHelf Transfer and recycling (ISHTAR) and \"St. Lawrence Island Polynya\" project. Data was collected from Ship ALPHA HELIX cruise HX-177. The data was collected over a period spanning from May 3, 1994 and June 8, 1994. Dr. Jackie Grebmeir, Univ. of Tenn., Knoxville was Principal Investigator funde by NSF Grant OPP-9000694. Data from 105 stations was received by NODC via Dr. Chirk Chu, University of Alaska, Institute of Marine Science, Fairbanks, AK. Data is in F022-CTD-Hi Resolution file format of NODC.\n\nF022 High-resolution CTD data is collected from high resolution (conductivity-temperature-depth) instruments. As they are lowered and raised in the oceans, these electronic devices provide nearly continuous profiles of temperature, salinity and other parameters. Data values may be subject to averaging or filtering or obtained by interpolation and may be reported at depth intervals as fine as 1 m. Cruise and instrument information, position, date, time and sampling interval are reported for each station. Environmental data at the time of the cast (meteorological and sea surface conditions) may also be reported. The data record comprises values of temperature, salinity or conductivity, density (computed sigma-t) and possibly dissolved oxygen or transmissivity at specified depth or pressure levels. Data may be reported at either equally or unequally spaced depth or pressure intervals.",
