    "description": "Geology was researched and compiled for use in studies of ecosystem health,\nenvironmental impact, soils, groundwater, land use, tectonics, crustal genesis,\nsedimentary provenance, and any others that could benefit from geographically\nreferenced geological data.\n\nThe Washington DC Area geologic map database (DCDB) provides geologic map\ninformation of areas to the NW, W, and SW of Washington, DC to various\nprofessionals and private citizens who have uses for geologic data.  Digital,\ngeographically referenced, geologic data is more versatile than traditional\nhard copy maps, and facilitates the examination of relationships between\nnumerous aspects of the geology and other types of data such as: land-use data,\nvegetation characteristics, surface water flow and chemistry, and various types\nof remotely sensed images.  The DCDB was created by combining Arc/Info\ncoverages, designing a Microsoft (MS) Access database, and populating this\ndatabase.  Proposed improvements to the DCDB include the addition of more\ngeochemical, structural, and hydrologic data. \n\nData are provided in several common GIS formats and MS Access database files. \nThe geologic data themes included are bedrock, surficial, faults and fold axes,\nneat line, structural data, and sinkholes; the base themes are political\nboundaries, roads, elevation contours, and hydrography.\n\nData were originally collected in UTM coordinates, zone 18, NAD 1927, and\nprojected to geographic coordinates (Lat/Long), NAD 1983.  The data base is\naccompanied by large format color maps, a readme.txt file, and a explanatory\nPDF pamphlet.",
