    "description": "      Annual crop data from 1972 to 1998 are now available on\n      EOS-WEBSTER. These data are county-based acreage, production, and\n      yield estimates published by the National Agricultural Statistics\n      Service. We also provide county level livestock, geography,\n      agricultural management, and soil properties derived from datasets\n      from the early 1990s.\n      \n      The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the statistical\n      arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, publishes U.S., state, and\n      county level agricultural statistics for many commodities and data\n      series. In response to our users requests, EOS-WEBSTER now provides 27\n      years of crop statistics, which can be subset temporally and/or\n      spatially. All data are at the county scale, and are only for the\n      conterminous US (48 states + DC).  There are 3111 counties in the\n      database.  The list includes 43 cities that are classified as\n      counties: Baltimore City, MD; St. Louis City, MO; and 41 cities in\n      Virginia.\n      \n      In addition, a collection of livestock, geography, agricultural\n      practices, and soil properties variables for 1992 is available through\n      EOS-WEBSTER. These datasets were assembled during the mid-1990's to\n      provide driving variables for an assessment of greenhouse gas\n      production from US agriculture using the DNDC agro-ecosystem model\n      [see, for example, Li et al. (1992), J. Geophys. Res., 97:9759-9776;\n      Li et al. (1996) Global Biogeochem. Cycles, 10:297-306].  The data\n      (except nitrogen fertilizer use) were all derived from publicly\n      available, national databases. Each dataset has a separate DIF.\n      \n      The US County data has been divided into seven datasets.\n      \n      US County Data Datasets:\n      \n      1) Agricultural Management\n      2) Crop Data (NASS Crop data)\n      3) Crop Summary (NASS Crop data)\n      4) Geography and Population\n      5) Land Use\n      6) Livestock Populations\n      7) Soil Properties\n",
