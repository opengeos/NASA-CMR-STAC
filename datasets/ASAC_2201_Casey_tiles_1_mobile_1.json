    "description": "The recruitment of mobile epifauna on hard-substratum was examined in a field experiment using tiles. A total of 160 tiles were deployed at five locations, with 32 tiles at each location, arranged in a spatially nested design. There were three potentially impacted locations locations (two in Brown Bay and one in Shannon Bay) and two control locations (in O'Brien Bay).\n\nThis metadata record describes data from the first sampling time only. Eight tiles were collected from each location 15 months after the initial deployment. The experiment was setup so that the combined recruitment of mobile epifauna to the upper and lower sides of the tiles could be examined. The sessile epifauna on the tiles were also collected and are described in a separate metadata record.\n\nA total of 40 samples are included in this data.\n\nAlso links to ASAC 1100.",
