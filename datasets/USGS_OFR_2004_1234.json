    "description": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a cooperative program of the U.S.\nGeological Survey, the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska\nFairbanks, and the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, has\nmaintained seismic monitoring networks at historically active volcanoes in\nAlaska since 1988. The primary objectives of this program are the near real\ntime seismic monitoring of active, potentially hazardous, Alaskan volcanoes and\nthe investigation of seismic processes associated with active volcanism. This\ncatalog presents the calculated earthquake hypocenter and phase arrival data,\nand changes in the seismic monitoring program for the period January 1 through\nDecember 31, 2003.\n\nThe AVO seismograph network was used to monitor the seismic activity at\ntwenty-seven volcanoes within Alaska in 2003. These include Mount Wrangell,\nMount Spurr, Redoubt Volcano, Iliamna Volcano, Augustine Volcano, Katmai\nvolcanic cluster (Snowy Mountain, Mount Griggs, Mount Katmai, Novarupta,\nTrident Volcano, Mount Mageik, Mount Martin), Aniakchak Crater, Mount\nVeniaminof, Pavlof Volcano, Mount Dutton, Isanotski Peaks, Shishaldin Volcano,\nFisher Caldera, Westdahl Peak, Akutan Peak, Makushin Volcano, Okmok Caldera,\nGreat Sitkin Volcano, Kanaga Volcano, Tanaga Volcano, and Mount Gareloi.\nMonitoring highlights in 2003 include: continuing elevated seismicity at Mount\nVeniaminof in January-April (volcanic unrest began in August 2002),\nvolcanogenic seismic swarms at Shishaldin Volcano throughout the year, and\nlow-level tremor at Okmok Caldera throughout the year. Instrumentation and data\nacquisition highlights in 2003 were the installation of subnetworks on Tanaga\nand Gareloi Islands, the installation of broadband installations on Akutan\nVolcano and Okmok Caldera, and the establishment of telemetry for the Okmok\nCaldera subnetwork. AVO located 3911 earthquakes in 2003.\n\nThis catalog includes: (1) a description of instruments deployed in the field\nand their locations; (2) a description of earthquake detection, recording,\nanalysis, and data archival systems; (3) a description of velocity models used\nfor earthquake locations; (4) a summary of earthquakes located in 2003; and (5)\nan accompanying UNIX tar-file with a summary of earthquake origin times,\nhypocenters, magnitudes, phase arrival times, and location quality statistics;\ndaily station usage statistics; and all HYPOELLIPSE files used to determine the\nearthquake locations in 2003. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
