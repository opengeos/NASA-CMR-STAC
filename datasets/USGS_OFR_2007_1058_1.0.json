    "description": "Gravity data were collected from 2004 through 2006 to assist in mapping\nsubsurface geology in the northern Willamette Valley and vicinity, northwestern\nOregon and southwestern Washington. Prior to this effort to improve the gravity\ndata coverage in the study area, very little regional data were available. This\nreport gives the principle facts for 2710 new gravity stations and 1446\npreexisting gravity stations. Much of the study area is now covered with data\nof sufficient density to define basin boundaries and correlate with many of the\nlarger fault systems.\n\nThe study area lies between 44\u00b0 52.5' and 46\u00b0 N latitude and between 122\u00b0\n15' and 123\u00b0 37.5' W longitude. Although this is a continuing project and more\ngravity data is expected to be collected, this report is being published to\nshow the progress of the data collection. The majority of these data are spaced\nat about 1.6 km (1 mile), but three closely spaced profiles were measured in\nthe Portland area across several faults. To obtain a 1.6 km grid of data points\nwould require about 5120 gravity stations. To date we have collected 2710\nstations. Including the preexisting data points, the total number of stations\nis 4156, and complete regional coverage is about 80 percent at this time.",
