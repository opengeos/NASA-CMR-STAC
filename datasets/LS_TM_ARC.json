    "description": "Landsat 5 was launched on March 1, 1984, carrying a seven-band TM sensor, and\nstill operates properly at present. The satellite takes a sun-synchronized\norbit with 705km altitude and 98.22 deg. inclination.\n\nA TM scene covers 185km by 170km earth surface approximately, with 30m ground\nresolution for band 1,2,3,4,5,7 and 120m for band6. For a particular place, the\nrevisit cycle of the satellite is 16 days.\n\nChaina Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station(CRSGS) was inaugurated and\nbecome operational in Dec. 1986. Up to now it is the most important source of\nremote sensing satellite data in China for earth resouce exploration and\nenvironment monitoring.\n\nCRSGS has provided a large amount of satellite remote sensing products to more\nthan 400 users, domestic and abroad. Applications of TM images have resulted\nin great economic and social benefits in a wide range of areas of national\neconomy: resource survey and utilization, environment monitoring, geographic\ncartography, minerarl exploration, disaster detecting and assessing, etc.\n\nTM data received by CRSGS since 1986 have been archived. Through a Catalogue\nArchive and Browse System(CABS), users can retrieve useful information about\ndata of interests. A image(or a group of images) could be searched according\nto date, location(latitude-longitude or path-row), and quality, etc. Text\ncatalogue is available for all TM data in the archival. In addition to text\ncontents, sub-sampled browse images are available for data acquired after\nApr.,1994.\n\nThe major products of CRSGS are TM data on CCTs, floppy disks and imagery on\nfilms or papaer prints. Products fall into two categories with respect to\nprocessing methods.\n1. Standard processing\nincludes systematic correction, precision correction, and geocoding, etc.\n2.Special product(user dependent)\nincludes multi-scene mosaicking, image classification, user defined annotation\nor administrative boundary adding, special juts enhancement, etc.",
