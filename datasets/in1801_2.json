    "description": "Oceanographic measurements were collected aboard RV Investigator cruise in1801 (CSIRO voyage designation in2018_v01) from 11th January to 22nd February 2018, along CLIVAR Southern Ocean repeat meridional section SR3, followed by Adelie land shelf stations, small meridional sections along 150E (the south end of CLIVAR section P11S) and 132E, and several stations along CLIVAR zonal section S4. A total of 108 CTD vertical profile stations were taken on the cruise, most to within 14 metres of the bottom. Over 2800 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate+nitrite, silicate, ammonia and nitrite), CFC's plus tracers (CFC-11, CFC-12, SF6 and N2O), dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. TCO2), alkalinity, pH, C13/C14, genomics, HPLC, POC, chlorophyll, radiogenic isotopes, helium, ice nucleation, and Ca/Mg, using a 36 bottle rosette sampler. Full depth current profiles were collected by an LADCP attached to the CTD package. Upper water column current profile data were collected by a ship mounted ADCP (75 kHz). Trace metal rosette and in situ pump deployments were done at some of the CTD stations. Meteorological and water property data were collected by the array of ship's underway sensors. A large assortment of 29 drifting floats was deployed throughout the cruise. A detailed data report is included with the data set, with summary of all CTD data and important data quality information.\n\nThe data set contains CTD 2dbar averaged data, and Niskin bottle data (core hydrochemistry of salinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrients, plus CFC-11, CFC-12, SF6 and N2O), in text and matlab formats. A WOCE (CCHDO) 'exchange' format version of the data is also available from the CCHDO data centre.",
