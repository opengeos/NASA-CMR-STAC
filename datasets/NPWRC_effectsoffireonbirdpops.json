    "description": "The mixed-grass prairie is one of the largest ecosystems in North America,\noriginally covering about 69 million hectares (Bragg and Steuter 1995).\nAlthough much of the natural vegetation has been replaced by cropland and other\nuses (Samson and Knopf 1994, Bragg and Steuter 1995), significant areas have\nbeen preserved in national wildlife refuges, waterfowl production areas, state\ngame management areas, and nature preserves. Mixed-grass prairie evolved with\nfire (Bragg 1995), and fire is frequently used as a management tool for prairie\n(Berkey et al. 1993). \n\nMuch of the mixed-grass prairie that has been protected is managed to enhance\nthe reproductive success of waterfowl and other gamebirds, but nongame birds\nnow are receiving increasing emphasis. Despite the importance of the area to\nnumerous species of birds and the aggressive management applied to many sites,\nrelatively little is known about the effects of fire on the suitability of\nmixed-grass prairie for breeding birds. Several studies have examined effects\nof fire on breeding birds in the tallgrass prairie (e.g., Tester and Marshall\n1961, Eddleman 1974, Halvorsen and Anderson 1983, Westenmeier and Buhnerkempe\n1983, Zimmerman 1992, Herkert 1994), in western sagebrush grasslands (Peterson\nand Best 1987), and in shrubsteppe (Bock and Bock 1987). \n\nStudies of fire effects in the mixed-grass prairie are limited. Huber and\nSteuter (1984) examined the effects on birds during the breeding season\nfollowing an early-May prescribed burn on a 122-ha site in South Dakota. They\ncontrasted the bird populations on that site to those on a nearby 462-ha\nunburned site that had been lightly grazed by bison (Bison bison). Pylypec\n(1991) monitored breeding bird populations occurring in fescue prairies of\nCanada on a single 12.9-ha burned area and on an adjacent 5.6-ha unburned\nfescue prairie for three years after a prescribed burn.",
