    "description": "Relative abundance, breeding ecology, annual survival, home range, and\nforaging ecology of the Akiapolaau (Hemignathus munroi), an endangered Hawaiian\nhoneycreeper, were studied on the island of Hawaii.  The species is a\nspecialist; Akiapolaau used koa (Acacia koa) for foraging much more than\nexpected based on koa availability, and most Akiapolaau occurred in old-growth\nkoa and ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha forests.  Male Akiapolaau most often\nforaged on the trunks and large branches of koa, whereas females used small\nbranches and twigs.  The longer bill of males is apparently adapted to the\ngreater bark thickness of larger branches.  Lichen-covered and dead branches\nwere preferred feeding sites.  Akiapolaau showed serial monogamy and had a\nrelatively low reproductive rate of 0.86 young per par per year, with a long\nparental dependency period.  Home range sizes averaged 10.7 ha and did not\ndiffer between males and females.  Annual survival for adults was 0.71.  Avian\ndiseases appear to restrict Akiapolaau to higher elevation forests where\nmosquitos are rare.  Protection of remaining old-growth koa and ohia forests\nabove the mosquito zone are critical to the survival of the species.\n\n   Geographic Description:\n   Akiapolaau were studied at five study sites on Hawaii: Keauhou\nRanch (19.52, -155.33; 1,740 m elevation), Kilauea Forest (19.52,\n-155.32 1,630 m), Hamakua (19.78 -155.33; 1,770 m), Kau Forest (19.22,\n-155.65; 1,750 m), and a Dry Forest site (19.82, -155.55 1,865-2,800\nm). 1.5.2 Bounding Rectangle Coordinates\n\n   Methodology:\n   25-162 stations were surveyed each month at each study site using the\nvariable circular-plot method with 8-minute counts (Scott et al. 1986) to\nobtain indices of Akiapolaau abundance.",
