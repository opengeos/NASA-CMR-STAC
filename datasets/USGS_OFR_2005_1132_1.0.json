    "description": "High-resolution aeromagnetic surveys of the Amargosa Desert region, California\nand Nevada, exhibit a diverse array of magnetic anomalies reflecting a wide\nrange of mid- and upper-crustal lithologies. In most cases, these anomalies can\nbe interpreted in terms of exposed rocks and sedimentary deposits. More\ndifficult to explain are linear magnetic anomalies situated over lithologies\nthat typically have very low magnetizations. Aeromagnetic anomalies are\nobserved, for example, over thick sections of Quaternary alluvial deposits and\nspring deposits associated with past or modern ground-water discharge in Ash\nMeadows, Pahrump Valley, and Furnace Creek Wash. Such deposits are typically\nconsidered nonmagnetic. To help determine the source of these aeromagnetic\nanomalies, we conducted ground-magnetic studies at five areas: near Death\nValley Junction, at Point of Rocks Spring, at Devils Hole, at Fairbanks Spring,\nand near Travertine Springs. Depth-to-source calculations show that the sources\nof these anomalies lie within the Tertiary and Quaternary sedimentary section.\nWe conclude that they are caused by discrete volcanic units lying above the\npre-Tertiary basement. At Death Valley Junction and Travertine Springs, these\nconcealed volcanic units are probably part of the Miocene Death Valley volcanic\nfield exposed in the nearby Greenwater Range and Black Mountains. The linear\nnature of the aeromagnetic anomalies suggests that these concealed volcanic\nrocks are bounded and offset by near-surface faults. \n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
