    "description": "The data are in two forms, organismal and molecular.  The former are\n      the results of enrichment culture experiments for the following groups\n      of organisms:  anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (purple and green\n      bacteria); sulfate-reducing bacteria; sulfur-oxidizing\n      chemolithotrophic bacteria.  In some cases enrichment culture\n      experiments were negative, but in many others, cultures were obtained\n      and many of these are now pure (axenic) cultures.  These organisms are\n      currently being characterized to define their basic properties.  Many\n      turn out to be new species and some show distinct cold adaptation.\n      All are capable of growth at low temperatures.  The molecular data are\n      the results of analyses of DNA isolated from permanently frozen\n      Antarctic lakes.  Specific probes have been used that target the\n      phototrophic and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria described above.  The\n      probes allow for analyses of diversity and metabolic activity of each\n      group of organisms with depth in the lake. Overal l, the results yield\n      a picture of the microbial diversity and activities of key bacteria\n      important to the ecology of permanently frozen lakes in the McMurdo\n      dry valleys.",
