    "description": "CER_ES9_Terra+Aqua_Edition4 is the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)-like Gridded Instantaneous Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA) Fluxes Terra and Aqua Cross-track Edition4 data product. Data for this product is collected through the CERES-Flight Model 1 (FM1) and FM2 on the Terra platform and FM3 and FM4 on the Aqua platform. Data collection for this product is ongoing.\r\n\r\nThe ERBE-like Monthly Regional Averages (ES-9) product contains a month of space and time-averaged CERES data for both the Terra and Aqua satellites using measurements from the primary cross-track instrument. All instantaneous shortwave and longwave (LW) fluxes at the TOA from the CERES ES-8 product for a month are sorted by 2.5-degree spatial regions, by day number, and by the local hour of observation. The mean of the instantaneous fluxes for a given region-day-hour bin is determined and recorded on the ES-9, along with other flux statistics and scene information. For each region, the daily average flux is estimated from an algorithm that uses the available hourly data, scene identification data, and diurnal models. This algorithm is \"like\" the algorithm used for ERBE. ES-9 also contains hourly average fluxes for the month and an overall monthly average for each region. These average fluxes are given for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes.\r\n\r\nCERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful ERBE mission. The first CERES instrument, the proto flight model (PFM), was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit onboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched onboard Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua on May 4, 2002. The CERES FM5 instrument was launched onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The newest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched onboard the Joint Polar-Orbiting Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) satellite, now called NOAA-20, on November 18, 2017.",
