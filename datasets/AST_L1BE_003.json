    "description": "The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Expedited Level 1B Registered Radiance at the Sensor global data product is radiometrically calibrated and geometrically co-registered. Application of intra-telescope and inter-telescope registration corrections for all bands are relative to the reference band for each telescope: Visible  and Near Infrared (VNIR) Band 2, Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) Band 6, and Thermal Infrared (TIR) Band 11. The Expedited Level 1B data product is similar to the (AST_L1B) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1B.003) with a few notable exceptions. These include:\r\n* The AST_L1BE is available for download within 48 hours of acquisition in support of field calibration and validation efforts, in addition to emergency response for natural disasters where the quick turn-around time from acquisition to availability would prove beneficial in initial damage or impact assessments.\r\n* The registration quality of the AST_L1BE is likely to be lower than the AST_L1B, and may vary from scene to scene.\r\n* The AST_L1BE dataset does not contain the VNIR 3B (aft-viewing) Band.\r\n* This dataset does not have short-term calibration for the Thermal Infrared (TIR) sensor.",
