    "description": "The ANARE Lambert Glacier Basin (LGB) series of oversnow traverses were conducted during the period 1989-95. Field operations were carried out along the proximity of the 2500 m elevation contour around the interior basin between Mawson and Davis stations. The main traverse route covered some 2014 km of track from LGB00 at 68.6543 S, 61.1201 E, and LGB72 at 69.9209 S, 76.4933 E. Ice sheet surface velocities were obtained for 73 sites known as Ice Movement Stations (IMS), spaced approximately 30 km apart between LGB00 and LGB72.\n\nRaw data were recorded in Wild-Leitz (WM102) or Leica-Wild (200-series) proprietary mode including data, observation, almanac and ephemeris files. Processed data were stored in proprietary software output modes and has been written to standard spreadsheet (MS Excel) files for sharing with downstream processing programs. The data available at the url below are stored in various formats.\n\nSummary data (2 km spatial average) can be obtained from CRC Research Note No. 23, 'Ice Sheet Surface Velocities along the Lambert Basin Traverse Route'.\n\nDocuments providing archive details of the logbooks are available for download from the provided URL.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 3 and 2216.",
