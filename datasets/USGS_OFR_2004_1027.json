    "description": "During spring 2002, the chemical composition of annual snowpacks in the Rocky\nMountain region of the Western United States was analyzed. Snow samples were\ncollected at 75 geographically distributed sites extending from New Mexico to\nMontana. Near the end of the 2002 snowfall season, the snow-water equivalent\n(SWE) in annual snowpacks sampled generally was below average in most of the\nregion. Regional patterns in the concentrations of major ions (including\nammonium, nitrate, and sulfate), mercury, and stable sulfur isotope ratios are\npresented.\n\nThe 2002 snowpack chemistry in the region differed from the previous year.\nSnowpack ammonium concentrations were higher at 66 percent of sites in Montana\ncompared to concentrations in the 2001 snowpack but were lower at 74 percent of\nsites in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. Nitrate was lower at all Montana\nsites and lower at all but one Wyoming site; nitrate was higher at all but two\nColorado sites and higher at all New Mexico sites. Sulfate was lower across the\nregion at 77 percent of sites. The range of mercury concentrations for the\nregion was similar to those of 2001 but showed more variability than ammonium,\nnitrate, and sulfate concentrations. Concentrations of stable sulfur isotope\nratios exhibited a strong regional pattern with values increasing northward\nfrom southern Colorado to northern Colorado and Wyoming.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
