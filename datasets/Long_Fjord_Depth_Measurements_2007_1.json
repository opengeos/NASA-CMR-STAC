    "description": "Water depth measurements were taken in Long Fjord during early winter in 2007.  The measurements were collected by Graham Cook, station leader at Davis Station in the Australian Antarctic Territory.  The measurements were made by dropping a weighted line off the back of a quad bike, after drilling a hole through the sea ice.  Measurements were made approximately every 100 metres.\n\nThe download file contains a csv spreadsheet which lists each waypoint, plus the corresponding water depth and any comments. The text file contains the waypoint information collected by the Garmin GPS unit.  Data in the text file are comma separated and are interpreted as follows:\n\nWP,D,001 (waypoint) , -68.51341000,  78.06903000,(Latitude and Longitude) 05/25/2007, 10:25:35, (Date and time Downloaded to Computer) 24-MAY-07 11:40:42 (Date and time of reading).  Time is in local time.\n\nVegetation was found on the weight that we used when we first started at the seaward end of the Fjord and then again in shallow water between Brookes Hut and a small island 800 or 900 metres out from Brookes. The weight is quite smooth and does not pick up a lot.\n\nThe reference given below provides some further information about previously collected bathymetry data in Long Fjord. Furthermore, also see the metadata records:\n\n'Bathymetric data of Long and Tryne Fjords at Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, collected in December 1999 [VH_bathy_99]'\n\n'Interpolated bathymetry of Long and Tryne Fjords, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica [long_tryne_bathy]'\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nWaypoint\nLatitude\nLongitude\nWater Depth\nDate\nTime",
