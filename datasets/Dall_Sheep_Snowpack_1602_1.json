    "description": "This dataset provides daily estimates of snow depth and snow density for the study area in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve (LCNPP), Alaska. The data were generated using SnowModel and used as snow covariates along with landscape covariates in modeling efforts to study Dall sheep movements in response to dynamic snow conditions. Thirty adult Dall sheep (12 male, 18 female) were captured and outfitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars programmed to acquire locations every seven hours. Given the individual sheep locations, their distances to land cover (e.g., shrub, forest, glacier), landscape characteristics (e.g., elevation, terrain ruggedness index (TRI), vector ruggedness measure (VRM), slope, and aspect), snow depth and density, MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and other covariates were determined and are provided in the environmental data file. The snow density and depth data are provided at 25-m, 100-m, 500-m, 2000-m, and 10000-m grid resolutions, at 1-day increments, and cover the period September 1, 2005 through August 31, 2008. The sheep, snow, and landscape data cover the years 2006, 2007, and 2008.",

White points are locations from multiple Dall sheep from March through 5 April 2006. The base heatmap depicts the relative, conditional probability of use on 1 April 2006 as predicted by the best model from our second, fine-scale analysis. Hotter colors correspond to higher relative probabilities of use by sheep. White asterisks denote SNOTEL stations. The two insets (a, b) were arbitrarily chosen to depict model predictions of space use along east-west and north-south gradients (from Mahoney et al., 2018).",
