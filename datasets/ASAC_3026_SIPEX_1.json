    "description": "This work was completed as part of the SIPEX - Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment - voyage.\n\nAdapted from the SIPEX website:\n\nDuring SIPEX we investigated the biogeochemistry of iron (Fe), including a comprehensive examination of its distribution, speciation (i.e. the different forms of Fe), cycling and its role in fuelling sea ice-based and pelagic algal communities. A major part of this research concentrated on the influence of organic exopolysaccharides (EPS) on Fe solubility and its bio-availability. The distribution of other bioactive trace elements was also examined as a means of fingerprinting the source(s) of Fe, as well as indicating their biological requirements.\n\n#########\n\nData on the small- to medium scale (0.1-1000 m) spatial and temporal distribution of Fe and EPS in sea ice cores, surface snow, brine and underlying seawater were  determined in each sampled medium by the interdisciplinary team working on the SIPEX project (AAS 3026) in the East Antarctic sector in September/October 2007. Data include Chlorophyll a, salinity, temperature, sea-ice thickness, ice texture analysis, macro-nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, silicate), oxygen stable isotopes, POC and DOC, EPS, iron. \n\nThis work was completed as part of AAS (ASAC) project 3026.  See the parent metadata record (ASAC_3026) for more information.",
