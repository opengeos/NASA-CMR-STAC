    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo white-sky albedo for ShortWave (VNP43D78) is produced daily using 16 days of data at 30 arc second (1,000 meter) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The VNP43D product suite is provided in a Climate Modeling Grid (CMG), which covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each VNP43D product contains just one data layer. \n\nVNP43D54 through VNP43D79 are the albedo products of the VNP43D BRDF/Albedo product suite. Black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values are provided for the nine VIIRS moderate resolution bands (M1 through M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11) along with the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands included in the [VNP43MA3](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43MA3.002) product. In addition to the bands included in VNP43MA3, this product suite includes albedo values for the VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB). The black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a diffuse component and is a function of solar zenith angle. White-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a direct component when the diffuse component is isotropic. Details regarding methodology are available on the [VNP43MA3](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43MA3.002) product page and in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\n\nVNP43D78 is the WSA for the VIIRS shortwave broadband (1.61 \u03bcm).\n\nKnown Issues\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Version\n* Improved calibration algorithm and better coefficients for entire Suomi NPP mission.\n* Improved geolocation accuracy and updates to fix outliers around maneuver periods and other events.\n* Corrections to the aerosol quantity flag (low, average, high) mainly over brighter surfaces in the mid to high latitudes such as desert and tropical vegetation areas. This has an impact on the retrieval of other downstream data products such as VNP13 Vegetation Indices and VNP43 BRDF/Albedo.\n* Improved cloud mask input product for corrections along coastlines and artifacts from use of coarse resolution climatology data.\n* Replaced the land/water mask input product with MODIS heritage seven class land/water mask.\n",
