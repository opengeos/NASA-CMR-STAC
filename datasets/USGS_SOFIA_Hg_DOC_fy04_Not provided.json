    "description": "This project is designed to more clearly define the factors that control the occurrence, nature, and reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Florida Everglades, especially with regard to the biological transformation and accumulation of mercury (Hg). The primary objectives of our research are (1) to more clearly define the factors that control the occurrence, nature and reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Florida Everglades, and (2) to quantify the effects of DOM on the transport and reactivity of Hg, especially with regard to the biological transformation and accumulation of mercury (Hg) in the Everglades. To meet these objectives, we have adopted a combined field/ laboratory approach. In conjunction with other research projects our field efforts are designed (1) to characterize DOM at a variety of field locations chosen to provide information about the influences of hydrology, seasonal factors (wetting and drying events) and source materials (e.g. vegetation, periphyton, peat) on the nature and amount of DOM in the system, and (2) to elucidate the roles of DOM in controlling the reactivity and bioavailability of Hg in the Everglades.\n\nThis research is relevant because of the high natural production of organic carbon in the peat soils and wetlands, the relatively high carbon content of shallow ground water systems in the region, the interactions of organic matter with other chemical species, such as trace metals, divalent cations, mercury, and anthropogenic compounds, the accumulation of organic carbon in corals and carbonate precipitates, and the potential changes in the quality and reactivity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) resulting from land use and water management practices. Proposed attempts to return the Everglades to more natural flow conditions will result in changes to the current transport of organic matter from the Everglades Agricultural Area and the northern conservation areas to Florida Bay. In addition, the presence of dissolved organic matter is important in the production of drinking water, contributes to pollutant transport, and will influence ASR performance. Finally, interactions of mercury (Hg) with organic matter play important roles in controlling the reactivity, bioavailability and transport of Hg in the Everglades.",
