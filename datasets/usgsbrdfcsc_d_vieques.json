    "description": "The Vieques Island Mapping Project was initiated in September 1995 as a\ncooperative effort between NSRR and the Sirenia Project (Military\nInterdepartmental Purchase Request no.  NOO38995MP00012).  Caribbean Fisheries\nConsultants, Inc. was contracted by the Sirenia Project to help produce the\ndesired information in conjunction with Sirenia Project biologists.  Products\ninclude maps delineating Vieques' benthic habitat and coastal wetlands, an\nelectronic georeferenced habitat map (UTM coordinate system) in a format\ncompatible with ARC/INFO (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.)  and\na report describing methods used, the classification scheme, and the\nrelationship of these habitats to manatee use of Vieques Island. These map\nproducts complement the Navy's Vieques Land Use Management Plan by identifying\nmarine resources targeted for protection in the plan.\n\nObjectives include producing maps of the coastal seagrass beds and other bottom\nhabitat (including coral reefs) surrounding the island of Vieques and\ncharacterizing the species composition and density of seagrasses in areas\nfrequented by manatees near Vieques.\n\nGround truthing by boat around Vieques Island was conducted from May 14 to May\n19 1996 and from October 4 through October 9 1996.  The ground truthing was\nconducted to verify the interpretation of benthic habitat visible in the\nimages, verify accuracy of the shoreline limits, and refine the habitat\nclassification scheme used for the Vieques maps.  Three hundred and thirty-two\nground truth stations were established around Vieques Island, located on the\naerial image overlays, and digitized.  These sites are plotted as a layer on\nthe habitat map.  The listing of ground truth sites includes site identifier,\nlatitude and longitude, community classification, depteh, dominant community\nelements, less dominant elements, and other pertinent information.  Latitude\nand longitude were obtained for each station in the field using a Garmin 45 GPS\nunit.  Water depth for each station was determined from a Hummingbird LCR - 400\nVideo Fathometer with transom mounted transducer. Underwater Hi-8 video and 35\nmm photography were used to document observations at selected sites.\n\nThe habitat classification scheme used is similar to that used by Kruer and\nothers in southern Forida seagrass beds and other benthic habitats in the\nFlorida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Biscayne National Park. This scheme,\nalso used for benthic habitat mapping at NSRR in 1994/1995 (Kruer 1995), was\nrefined for the Vieques Island mapping project by adding the category \"sand\nbottom with rock\".  Also, mangroves were mapped in interior areas. \n\nThe information for this metadata was partially taken from the report\n- Mapping and characterization of Nearshore Benthic Habitats around Vieques\nIsland, Puerto Rico.",
