    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L3 Binned Snow impurities (16days,1/12deg) is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km.  This product includes snow impurities. Snow impurities applies lookup tables have been constructed by using atmospheric optical properties obtained from MODTRAN in conjunction with the DISORT radiative transfer code. The bi-directional reflectance of snow is taken into account. In the lookup tables the radiances that would be measured by the satellite instrument are simulated as a function of snow grain size and mass fraction of soot mixed in the snow. The snow grain size and mass fraction of soot are obtained by requiring the simulated radiances to be consistent with the measured ones in both GLI channel 5 and 19. Level 2 snow impurities, grain size and surface temperature product (SNGI_p) is used as input data. The physical quantity is ppmw. This product includes sum, square sum, max, min of each pixel is included.The provided format is HDF. The spatial resolution is 1/12 degree and the statistical period is 16 days, also 1month statistics is available. Map projection is EQA and PS. The generation unit is Global, North and South Hemisphere. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
