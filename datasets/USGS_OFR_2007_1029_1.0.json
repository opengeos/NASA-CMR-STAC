    "description": "In 2005, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Trade and\nDevelopment Agency contracted with the U.S. Geological Survey to perform\nassessments of the natural resources within Afghanistan. The assessments\nconcentrate on the resources that are related to the economic development of\nthat country. Therefore, assessments were initiated in oil and gas, coal,\nmineral resources, water resources, and earthquake hazards. All of these\nassessments require geologic, structural, and topographic information\nthroughout the country at a finer scale and better accuracy than that provided\nby the existing maps, which were published in the 1970's by the Russians and\nGermans. The very rugged terrain in Afghanistan, the large scale of these\nassessments, and the terrorist threat in Afghanistan indicated that the best\napproach to provide the preliminary assessments was to use remotely sensed,\nsatellite image data, although this may also apply to subsequent phases of the\nassessments. Therefore, the first step in the assessment process was to produce\nsatellite image mosaics of Afghanistan that would be useful for these\nassessments. This report discusses the production of the Landsat false-color\nimage database produced for these assessments, which was produced from the\ncalibrated Landsat ETM+ image mosaics described by Davis (2006).\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
