    "description": "Overview of the project and objectives:\n\nTo investigate whether the Nitrogen - Silicon - Carbon biogeochemical system functions in the Antarctic Marginal Ice Zone and shows spatial variability possibly induced by varying availability of Fe and other parameters in the region. This toolbox is part of project 4051 - samples were taken (1) on the same sea-ice site or very close than the one used for Trace Metal sampling; (2) via Trace Metal Rosette TMR; (3) via Conductivity Temperature and Depth CTD Rosette. It is also part of project 4073 since some intercalibration studies were conducted in collaboration with the primary production team. \n\nThree main tools were used which can be either independently or intricately studied. For this reason the complete set of sampling done for this stable isotope toolbox is summarized in one excel file which is duplicated and attached to three child metadata records. Same reasoning for raw data acquired on boar and on field information. \n\nThis parent metadata record has thus three child metadata records. Each of the child metadata files explain individually the different approaches which were treated together by the same team to resolve the main question of sea-ice biogeochemical system functioning via the use of stable isotope ratio tools. The details of each are in the respective metadata records.\n\nThe data are attached to this metadata record.\n\nMETADATA FILES are:\n\n- 13C, 15N, 30Si in-situ incubation experiments during SIPEX 2\n- Nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate during SIPEX 2\n- Delta13C signal of brassicasterol and cholesterol in the Antarctic Sea-ice / Is there particulate barium in sea-ice?",
