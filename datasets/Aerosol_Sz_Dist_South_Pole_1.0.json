    "description": "This data set contains the physical aerosol size distributions\n      measured at the South Pole during December 1998 and December 2000.\n      \n      The size range covered by these measurements was 3 [nm] to 250 [nm] in\n      1998 and 3 [nm] to 2000 [nm] in 2000.\n      \n      For 1998 measurements, total particle concentration for Dp > ~ 3[nm]\n      and concentrations for 3 [nm] < Dp < 10 [nm] is available from\n      12/01/1998 to 12/31/1998 except over 12/09/1998 ~ 12/13/1998.  They\n      measured by the prototype Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counter,\n      equipped with Pulse Height Analysis (PHA-UCPC)\n      \n      Particle size distributions for 10 [nm] < Dp < 250 [nm] is available\n      from 12/16/1998 to 12/31/1998. They were measured by a Scanning\n      Mobility Particle Spectrometer.\n      \n      For 2000 measurements, total particle concentration for Dp > ~ 3[nm]\n      and concentrations for 3 [nm] < Dp < 10 [nm] is available from\n      12/01/2000 to 12/29/2000 except over 12/22/2000 ~ 12/24/2000.  They\n      measured by the white-light 3025 Ultrafine Condensation Particle\n      Counter, equipped with Pulse Height Analysis (PHA-UCPC)\n      \n      Particle size distributions for 10 [nm] < Dp < 250 [nm] is available\n      from 12/01/2000 to 12/29/2000. They were measured by a Scanning\n      Mobility Particle Spectrometer.\n      \n      A PMS LASAIR measured particle size distributions for 100 [nm] to 2000\n      [nm] from 12/01/2000 to 12/29/2000.\n      \n      Typical data collection frequencies are ~ 5 minutes in all\n      instruments.\n      \n      All length(size) units are in [um].\n      \n      Following are the meanings of the variables.\n         concentration [#/cc]: number of particles in a cubic centimeter of\n         air.\n      \n         surface area [um^2/cc]: surface area concentrations of particles,\n         assuming all particles are sphere.\n      \n         volume [um^3/cc]: volume concentrations of particles, assuming all\n         particles are sphere",
