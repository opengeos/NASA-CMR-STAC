    "description": "These OH rotational temperature data are derived from spectra collected with a Czerny-Turner scanning grating spectrometer operating at Davis station (69S, 78E), Antarctica (see Greet et al., 1998; French et al., 2000; Burns et al., 2002).\n\nHydroxyl (6-2) band rotational temperatures are derived using Langhoff et al (1986) transition probabilities. See French et al. (2000) for why we prefer these values.\n\nThe 1990 data are collected with the optical axis aligned 30-degrees above the horizon in a direction 130E from Davis. An order separating filter was not used in 1990. Details of the operation of the instrumentation in 1990 are included in Greet et al., (1998).\n\nThe 1990, 1994, 1995 and 1996 data are derived from OH(6-2) spectra collected as 5 consecutive scans accumulated in the order of 40 mins to 1 hour (see Burns et al., 2002).\n\nThe times listed for the 1990, 1994, 1995 and 1996 temperatures are calculated from the start time and end time of the accumulated spectrum, interpolated to the time of the P1(2) peak. Greater accuracy than this is not justified given the scanning nature of the instrument and the long acquire times.\n\nFrom 1997, temperatures are determined from piece-wise scans collected in ~7.5 minutes (see Burns et al., 2002). From 1997, the time for each temperature is between two consecutive spectra. The line intensities are linearly interpolated to this time.\n\nWe derive temperatures as often as possible (moon-up, minor auroral contamination, all cloud conditions). Auroral, cloud and moon-light contaminations are handled and investigated as described in Burns et al., (2002).\nWe have provided UT date and time, weighted temperatures, weighted standard error (less than 15K), weighted counting error (less than 10K) and a cloud code.\n\nThe weighted temperature, weighted counting error and weighted standard deviation are explained in Greet et al. (1998).\n\nThe cloud code is:\n0  clear skies\n1  thin high cirrus or haze\n2  patchy cloud\n3  overcast\n4  snow\n5  unknown\n\nSome discussion of the cloud observations is contained in Burns et al. (2002) and Greet et al. (1998).\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 701 (ASAC 701).  From 2013 onwards, the work falls under AAS project 4157.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nDate (UT)\nTime (UT)\nTemperature (K)\nCloud\n\nThe download file contains the raw data collected by the SPEX instrument, as well as the calculated temperature/hydroxyl values.  The download file also contains a summary file of the data from 1995-2018.",
