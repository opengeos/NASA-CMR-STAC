    "description": "The datasets contain values collected at 15 minute and hourly intervals for stage (water level), discharge (flow), salinity, and temperature between 1999 and 2006. The stage is measured in feet relative to NAVD 88, the discharge in cubic feet per second (cfs), temperature in degrees Celsius, and salinity in parts per thousand (ppt). The data are referenced to date and time in hours and minutes.\n\nJoe Bay is the primary hydrologic connection between the freshwater Everglades and northeastern Florida Bay. Flow and salinity monitoring by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has determined that Trout Creek is the largest contributor of freshwater flow to northeastern Florida Bay and is connected to Joe Bay (Hittle and others 2001). Sources of freshwater to Joe Bay include Taylor Slough and the C-111 Canal. Hydrologic parameters such as water level, discharge, and salinity observations in conjunction with water quality sampling have been useful in determining contributions of freshwater flow from Taylor Slough and C-111 Canal to Joe Bay (Zucker 2003). Hourly salinity data has been collected at four locations in Joe Bay since May 1999. In 2001, three index velocity stations were installed at Joe Bay 2E, Joe Bay 5C, and Joe Bay 8W. The current monitoring network in Joe Bay can assist with determining the effect upstream restoration efforts have on the timing and distribution of freshwater flows into northeastern Florida Bay.",
