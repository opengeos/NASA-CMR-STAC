    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data sets that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.\n\nThis data set consists of digitized polygons of constant hydraulic conductivity\nvalues for the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer in east-central Oklahoma. The Vamoosa-Ada\naquifer is an important source of water that underlies about 2,320-square miles\nof parts of Osage, Pawnee, Payne, Creek, Lincoln, Okfuskee, and Seminole\nCounties. Approximately 75 percent of the water withdrawn from the Vamoosa-Ada\naquifer is for municipal use. Rural domestic use and water for stock animals\naccount for most of the remaining water withdrawn. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is\ndefined in a ground-water report as consisting principally of the rocks of the\nLate Pennsylvanian-age Vamoosa Formation and overlying Ada Group. The\nVamoosa-Ada aquifer consists of a complex sequence of fine- to very\nfine-grained sandstone, siltstone, shale, and conglomerate interbedded with\nvery thin limestones. The water-yielding capabilities of the aquifer are\ngenerally controlled by lateral and vertical distribution of the sandstone beds\nand their physical characteristics. The Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is unconfined where\nit outcrops in about an 1,700-square-mile area.\n\nThe hydraulic conductivity of the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer was computed as 3 feet\nper day in a ground-water report. Most of the hydraulic conductivity polygons\nwere extracted from published digital geology data sets. The lines in the\ndigital geology data sets were scanned or digitized from maps published at a\nscale of 1:250,000 and represent geologic contacts. Some of the lines in the\ndata set were interpolated in areas where the Vamoosa-Ada aquifer is overlain\nby alluvial and terrace deposits near streams and rivers.",
