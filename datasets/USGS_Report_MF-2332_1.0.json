    "description": "This database and accompanying plot files depict the distribution of geologic\nmaterials and structures at a regional (1:100,000) scale. The report is\nintended to provide geologic information for the regional study of materials\nproperties, earthquake shaking, landslide potential, mineral hazards, seismic\nvelocity, and earthquake faults. In addition, the report contains new\ninformation and interpretations about the regional geologic history and\nframework.  However, the regional scale of this report does not provide\nsufficient detail for site development purposes.  In addition, this map does\nnot take the place of fault-rupture hazard zones designated by the California\nState Geologist (Hart and Bryant, 1997).  Similarly, the database cannot be\nused to identify or delineate landslides in the region.\n\nThis digital map database, compiled from previously published and unpublished\ndata, and new mapping by the authors, represents the general distribution of\nbedrock and surficial deposits in the mapped area.  Together with the\naccompanying text file (pamf.ps, pamf.pdf, pamf.txt), it provides current\ninformation on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the area covered. \nThe database delineates map units that are identified by general age and\nlithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution (scale) of\nthe database to 1:62,500 or smaller.\n\nThe attached text file mf2332.rev contains current revision numbers for all\nparts of this product.\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (Arc/ Info\ncoverages) and supporting text and plotfiles.  In addition, the report includes\ntwo sets of plotfiles (PostScript and PDF format) that will generate map sheets\nand pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Miscellaneous Field Studies Report.\n These files are described in the explanatory pamphlets (pamf.ps, pamf.pdf,\npamf.txt).  The base map layer used in the preparation of the geologic map\nplotfiles was scanned from a scale-stable version of the USGS 1:100,000\ntopographic map at a resolution of 300 dpi as a monochrome TIFF image. The\nraster data was converted to a GRID in Arc/Info, and combined with geologic\npolygon data to produce the final map image.  The base map coverages included\nwith the database publication are vectorized versions of scans of scale-stable\nseperates.  These coverages contain no database information other than\nposition, and are included for reference only. In both cases the map digitized\nwas the Palo Alto (1982 version) 1: 100,000 quadrangle, which has a 50-meter\ncontour interval.",
