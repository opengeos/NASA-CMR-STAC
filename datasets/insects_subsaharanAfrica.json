    "description": "One of the most basic needs for inventorying, exploiting and\n            monitoring the changes in the insect diversity of Africa is a complete\n            list of species which are already know to occur in\n            Africa. Surprisingly, such a basic list does not exist, despite some\n            250 years of formal scientific description of life on earth. The\n            International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), along\n            with the National Museum of Natural History, is therefore sponsoring\n            the production of the list, which will provide a reliable platform of\n            'standard' names for species on which many other projects depend. This\n            list, or authority file, will greatly enhance communication both among\n            scientists and between scientists and users of scientific data. The\n            African list will also be a major contribution toward the proposed\n            list of world species (e.g. the Global Biodiversity Information\n            Facility (GBIF) and Species 2000 initiative of DIVERSITAS).\n            \n            A demonstration database is provided for the species of the orders\n            Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), Ephemeroptera (mayflies),\n            Plecoptera (stoneflies), Megaloptera (alderflies),\n            Hemiptera-Heteroptera (true bugs), Homoptera (cicadas, leafhoppers,\n            planthoppers, scales, and others), and Trichoptera (caddisflies).\n            \n            Invitation to collaboration: Compilation of the checklist is being\n            coordinated by Nearctica (formerly Entomological Information\n            Specialists), because of their experience with Nomina Insecta\n            Nearctica. We are attempting to collaborate with known specialists as\n            contributors and reviewers, but we welcome additional suggestions of\n            collaborators. Inquires can be directed to Scott Miller\n            (miller.scott@nmnh.si.edu).\n            \n            Information was obtained from\n            \"http://entomology.si.edu/\".",
