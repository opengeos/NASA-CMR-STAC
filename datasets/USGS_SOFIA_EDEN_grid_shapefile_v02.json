    "description": "This shapefile serves as a net (fishnet or grid) to be placed over the South Florida study area to allow for sampling within the 400 meter cells (grid cells or polygons).\nThe origin and extent of the Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) grid were selected to cover not only existing Airborne Height Finder (AHF) data and current regions of interest for Everglades restoration, but to cover a rectangular area that includes all landscape units (USACE, 2004) and conservation areas in place at the time of its development. This will allow for future expansion of analyses throughout the Greater Everglades region should resources allow and scientific or management questions require it. Combined with the chosen extent, the 400m cell resolution produces a grid that is 675 rows and 375 columns..\n\nThe shapefile contains the 253125 grid cells described above. Some characteristics of this grid, such as the size of its cells, its origin, the area of Florida it is designed to represent, and individual grid cell identifiers, could not be changed once the grid database was developed. These characteristics were selected to design as robust a grid as possible and to ensure the grid\u2019s long-term utility.",
