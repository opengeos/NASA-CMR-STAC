    "description": "The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general circulation models (GCMs). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud data.To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992). Each mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical processes of the cloud systems.The Colorado State radiometer data set was produced by the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of CSU as part of the FIRE Phase II Cirrus Intensive Field Observations (IFO) conducted in Coffeyville, Kansas. The CSU PRT-6 data were collected during the period from Nov. 18, 1991 (day 322) to Dec. 7, 1991 (day 341) at the Parsons KG&E Power Plant, Parsons, Kansas (37 deg. 18 min. N and 95 deg. 07 min.W). The PRT-6 is an all-purpose chopped bolometer. It was operated with a 2 degree field of view pointing vertically upward. The filter employed narrowed the spectral band to ranges from about 885 to 945 inversecentimeters (the infrared window region). The PRT-6 was not run in continuous mode. When operating, data were sampled every 5 seconds. Please note that there are temporal gaps in the data.",
