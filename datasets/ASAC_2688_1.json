    "description": "Preliminary Metadata record for data expected from ASAC Project 2688 See the link below for public details on this project.\n\n'Cold outbreaks' are severe meteorological events which have significant impacts on many aspects economic and social life in mid-latitude communities. This project will lead to a better scientific understanding of these events, and particularly will quantify the role played by the Antarctic topography and sea ice. The research will reveal how their frequency and intensity have changed over recent decades, and how these might be expected to change under global warming.\n\nThis project used data from various sources for it's analysis, and as such did not produce any data of it's own.  The findings are presented in various publications, some of which are available for download to AAD staff only at the provided URL.\n\nData sources included:\nStation data of daily maximum temperature and rainfall for Melbourne and Perth Australian Bureau of Meteorology\n\nNational Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) (Washington USA) reanalysis\n\nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (Reading, UK) ERA-40 Re-Analysis dataset\n\nSea ice data from National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) (Boulder, USA)",
