    "description": "A collection of sea ice observations made during the Antarctic Division BIOMASS Experiment III (ADBEX III) cruise of the Nella Dan, during Oct - Dec 1985 (along with some additional observations made from the Icebird during the same period). Data that they intended to capture (but didn't always record) was ice cover (in 10ths), snow thickness, ice thickness, shape of ice and bergs, size of ice and bergs, the sea swell, number of bergs visible, water temperature, and general comments.\n\nAt the same time, several aerial flights were taken over the sea ice, with photographs taken to record the ice makeup. Flight lines for these flights, notes on the equipment setup, and rough analysis of the photos (types of ice, quantity of ice) were also recorded.\n\nThese written records are archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.",
