    "description": "This dataset consists of 67 DNA sequences of the alkane mono-oxygenase gene. The sequence data are in FASTA format which can be opened with word-processing as well as sequence analysis software. \n\nThe clone library was created using the primers described by Kloos et al. (2006, Journal Microbiological Methods 66:486-496) F: AAYACNGCNCAYGARCTNGGNCAYAA and R:GCRTGRTGRTCNGARTGNCGYTG. \n\nThe library was created from a marine sediment sample that was part of the SRE4 marine biodegradation experiment in O'Brien bay near Casey station. The sample used was from the sediment exposed to Special Antarctic Blend diesel 5-weeks after the time of deployment. \n\nThese data were collected as part of AAS project 2672 - Pathways of alkane biodegradation in antarctic and subantarctic soils and sediments.",
