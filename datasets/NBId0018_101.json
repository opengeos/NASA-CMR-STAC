The maps were prepared by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), USA.  Most data for\nthe database were provided by the Soil Resources, Management and Conservation Service, Land and Water Development Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Italy. This dataset was developed\nin collaboration with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Kenya.  The base maps used were the UNESCO/FAO Soil Map of the world (1977) in Miller Oblated Stereographic projection, the DMA Global\nNavigation and Planning charts for Africa (various dates: 1976-1982) and the Rand-McNally, New International Atlas (1982).  All sources were re-registered to the basemap by comparing known features on the basemap those of the source maps. The digitizing was done with a spatial resolution of 0.002 inches. The maps were then transformed from inch coordinates to latitude/longitude degrees. The transformation was done using an unpublished algorithm of the US Geological Survey and ESRI to create coverages for one-degree\ngraticules.  The Population Centers were selected based upon their inclusion in the list of major cities and populated areas in the Rand McNally New International Atlas Contact: UNEP/GRID-Nairobi, P.O.
