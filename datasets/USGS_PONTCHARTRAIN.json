    "description": "Lake Pontchartrain and adjacent lakes in Louisiana form one of the larger\nestuaries in the Gulf Coast region. The estuary drains the Pontchartrain Basin\n(at right), an area of over 12,000 km2 situated on the eastern side of the\nMississippi River delta plain. In Louisiana, nearly one-third of the State\npopulation lives within the 14 parishes of the basin.\n\nOver the past 60 years, rapid growth and development within the basin, along\nwith natural processes, have resulted in significant environmental degradation\nand loss of critical habitat in and around Lake Pontchartrain. Human activities\nassociated with pollutant discharge and surface drainage have greatly affected\nthe water quality in the lake. This change is evident in the bottom sediments,\nwhich record the historic health of the lake. Also, land-altering activities\nsuch as logging, dredging, and flood control in and around the lake, lead to\nshoreline erosion and loss of wetlands.The effects of pollution, shoreline\nerosion and wetland loss on the lake and surrounding areas have become a major\npublic concern.\n\nTo better understand the basin's origin and the processes driving its\ndevelopment and degradation requires a wide-ranging study involving many\norganizations and personnel. When the U.S. Geological Survey began the study of\nLake Pontchartrain in 1994, information on four topics was needed:\n\n-Geologic Framework, or how the various sedimentary layers that make up\nthe basin are put together\n\n-Sediment Characterization, that is, what are the sediments made of, where\ndid they come from, and what kinds of pollutants do they contain\n\n-Shoreline and Wetland Change over time\n\n-what are the processes that control Water Circulation \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
