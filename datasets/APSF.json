    "description": "The Aerial Photography Single Frame Records collection is a large and diverse group of imagery acquired by Federal organizations from 1937 to the present. Over 6.4 million frames of photographic images are available for download as medium and high resolution digital products. The high resolution data provide access to photogrammetric quality scans of aerial photographs with sufficient resolution to reveal landscape detail and to facilitate the interpretability of landscape features. Coverage is predominantly over the United States and includes portions of Central America and Puerto Rico. Individual photographs vary in scale, size, film type, quality, and coverage.",

Please note that this site uses Session Cookies and Java applets.\n         \n         EarthExplorer offers two digital download options for the Aerial Photography Single Frame Records collection. The files are stored in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).   Medium Resolution Digital Aerial Products were created with a digital single-lens reflex camera at a resolution of 63 microns, or 400 dots per inch (dpi). The file size for a nine inch photograph is approximately 15 megabytes (MB) for a black-and-white image and 45 MB for a color image.  High Resolution Digital Aerial Products were created with a digital scanning back at a resolution of 25 microns, or 1,000 dpi. A geometric calibration is applied to each image to correct for distortions caused by the scanning process. The high resolution scans provide access to high precision data for photogrammetric applications. The file size for a nine inch photograph is approximately 110 MB for a black-and-white image and 330 MB for a color image.  The USGS has a records schedule that transfers film sources to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for permanent storage. Aerial photographs that meet the records schedule criteria become the responsibility of NARA and are retrievable for reproductions through NARA or its vendor companies. The USGS will maintain medium and high resolution data for film sources that are no longer stored at EROS.\n      ",
