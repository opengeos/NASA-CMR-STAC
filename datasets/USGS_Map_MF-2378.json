    "description": "The map is intended as a tool for regional planning.  Any site-specific\n      planning or analysis should be undertaken with the assistance of a qualified\n      geotechnical engineer.  This hazard map should not be used as a substitute to\n      the State of California Seismic Hazard Zones map for the same area.  (See\n      California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology, 1999). As\n      previously noted for maps of this type by Wieczorek and others (1985), this map\n      should not be used as a basis to determine the absolute risk from seismically\n      triggered landslides at any locality, as the sole justification for zoning or\n      rezoning any parcel, for detailed design of any lifeline, for site-specific\n      hazard-reduction planning, or for setting or modifying insurance rates.\n      \n      This map describes the possible hazard from earthquake-induced landslides for\n      the city of Berkeley, CA.  The hazard depicted by this map was modeled for a\n      scenario corresponding to an  M=7.1 earthquake on the Hayward, CA fault.  This\n      scenario magnitude is associated with complete rupture of the northern and\n      southern segments of the Hayward fault, an event that has an estimated return\n      period of about 500 years.  The modeled hazard also corresponds to completely\n      saturated ground-water conditions resulting from an extreme storm event or\n      series of storm events.  This combination of earthquake and ground-water\n      scenarios represents a particularly severe state of hazard for earthquake-\n      induced landslides.  For dry ground-water conditions, overall hazard will be\n      less, while relative patterns of hazard are likely to change.",
