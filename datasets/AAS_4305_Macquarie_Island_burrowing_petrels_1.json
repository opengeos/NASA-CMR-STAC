    "description": "This dataset is the Supplementary Material for a review of uncertainty in petrel population estimates. It contains raw data from the literature review, source code for the full analysis, and additional text accompanying the manuscript.\n\nRaw data were extracted from a literature review of petrel population estimates on islands. References were sourced from the Web of Science bibliographic index searched on 20 January 2020 using the search terms \"burrowing seabird\" OR \"burrow-nesting seabird\" OR \"burrow-nesting petrel\" OR \"burrowing petrel\" OR \u201cscientific name\u201d OR \u201ccommon name\u201d (taxonomy followed HBW and BirdLife International, 2018) for all species in the families Procellariidae, Hydrobatidae and Oceanitidae, AND \u201cabundance\u201d OR \u201cpopulation\u201d in the title, abstract or keywords. \n\nThe data contain the original reference with metadata on year, journal, species studied, island studied, motivations for the study. We extracted published population estimates reported in each paper. Most represented a mean, but where only minima or maxima were reported we used this as the estimate, and where only minima and maxima were reported we used their average as the estimate. To allow comparison between studies we extracted basic dispersion statistics and manipulated them to approximate confidence intervals (see paper for methods).\n\nThe full dataset includes:\n1. data.csv - the raw data from the literature review including information for 60 variables.\n\n2. supplementary_code.rmd - full code for the analysis.\n\n3. Supplementary material.docx - supporting text including methods, results and references.",
