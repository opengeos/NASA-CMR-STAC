    "description": "The objectives of the study are: To quantify through detailed field experiments previously unstudied processes in the Everglades, such as rates of fine-particle movement and filtration by vegetation as well as advective solute exchange between surface water and zones of solute storage in relatively stagnant waters (in areas of thick vegetation and in peat pore water). Our study focuses on determining the effects of these processes on chemical reactions of the contaminants as well as overall effects on downstream transport. At least initially, the emphasis will be on improved understanding of factors influencing transport of dissolved and fine particle forms of phosphorus. To apply the new knowledge gained from field measurements first in our own transport models (which are necessarily limited in time and space) and then to encourage application in more widely used water-quality models (e.g. DMSTA, ELM), and water quality models currently in development (e.g. extension of USGS SICS model in Taylor Slough). The goal is more accurate simulation of the effects of restoration on Everglades water quality, thus allowing more reliable use of water-quality models for prediction of the effects of restoration. To guide the use of improved water-quality models to estimate potential rates of transport, storage, and remobilization of phosphorus (and other contaminants) in WCA-2A, Shark and Taylor Sloughs in Everglades National Park, and Loxahatchee Wildlife Refuge, with a goal to predict potential rates of downstream movement of phosphorus in these systems under \"restored\" flows.\n\nA key measure of success in the Everglades restoration is protecting water quality while increasing the quantity of water flowing through the Everglades. The restoration's goal of increasing surface-water flow through the wetlands could have the unintended consequence of transporting contaminants farther into the Everglades than ever before. Thus, the need to augment water delivery will at times inevitably result in using water with higher than desirable total dissolved solids, particulate organic matter, sulfate, nutrients, and mercury. In addition, greater water flows may increase transport of those contaminants farther into the wetlands than ever before. Our investigation seeks a better understanding of the fundamental processes that affect the rates at which contaminants are transported in wetlands, focusing especially on critical unknowns - 1) rates of contaminant transport in association with fine suspended particles, and 2) rates of solute exchange between surface water and storage areas reservoirs in relatively stagnant surface waters (in thick vegetation and subsurface pore water in peat). Our studies are planned to be the definitive experimental investigations of solute and particle transport in the Everglades.",
