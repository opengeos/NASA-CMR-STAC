    "description": "The Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends (BEST) program is\ndesigned to assess and monitor the effects of environmental contaminants on\nbiological resources, particularly those under the stewardship of the\nDepartment of the Interior. BEST examines contaminant issues at national,\nregional, and local scales, and uses field monitoring techniques and\ninformation assessment tools tailored to each scale. As part of this program,\nthe threat of contaminants and other anthropogenic activities to terrestrial\nvertebrates residing in or near to Atlantic coast estuarine ecosystems is being\nevaluated by data synthesis and field activities. One of the objectives of this\nproject is to evaluate the relative sensitivity and suitability of various\nwildlife species for regional contaminant monitoring of estuaries and\necological risk assessment.\n\nThe purpose of the data is to assess and monitor the effects of environmental\ncontaminants on biological resources, particularly those under the stewardship\nof the Department of the Interior.
