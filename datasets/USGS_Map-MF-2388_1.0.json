    "description": "The report may be used for land-use planning (e.g., selecting land-fill sites,\ngreenbelts, avoiding geologic hazards), for finding aggregate resources\n(crushed rock, sand, and gravel), and for study of geomorphology and Quaternary\ngeology. The report identifies geologic hazards (e.g., landslides, swelling\nsoils, heaving bedrock, and flooding) if they are known to be located in, or\ncharacteristic of, mapped units.  Surficial deposits in the quadrangle are\nevidence of depositional events of the Quaternary Period (the most recent 1.8\nmillion years). Some events such as floods are familiar to persons living in\nthe area, while others preceded human occupation. The latter include\nglaciation, probable large earthquakes, protracted drought, and widespread\ndeposition of sand and silt by wind. At least twice in the past 200,000 years\n(most recently from about 30,000 to 12,000 years ago) global cooling caused\nglaciers to form on Pikes Peak and in the high parts of the Sangre de Cristo\nMountains. Some glaciers advanced down valleys, deeply eroded the bedrock, and\ndeposited moraines (map units tbk, tbg, tbj, tbi) and deposited outwash (ggq,\ngge), in the Wet Mountain Valley. On the plains (east part of map area), eolian\nsand (es), stabilized dune sand (ed), and loess (elb) are present and in places\ncontain buried paleosols, which indicate sand dune deposition alternating with\nperiods of stabilized landscape during which soils developed.\n\nFifty-three types of surficial geologic deposits and residual materials of\nQuaternary age are described in a pamphlet and located on a map of the greater\nPueblo area, in part of the Front Range, in the Wet and Sangre de Cristo\nMountains, and on the plains east of Colorado Springs and Pueblo. Deposits\nformed by landslides, wind, and glaciers, as well as colluvium, residuum,\nalluvium, and others are described in terms of predominant grain size, mineral\nor rock composition (e.g., gypsiferous, calcareous, granitic, andesitic),\nthickness, and other physical characteristics. Origins and ages of the deposits\nand geologic hazards related to them are noted. Many lines drawn between units\non our map were placed by generalizing contacts on published maps. However, in\n1997-1999 we mapped new boundaries as well. The map was projected to the UTM\nprojection. This large map area extends from near Salida (on the west edge),\neastward about 107 mi (172 km), and from Antero Reservoir and Woodland Park on\nthe north edge to near Colorado City at the south edge (68 mi; 109 km). \n\nCompilation scale: 1:250,000. Map is available in digital and print-on-demand\npaper formats. Deposits are described in terms of predominant grain size,\nmineralogic and lithologic composition, general thickness, and geologic\nhazards, if any, and relevant geologic historical information and paleosoil\ninformation, if any. Fifty-three map units of deposits include alluvium,\ncolluvium, residuum, eolian deposits, periglacial/disintegrated deposits,\ntills, landslide units, glaciofluvial units, and a diamicton. A bedrock map\nunit depicts large areas of mostly bare bedrock.\n\nThe physical properties of materials were compiled from published soil and\ngeologic maps and reports, our field observations, and from earth science\njournal articles. Selected deposits in the field were checked for conformity to\ndescriptions of map units by the Quaternary geologist who compiled the\nsurficial geologic map units.\n\n>puebpoly: polygon coverage containing geologic unit contacts and labels.\n>puebline: arc coverage containing faults.\n>puebpnt:  point coverage containing point locations of decorative\n>          bar-and-ball symbols for faults.\n>geol_sfo.lin:  This lineset file defines geologic line types in the\n>               geologically themed coverages.\n>geoscamp2.mrk:  This markerset file defines the geologic markers in the\n>                geologically themed coverages.\n>color524.shd:  This shadeset file defines the cmyk values of colors\n>               assigned to polygons in the geologically themed coverages.",
