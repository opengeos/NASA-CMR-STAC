    "description": "NARSTO_SOS99NASH_WP3D_CHEMISTRY_DATA is the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) SOS99 Nashville WP-3D Orion Air Chemistry Data product. It was obtained between June 26 and July 19, 1999 during the WP3-D aircraft component of the Nashville 1999 study sponsored in part by the Southern Oxidant Study. The organizations participating in the study included Aircraft Operations Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Dept of Commerce; Aeronomy Laboratory, U.S. Dept of Commerce; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR); Brookhaven National Laboratory; and University of Denver. \r\n\r\nThere were 12 flights in the mission. Measurements focused on obtaining an improved understanding of the processes that control the formation and distribution of fine particles and ozone. Measurements included in the data files are: aircraft location data, aerosol particle characteristics; upper air meteorology; CO, ozone, NO, NO2, NOy, HNO3, SO2, CO2; NMHCs; photolysis rate coefficients from Actinic flux measurements; PAN, PPN, and MPAN; and formaldehyde. \r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
