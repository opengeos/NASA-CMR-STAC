    "description": "Exopolysaccharide (EPS) is complex sugar made by many microbes in the Antarctic marine environment.  This project seeks to understand the ecological role of microbial EPS in the Southern Ocean, where it is known to strongly influence primary production.  We will investigate the chemical composition and structure of EPS  obtained from Antarctic microbes, which will improve our knowledge of its ecological significance and biotechnological potential.\n\nDataset includes the following:\n\n1) Information on Exopolysaccharide-producing bacterial isolates, isolation sites, media used and growth conditions.\n\n2) 16S rRNA gene sequence and fatty acid data of isolates for strain identification.\n\n3) Exopolysaccharide chemistry data including EPS carbohydrate composition, organic acid composition, sulfate content, molecular weight.\n\n4) Physiology of exopolysaccharide synthesis. Effects of temperature and other factors on EPS yield and glucose conversion efficiency.\n\n5) Iron binding properties.\n\nThe download file includes:\n11 files\nFile 1. Bacterial isolate 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from Southern Ocean seawater or ice samples. The sequences are all deposited on the GenBank nucleotide (NCBI) database. Sequences are in FASTA format.\nFile 2. Seawater and sea-ice sample information including sites samples, sample type.\nFile 3. Data for exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteria isolated and subsequently selected for further studied. Information indicates special treatments used to obtain strains including plankton towing, filtration method, and enrichment. Identification to species level was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.\nFile 4. EPS-producing bacterial isolate fatty acid content determined using GC/MS procedures.\nFile 5. Basic chemical data for EPS from Antarctic isolates including protein, sulfate, and sugar type relative content (determined by chemical procedures), molecular weight in kilodaltons and polydispersity (determined by gel-based molecular seiving).\nFile 6 Monosaccharide unit composition determined by GC/MS of EPS from Antarctic isolates.\nFile 7. Effect of temperature on culture viscosity and growth of EPS-producing bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. CAM025 as affected by temperature.\nFile 8. Effect of temperature on EPS and cell yields and EPS synthesis efficiency (as indicated by glucose consumption) of EPS-producing bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. CAM025 as affected by temperature.\nFile 9. Efficiency of copper and cadmium metal ion adsorption onto EPS from EPS-producing bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. CAM025.\nFile 10. Phenotypic characteristics data for novel EPS-producing Antarctic strain CAM030. Represents type strain of Olleya marilimosa.\nFile 11. Effect of temperature on chemical make up of EPS from EPS-producing bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. CAM025.",
