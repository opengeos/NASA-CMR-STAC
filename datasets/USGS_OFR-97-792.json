    "description": "Devils Hole is a tectonically formed cave developed in the discharge zone of a\nregional aquifer in south-central Nevada. (See Riggs, et al., 1994.) The walls\nof this subaqueous cavern are coated with dense vein calcite which provides an\nideal material for precise uranium-series dating via thermal ionization mass\nspectrometry (TIMS). Devils Hole Core DH-11 is a 36-cm-long core of vein\ncalcite from which we obtained an approximately 500,000-year-long continuous\nrecord of paleotemperature and other climatic proxies. Data from this core were\nrecently used by Winograd and others (1997) to discuss the length and stability\nof the last four interglaciations. These data are given in table 1\n(http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr97-792/)\n\nThese records have provided information that has posed several challenges to\nthe orbital theory of the causation of the Pleistocene glaciations, suggested\ninsights regarding the duration of current Holocene climate, provided a new\nchronology for the Vostok, Antarctica, ice core paleotemperature record, and\nyielded insights on the age of the groundwater in the principal aquifer of\nsouthern Nevada (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/ofr02-266/)\n\nCarbon and oxygen stable isotopic ratios were measured on 285 samples cut at\nregular intervals inward from the free face of the core (as reported in\nWinograd et al. ,1992, and in Coplen et al., 1994). Table 1 lists only 284\nsamples because a sample taken at 114.28 mm was eliminated when post-1994\nreanalysis of its delta 18O value indicated an error in the earlier\ndetermination. Carbon isotopic ratios are reported in per mill  relative to\nVPDB, defined by assigning a delta 13C of +1.95 per mill to the reference\nmaterial NBS 19 calcite. Oxygen isotopic ratios are reported relative to VSMOW\nreference water on a scale normalized such that SLAP reference water is -55.5\nper mill relative to VSMOW reference water. The oxygen isotopic fractionation\nfactors employed in this determination are those listed in Coplen and others\n(1983). The delta 18O value of the isotopic reference material NBS 19 on this\nscale is +28.65 per mill. The \u00b1 1 sd (standard deviation) error for the delta\n18O and delta 13C analyses is \u00b10.07 and 0.05 per mill, respectively.\n\nAges were estimated by linear interpolation between age control points taken at\nkey intervals in the core and analyzed by TIMS 230Th-234U-238U dating. The age\nestimates in Table 1 are based on the original 21 control points (see Table 2\nin Ludwig, et al., 1992, and Figure 2 in Winograd, et al., 1992) as well as for\nthe recently obtained TIMS age of 143.8\u00b10.9 ka (2 sd analytical error) at 51.5\nmm (Winograd, et al., 1997). The later sample was taken specifically for\nadditional control in a critical portion of the core. Errors in the ages vary\nbut are bounded by the errors in the appropriate control points.
