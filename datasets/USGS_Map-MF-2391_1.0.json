    "description": "This map provides geologic information for land-use decisions.\n\nGeologic mapping, in support of the USGS Omaha-Kansas City Geologic Mapping\nProject, shows the spatial distribution of artificial-fill, alluvial, eolian,\nand glacial deposits and bedrock in and near Omaha, Nebraska. Artificial fill\ndeposits are mapped chiefly beneath commercial structures, segments of\ninterstate highways and other major highways, railroad tracks, airport runways,\nand military facilities, and in landfills and earth fills.  Alluvial deposits\nare mapped beneath flood plains, in stream terraces, and on hill slopes.  They\ninclude flood-plain and stream-channel alluvium, sheetwash alluvium, and\nundivided sheetwash alluvium and stream alluvium. Wind-deposited loess forms\nsheets that mantle inter-stream areas and late Wisconsin terrace alluvium.\nPeoria Loess is younger of the two loess sheets and covers much of the\ninter-stream area in the map area.  Loveland Loess is older and is exposed in a\nfew small areas in the eastern part of the map area. Glacial deposits are\nchiefly heterogeneous, ice-deposited, clayey material (till) and minor\ninterstratified stream-deposited sand and gravel.  Except for small outcrops,\nglacial deposits are covered by eolian and alluvial deposits throughout most of\nthe map area.  Bedrock is locally exposed in natural exposures along the major\nstreams and in quarries. It consists of Dakota Sandstone and chiefly limestone\nand shale of the Lansing and Kansas City Groups. Sand and gravel in flood plain\nand stream-channel alluvium in the Platte River valley are used mainly for\nconcrete aggregate. Limestone of the Lansing and Kansas City Groups is used for\nroad-surfacing material, rip rap, and fill material.\n\nSurficial deposits are mapped where they are estimated to be at least 1 m\nthick.  Most of the surficial deposits are poorly exposed. The surficial\ndeposits were locally observed in foundation excavations, road cuts, and other\nexposures in 1995 and 1996.  Thin, discontinuous sheetwash alluvium (Qsw) and\nsmall artificial-fill deposits (af) were not mapped.  Small outcrops of\nLoveland Loess, till, Dakota Sandstone, and limestone outcrops of the Lansing\nand Kansas City Groups that are too small to map are shown as symbols. Mapping\nin and near Omaha is modified from that of Miller (1964, plates 2 and 3 at\n1:24,000 scale).  Mapping in the rest of the map area is based primarily on\ninterpretation of 1:15,840- and 1:20,000-scale county soil maps (Bartlett,\n1975; Borchers and others, 1984; Branham, 1989; Nixon, 1982) and interpretation\nof aerial photography, supplemented by examination of artificial and natural\nexposures.  The aerial photography includes: 1:40,000-scale, black-and-white,\naerial photographs taken in April and May 1990 and in March and April 1993, and\nalso 1:60,000-scale, color infrared, aerial photographs taken in May 1981 and\nApril 1982.  Age assignments for surficial deposits are based in part on soil\ndevelopment. Soil-horizon designations and textural terms, such as silt loam\nand clay loam, are those of the Soil Survey Staff (1975).  Grain-size ranges\ngiven for surficial deposits are estimates that are based on the modified\nWentworth scale (American Geological Institute, 1982). Dry matrix colors of the\nsurficial deposits were determined by comparison with Munsell Soil Color Charts\n(Munsell Color, 1973).  In general, colors of the surficial deposits are\nsimilar to those of the bedrock and other materials from which the deposits\nwere derived. Unweathered to slightly weathered surficial deposits observed in\nthe map area commonly range from gray (5Y 6/1) to very pale brown (10YR 8/4).\nIn this report, the terms \"alluvium\" and  \"alluvial\" refer to surficial\nmaterial transported by running water confined to channels (stream alluvium) as\nwell as material transported by running water not confined to channels\n(sheetwash alluvium). The term \"colluvial\" here refers to surficial material\ntransported down slopes chiefly by mass-movement (gravity-driven) processes,\nsuch as creep. All of the radiocarbon and thermoluminescence ages in this\nreport are uncalibrated.  The thickness and grain-size ranges of surficial map\nunits are based chiefly on interpretation of approximately 300 unpublished\ndrill-hole logs and approximately 30 water-well logs on file with the\nConservation and Survey Division, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and test-hole\ndata summarized by Burchett (1965) and Burchett and Smith (1989a, 1989b).\nMetric units are used in this report.
