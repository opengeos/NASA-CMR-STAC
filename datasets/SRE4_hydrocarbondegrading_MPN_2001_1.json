    "description": "Most probable number counts of bacteria in sediment samples from the Sediment Recruitment Experiment 4. Samples were taken immediately after the collection of sediment, after the addition of the oils to the sediment and after five weeks in-situ incubation.\n\nSediment was treated by the addition of oil (four different types: synthetic lubricant, used synthetic lubricant, biodegradable lubricant and special Antarctic blend diesel) and the number of bacteria able to degrade components of Special Antarctic Blend diesel (SAB) was determined using an MPN method on a marine mineral medium with Special Antarctic Blend diesel as sole carbon source.\n\nData are presented as the most-probable-number of bacteria per gram of wet sediment.\n\nSee also the metadata record 'SRE4_hydrocarbondegrading_MPN_2006'.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 1228.\n\nThe download file contains a readme which provides further information about the dataset, as well as an excel and csv copy of the data.",
