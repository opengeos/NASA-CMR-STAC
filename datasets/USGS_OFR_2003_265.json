    "description": "An experimental water release from the Glen Canyon Dam into the Colorado River\nabove Grand Canyon was conducted in September 2000 by the U.S. Bureau of\nReclamation. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted sidescan sonar surveys\nbetween Glen Canyon Dam (mile -15) and Diamond Creek (mile 220), Arizona (mile\ndesignations after Stevens, 1998) to determine the sediment characteristics of\nthe Colorado River bed before and after the release. The first survey\n(R3-00-GC, 28 Aug to 5 Sep 2000) was conducted before the release when the\nriver was at its Low Summer Steady Flow (LSSF) of 8,000 cfs. The second survey\n(R4-00-GC, 10 to 18 Sep 2000) was conducted immediately after the September\n2000 experimental release when the average daily flow was as high as 30,800 cfs\nas measured below Glen Canyon Dam (Figure 2). Riverbed sediment properties\ninterpreted from the sidescan sonar images include sediment type and sandwaves;\noverall changes in these properties between the two surveys were calculated.\n\nSidescan sonar data from the USGS surveys were processed for segments of the\nColorado River from Glen Canyon Dam (mile -15) to Phantom Ranch (mile 87.7,\nFigure 3). The surveys targeted pools between rapids that are part of the Grand\nCanyon Monitoring and Research Center (GCMRC http://www.gcmrc.gov/) physical\nsciences study.\n\nMaps interpreted from the sidescan sonar images show the distribution of\nsediment types (bedrock, boulders, pebbles or cobbles, and sand) and the extent\nof sandwaves for each of the pre- and post-flow surveys. The changes between\nthe two surveys were calculated with spatial arithmetric and had properties of\nfining, coarsening, erosion, deposition, and the appearance or disappearance of\nsandwaves.\n\nThis report describes GIS spatial data files for this project and provides\nexamples of the data from the Colorado River near mile 2 below the confluence\nof the Paria and Colorado Rivers. The complete data set includes sidescan sonar\nimages and interpreted map files for each of the pre- and post-flow surveys and\nthe changes between the segments of rivers.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
