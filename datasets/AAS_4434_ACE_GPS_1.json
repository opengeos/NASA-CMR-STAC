    "description": "Raw GPS and ship motion data collected during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition 2016/2017.\n    \nWaves in the Southern Ocean are the biggest on the planet. They exert extreme stresses on the coastline of the Sub-Antarctic Islands, which affects coastal morphology and the delicate natural environment that the coastline offers. In Antarctic waters, the sea ice cover reflects a large proportion of the wave energy, creating a complicated sea state close to the ice edge. The remaining proportion of the wave energy penetrates deep into the ice-covered ocean and breaks the ice into relatively small floes. Then, the waves herd the floes and cause them to collide and raft. \n \nThere is a lack of field data in the Sub-Antarctic and Antarctic Oceans. Thus, wave models are not well calibrated and perform poorly in these regions. Uncertainties relate to the difficulties to model the strong interactions between waves and currents (the Antarctic Circumpolar and tidal currents) and between waves and ice (reflected waves modify the incident field and ice floes affect transmission into the ice-covered ocean). Drawbacks in wave modelling undermine our understanding and ability to protect this delicate ocean and coastal environment.   \n \nBy installing a Wave and Surface Current Monitoring System (WaMoS II, a marine X-Band radar) on the research vessel Akademic Thresnikov and using the meteo-station and GPS on-board, this project has produced a large database of winds, waves and surface currents. Dara were collected during the Antarctic Circmumnavigaion Expedition, which took place from Dec. 2016 to Mar. 2017. The instrumentation operated in any weather and visibility conditions, and at night, monitoring the ocean continuously over the entire Circumnavigation.\n \nRecords can support  \n \n1. the assessment of metocean conditions in the Southern Oceans; and \n \n2. calibration and validation of wave and global circulation models. \n \nData - AAS_4434_ACE_GPS contains basic metereological conditions acquired form the ship\u2019s meteo-station, gepgraphical coordinates (latitude, longitude and altitude) from the ship\u2019s GPS and ship motion data from the ship\u2019s Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). These data are stored as time series with a sampling frequency of 1Hz.",
