    "description": "This dataset includes data from three vegetation surveys in a restored raised bog (Hagenmoos) in the lowland of the canton of Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland). The bog Hagenmoos was restored by cutting shrubs and trees within the formerly peat-cutting pits and by blocking drainages. The vegetation surveys were carried out before (1989), ten years after (1999) and 30 years after restoration (2020). In each vegetation survey, all vascular plant and bryophyte species within 72 permanent plots were recorded. Of these plots, 34 are located within the formerly peat-cutting pits and 38 are located outside the peat pits. Based on presence-absence data of vascular plants and bryophytes, mean ecological indicator and strategy values based on Landolt et al. (2010) were calculated and are provided in the Excel sheet. Indicator values for light, moisture, pH, nutrients, humus, temperature and continentality and strategy values for stress, competition and ruderality were considered. Furthermore, species richness for the following groups were calculated: (1) all plant species, (2) all vascular plant species, (3) bog specialists among vascular plant species, (4) all bryophyte species, (5) bog specialists among bryophyte species. As bog specialist species, we considered all plant species listed as characteristic species of raised bogs by Feldmeyer-Christe and K\u00fcchler (2018: Moore der Schweiz. Haupt, Bern).",
