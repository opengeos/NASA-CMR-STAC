    "description": "This report contains all of the available daily sulfur dioxide and carbon\ndioxide emission rates from Cook Inlet volcanoes as determined by the U.S. \nGeological Survey (USGS) from  March 1990 through July 1994.  Airborne sulfur\ndioxide gas sampling of the Cook Inlet volcanoes  (Redoubt, Spurr, Iliamna, and\nAugustine) began in 1986 when several measurements were carried out at\nAugustine volcano during the eruption of 1986.  Systematic monitoring for\nsulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide began in March 1990 at Redoubt volcano and\ncontinues to the present.   Intermittent measurements at Augustine and Iliamna\nvolcanoes began in 1990 and continues to the present.  Intermittent\nmeasurements began at Spurr volcano in 1991, and were continued at more regular\nintervals from June, 1992 through the 1992 eruption at the Crater Peak vent to\nthe present.",
