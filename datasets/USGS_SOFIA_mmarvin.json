    "description": "Methylmercury (MeHg) degradation was investigated along an eutrophication gradient in the Florida Everglades by quantifying 14CH4 and 14CO2 production after incubation of anaerobic sediments with 14C-MeHg. Degradation rate constants (k) were consistently <=0.1 per day, and decreased with sediment depth. Higher k values were observed when shorter incubation times and lower MeHg amendment levels were used, and k increased two-fold as in-situ MeHg concentrations were approached. The average floc layer k was 0.046 +/- 0.023/ d (n=17) for 1-2 day incubations. In-situ degradation rates were estimated to be 0.02 to 0.5 ng MeHg/g dry sed/d, increasing from eutrophied to pristine areas. Nitrate-respiring bacteria did not demethylate MeHg, and NO3- addition partially inhibited degradation in some cases. MeHg degradation rates were not affected by PO4-3 addition. 14CO2 production in all samples indicated that oxidative demethylation (OD) was an important degradation mechanism. OD occurred over five orders of magnitude of applied MeHg concentration, with lowest limits (1-18 ng MeHg/g dry sediment) in the range of in-situ MeHg levels. Sulfate reducers and methanogens were the primary agents of anaerobic OD, although it is suggested that methanogens dominate degradation at in-situ MeHg concentrations. Specific pathways of OD by these two microbial groups are proposed.\n\nThe objective of this research is to provide ecosystem managers with MeHg degradation rate data from a number of study sites that represent a diversity of hydrologic and nutrient regimes common to the Everglades, and to forge a better understanding of the microbial and geochemical controls regulating MeHg degradation in this system.",
