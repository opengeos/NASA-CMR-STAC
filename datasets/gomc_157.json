    "description": "While we have good information on the occurrence of amphibians and\nreptiles in the National Seashore, there is much we do not know about their\ndistribution, abundance, and population trends. Given the widespread declines\nin amphibians and reptiles that are being reported from many areas of the\nUnited States and beyond, this information is now more important than ever.\nProtected areas, such as Cape Cod National Seashore will be critical for many\nspecies survival. Fortunately, the National Seashore has recently increased its\nefforts to inventory and monitor its wildlife, and we are gaining a better\nunderstanding of the National Seashore's amphibians and reptiles. The following\ntable summarizes the current (through May 2005) state of knowledge regarding\nthe occurrence and distribution of amphibians and reptiles at Cape Cod National\nSeashore. It is based primarily on the observations of Irene Seipt, Kyle Jones,\nJohn Portnoy, Brett Still, Bob Prescott, Betsy Colburn, Joan Milam, and Jackie\nSones in the 1980's and 1990's, and Kelly Boland, James Borgmeyer, Bob Cook,\nStan Kot,, Peter Paton, Matthew Schult, Bradd Timm, Todd Tupper, and numerous\nothers in more recent years. Should you encounter any of the species discussed\nabove, or observe species in towns previously unrecorded, please take a\nphotograph and contact me at 50-487-3262 x 106 or Robert_Cook@NPS.GOV.\n\nSponsor: Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program",
