    "description": "In order to investigate the structure of phytoplankton communities, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton communities were measured at 11 stations from September 17 to 28, 2004 in the Southeastern Barents Sea. The concentrations of total microphytoplankton, and nano-picophytoplankton chlorophyll a were higher at surface than those of lower waters. Dominant phytoplankton were nano-picophytoplankton such as Phaeocystis sp., Dinobryon belgica. Phytoplankton communities were composed of diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophyceae, silicoflagellate, prasinophyceae and prymnesiophyceae and showed 23 taxa in surface. Except in station 3, the most abundant species was picophytoplankton in all station, but the second was variable. Phytoplankton Cell abundance ranged from minimum 5.5\u00d7105 cells \u2113-1 to maximum 1.8\u00d7106 cells \u2113-1.\n1) To investigate on biodiversity, species composition, abundance and dominant species of phytoplankton communities in the southeastern Barents Sea\r\n2) To study on taxonomic research and dominant species of phytoplankton communities for investigate on indicator species",
