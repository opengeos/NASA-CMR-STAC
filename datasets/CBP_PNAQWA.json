    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) implemented the National Water-Quality\nAssessment (NAWQA) Program to describe the status and trends in the quality of\nthe Nation's surface water and ground water and to provide scientific\nunderstanding of the natural and human-induced factors that affect water\nquality. In 1991, twenty study units were started. Additional study units began\nin 1994 and 1997. Data collection and analysis in each study unit follows\nnational guidelines for the NAWQA Program,  but also addresses the issues most\nimportant to that study unit. NAWQA is designed to produce a wealth of\nwater-quality information to assist policy makers and managers at the national,\nstate, and local levels in making more informed decisions.  In 1991, the\nPotomac River Basin study unit began planning assessment activities. The basin\nwas subdivided into eight subunits based on physiographic and geologic\ncharacteristics, which were determined to be the most influential natural\nfactors affecting water quality. Water-quality sampling began in 1992. The\nfirst high-intensity data-collection phase of the study unit spanned from 1993\nto 1995; much of the data collection focused on the Great Valley Carbonate,\nPiedmont, Triassic Lowlands, and Valley and Ridge subunits. Hundreds of\nwater-quality characteristics were measured in different media during this\ntime, including ground water, streamwater, streambed sediments, and aquatic\nbiological tissues. Fish communities and stream habitat also were sampled. In\naddition, spatial data such as geology, land use, hydrography, and other\nwatershed characteristics were compiled into a geographic information system\n(GIS) to support the assessment. After 1995 the project entered a period of\nless frequent sampling called the low-intensity phase.\n\nThis report presents data collected and compiled during the first\nhigh-intensity phase of the Potomac NAWQA study unit. Data are presented from\n138 ground-water wells and 125 stream sites. Ground-water measurements compiled\nin this report include chemical, physical, and water-level data. Streamwater\nmeasurements compiled include chemical, physical, streamflow, bed-sediment\ncontaminants, aquatic-tissue contaminants, fish community, and selected stream\nhabitat data. Quality-control chemical data are also presented. Basinwide and\nsite-specific spatial data compiled by the study unit are also distributed with\nthis report.\n\n\nThe study design and sampling methods developed for the Potomac NAWQA study\nunit are consistent with the national NAWQA guidelines (Gilliom and others,\n1995). The design permits an integrated assessment of conditions at local,\nregional, and national scales. For more information refer to the report,\n\"Design and Implementation of a Sampling Strategy for a Water-Quality\nAssessment of the Potomac River Basin\" (Gerhart and Brakebill, 1996). Sampling\nmethods and protocols for the NAWQA Program are documented in a series of\nguideline documents. Citations for these can be found in the Selected\nreferences section of this report.",
