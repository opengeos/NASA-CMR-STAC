    "description": "NARSTO_Texas_PM2.5_Sampling_and_Analysis_Study_1997-1998_ is the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) Texas Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 Sampling and Analysis Study: 1997-1998 Data. The data for this product was collected from March 11, 1997 to March 12, 1998. The City of Houston, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), and the Houston Regional Monitoring Network sponsored sampling and analysis of PM2.5 samples taken over the course of one year, from March 11, 1997 to March 12, 1998. Objectives of the study were to determine the levels and chemical composition of PM2.5 in Houston and other cities in Texas and to determine the background levels and chemical composition of PM2.5 transported into Houston. During the sampling effort, 24-hour PM2.5 mass measurements were acquired from 15 sites throughout the state of Texas, using DRI's MEDVOL particle samples. All of the Teflon filters were analyzed for mass by gravimetry and a selected subset of the Teflon and quartz fiber filters were subjected to full chemical analysis. These measurements were taken in anticipation of the U.S. EPA revising PM2.5 and PM10 NAAQS. These results could be used to establish background PM conditions and determine compliance with new PM standards. Various sampler configurations allow evaluation of data precision, accuracy, and validity. \r\n\r\nNARSTO, which has since disbanded, was a public/private partnership, whose membership spanned across government, utilities, industry, and academe throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The primary mission was to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant scientific research and assessment of tropospheric pollution behavior; activities provide input for science-based decision-making and determination of workable, efficient, and effective strategies for local and regional air-pollution management. Data products from local, regional, and international monitoring and research programs are still available.",
