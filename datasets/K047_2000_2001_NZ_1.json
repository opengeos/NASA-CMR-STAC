    "description": "Shallow coring of permafrost glacial sediments was completed of the Sirius Group at Allan Hills to provide stratigraphic cores for thickness and facies analysis and at Table Mountain for comparative age analysis by Be and N inventory of 3 different aged deposits (Sirius, Sirius regolith and debris flow). At Allan Hills, 2 holes and 8.2m of core were recovered in Trudge Valley. Coring did not reveal any new facies of the Sirius at Allan Hills. At Table Mountain, 6 holes and 18.67m of core were recovered revealing a new fluvial gravel facies of the Sirius. Two thermistor arrays were deployed in different polygonal ground and set to record temperature at 12cm intervals to 2m depth, 4 times a day for 11 months.  In addition, a series of shallow (2m) cores were taken from a grid pattern of drilling around the Dry Valleys Drill Project (DVDP-6) hole near Lake Vida to assess the degree of contamination of diesel drilling fluid around this core (drilled in 1972).  Nine holes and 15.9m of core were recovered. The DVDP-6 hole was relocated to assess its current status, cased to a depth of 12m and capped.",
