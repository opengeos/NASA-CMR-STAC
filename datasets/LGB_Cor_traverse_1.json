    "description": "The Lambert Glacier Basin (LGB) series of five oversnow traverses were conducted from 1989-95. Several shallow depth ice cores (15-60 m) were drilled at selected sites along 2014 km of the main traverse track from LGB00 (68.6543 S, 61.1201 E) near Mawson Station to LGB72 (69.9209 S,76.4933 E) near Davis Station, and at selected sites along a western traverse line from LGB00 toward Enderby Land.\n\nIce cores have been kept in cool storage at a local cold room storage facility. Data from the cores (density, stratigraphy, granularity, conductivity, ....) have been saved in various spreadsheet files (mainly MS Excel).\n\nSummary data can be obtained from CRC Research Note No.09 'Surface mass balance and snow surface properties from the LambertGlacier Basin Traverses 1990-94'.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 3 and 2216.\n\nSome of this data have been stored in a very old format.  The majority of files have been updated to current formats, but some files (kaleidograph files in particular) were not able to be modified due to a lack of appropriate software.  However, these files are simply figures, and can be regenerated from the raw data (also provided).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nLatitude\nLongitude\nHeight\nCane\nDistance\nElevation\nDensity\nMass Accumulation\nYear\nDelta Oxygen-18\nGrain Size\nIce Crusts\nDepth Hoar",
