Describe the CONDITION of important elements of a system;\n2. Show the extent of the major PRESSUREs exerted on a system;\n3. Determine RESPONSE to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.\n\nThis indicator is one of: RESPONSE\n\nRATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION\nThe resources committed to heritage management are a measurable indicator of Governmental commitment to heritage issues.\n\nAustralia's human, or cultural, Antarctic heritage includes significant and fundamental activities, sites, buildings, stories and artefacts from the entire 20th Century, ranging from ground-breaking exploration and research to comparatively mundane aspects of day-to-day expedition life.  This Antarctic heritage is of significance to Australia, and, particularly in respect to the first half of the 20th Century, to the rest of the world.  As the natural elements and the passage of time disperse or destroy those aspects of heritage that are not traced, recorded or curated, the importance of intervention through a heritage management program increases yearly.\n\nDESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM\nSpatial scale: For the Australian Antarctic Territory, the whole of Antarctica, and the Territory of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands\n\nFrequency: Annual reports\n\nMeasurement technique: The AAD's Environmental Management and Audit Unit would collate information for this indicator.\n\nBudget Parent and Child accounts in the AAD's resource management system will be structured to allow immediate tracking of resources to individual heritage program sub-units.\n\nRESEARCH ISSUES\n\n\nLINKS TO OTHER INDICATORS\nResource allocation for area management and protection",
