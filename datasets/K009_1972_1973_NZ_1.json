    "description": "A geochemical reconnaisance of the salts in the Victoria Valley was undertaken in the 1972/73 season. A field camp was set up at Lake Vida and the area from Lake Vida to Lake Vaska, Lake Clarke and up the mountains to the north of Lake Vida were surveyed. Samples of salts were collected where they were visible and a number of soils were collected in closed drainage basins and at the edges of small lakes. A total of 2m of sediments 10m above the lake level were described and calcium carbonate 'biscuit' concretions were collected for 14C and/or U-Th dating.",
