    "description": "The data is regional and part of the High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 3 Collated (L3C) dataset covering the America Region (AMERICAS) based on retrievals from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16).  The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) is producing SST products in near real time from GOES-16 in the Eastern position. GOES-16 Imager level 1 data are acquired at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. The new GOES-East platform (GOES-16) enables daytime SST calculations (whereas, previously, GOES East SST was restricted to nighttime conditions). The GOES-16 SST is derived from three-bands (centered at 8.4, 10.3, and 12.3 um) algorithm. The ABI split-window configuration features three bands instead of the two found in heritage sensors. This offers additional potential but also may present a challenge if the two end bands centered at 10.3 and 12.3 um are pushed too far in the absorption lines. The 8.5-um is used in conjunction with the 10.3-um and 12.3-um bands for improved thin cirrus detection as well as for better atmospheric moisture correction in relatively dry atmospheres.  Atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from a numerical weather prediction model, together with a radiative transfer model, are used to correct the multispectral algorithm for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions. Each 30-minute observation interval is processed at full satellite resolution. The operational products are then produced by remapping over a 0.05-degree regular grid (60S-60N and 135W-15W) SST fields obtained by aggregating 30-minute SST data available in one-hour time, and the priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour. The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2.",
