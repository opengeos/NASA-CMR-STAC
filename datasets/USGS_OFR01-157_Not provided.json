    "description": "Beginning in 1995, the USGS, in cooperation with the U.S Army Corps of\nEngineers (USACE), New York District, began a program to generate\nreconnaissance maps of the sea floor offshore of the New York-New\nJersey metropolitan area, one of the most populated coastal regions of\nthe United States. The goal of this mapping program is to provide a\nregional synthesis of the sea-floor environment, including a\ndescription of sedimentary environments, sediment texture, seafloor\nmorphology, and geologic history to aid in understanding the impacts\nof anthropogenic activities, such as ocean dumping. This mapping\neffort differs from previous studies of this area by obtaining\ndigital, sidescan sonar images that cover 100 percent of the sea\nfloor.  This investigation was motivated by the need to develop an\nenvironmentally acceptable solution for the disposal of dredged\nmaterial from the New York - New Jersey Port, by the need to identify\npotential sources of sand for renourishment of the southern shore of\nLong island, and by the opportunity to develop a better understanding\nof the transport and long-term fate of contaminants by investigations\nof the present distribution of materials discharged into the New York\nBight over the last 100+ years (Schwab and others, 1997).\n\nThis DVD-ROM contains copies of the navigation and field Water Gun\nsubbottom data collected aboard the R/V Seaward Explorer, from 7-25\nMay, 1995.  The coverage is in the New York Bight area. This DVD-ROM\n(Digital Versatile Disc-Read Only Memory) has been produced in\naccordance with the UDF (Universal Disc Format) DVD-ROM Standard (ISO\n9660 equivalent) and is therefore capable of being read on any\ncomputing platform that has appropriate DVD-ROM driver software\ninstalled.  Access to the data and information contained on this\nDVD-ROM was developed using the HyperText Markup Language (HTML)\nutilized by the World Wide Web (WWW) project. Development of the\nDVD-ROM documentation and user interface in HTML allows a user to\naccess the information by using a variety of WWW information browsers\nto facilitate browsing and locating information and data. To access\nthe information contained on this disk with a WWW client browser, open\nthe file'index.htm' at the top level directory of this DVD-ROM with\nyour selected browser. The HTML documentation is written utilizing\nsome HTML 4.0 enhancements. The disk should be viewable by all WWW\nbrowsers but may not properly format on some older WWW browsers. Also,\nsome links to USGS collaborators and other agencies are available on\nthis DVD-ROM.  These links are only accessible if access to the\nInternet is available during browsing of the DVD-ROM.",
