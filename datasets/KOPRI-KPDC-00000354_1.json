    "description": "Atmospheric and oceanic carbon monoxide in the marine boundary layer was monitored from July 14 to July 29 by LGR and RGA along the cruise track of R/V Araon from Incheon to Nome(Alaska) carrying out a series of expeditions in the Northwest Pacific. The air inlet to the instrument was located at 29 m asl and the sea water inlet was located at 7m depth. CO was measured every 45 minutes\nAtmospheric carbon monoxide plays a key role in tropospheric chemistry in particular related to the oxidation capacity and to understanding the chemical processes in the marine boundary layer. Also underway continuous measurement of CO enables us to estimate marine emission of CO in global scale.",
