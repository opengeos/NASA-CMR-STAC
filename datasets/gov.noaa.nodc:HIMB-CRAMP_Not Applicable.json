    "description": "This collection consists of Hawaii Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) surveys and include quantitative estimates of substrate type, rugosity, species type, and percent coverage. Digital still images from transects are also included. The data sets consist of image files (JPEG) of digital still photographs and spreadsheets (XLS with exported redundant CSV copies).\n\nCRAMP was created during 1997-98 by leading coral reef researchers, managers and educators in Hawaii. The initial task was to develop a statewide network consisting of over 30 long-term coral reef monitoring sites and an associated database. Upon completion of the monitoring network the focus was expanded to include rapid quantitative assessments and habitat mapping on a statewide spatial scale. Today the emphasis is on using these tools to understand the ecology of Hawaiian coral reefs in relation to other geographic areas.\n\nCRAMP study sites, including all areas of concern designated by the State of Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR), were selected from throughout the State of Hawaii based on information provided by a wide spectrum of managers, scientists, and educators. These sites represent a full range of reef habitats subjected to various degrees of anthropogenic influences ranging from severely impacted to relatively pristine sites held in conservation status.  The West Hawaii Aquarium Project has augmented CRAMP with surveys of fish at CRAMP sites on the west side of the Island of Hawaii.\n\nThe purpose is to understand the ecology of Hawaiian coral reefs in relation to other geographic areas and to monitor change at each given site.  The CRAMP experimental design allows detection of changes that can be attributed to various factors such as:  overuse (over-fishing, anchor damage, aquarium trade collection, etc.), sedimentation, nutrient loading,  catastrophic natural events (storm wave impact, lava  flows), coastal construction, urbanization, global warming  (bleaching), introduced species, algal invasions, and fish  and invertebrate diseases.",
