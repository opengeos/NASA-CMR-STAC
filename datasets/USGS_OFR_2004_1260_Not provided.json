    "description": "Coal-bed methane exploration and production have begun within the Tongue River\nwatershed in southeastern Montana. The development of coal-bed methane requires\nproduction of large volumes of ground water, some of which may be discharged to\nstreams, potentially increasing stream discharge and sediment load. Changes in\nstream discharge or sediment load may result in changes to channel morphology\nthrough changes in erosion and vegetation. These changes might be subtle and\ndifficult to detect without baseline data that indicate stream-channel\nconditions before extensive coal-bed methane development began. In order to\nprovide this baseline channel-morphology data, the U.S. Geological Survey, in\ncooperation with the Bureau of Land Management, collected channel-morphology\ndata in 2001-02 to document baseline conditions for several reaches along the\nTongue River and selected tributaries.\n\nThis report presents channel-morphology data for five sites on the mainstem\nTongue River and four sites on its tributaries. Bankfull, water-surface, and\nthalweg elevations, channel sections, and streambed-particle sizes were\nmeasured along reaches near streamflow-gaging stations. At each site, the\nchannel was classified using methods described by Rosgen. For six sites,\nbankfull discharge was determined from the stage- discharge relation at the\ngage for the stage corresponding to the bankfull elevation. For three sites,\nthe step-backwater computer model HEC-RAS was used to estimate bankfull\ndischarge. Recurrence intervals for the bankfull discharge also were estimated\nfor eight of the nine sites. Channel-morphology data for each site are\npresented in maps, tables, graphs, and photographs.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
