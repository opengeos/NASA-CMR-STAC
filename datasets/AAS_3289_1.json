    "description": "Two samples were collected at Cape Denison (Permit no. ATEP 10-11-3289), both by Dr David Tingay (2010 - 2011 Mawson's Huts Foundation Expedition). Both samples were cleaned with water prior to RTA and cleared in Hobart by AQIS (permit attached)\n\nThe first was a sample of the Cape Denison Orthogneiss (GA sample_no 2122491; Lat 67.008 S; long 142.655E). The sample was taken from loose material on the surface on the west side of Memorial Hill out of sight of Mawson's Hut. The location of the sample site is shown in the attached image. \n\nThe second was a sample of the Cape Denison Amphibolite (GA sample_no 2122492; Lat 67.008 S; long 142.657E). The sample was taken from loose material adjacent to Granholm Hut (see attached image). \n\nThe results appears in a brief format in AusGeo News (a GA publication) for the 100th AAE celebrations (AusGeo News 104 'Dec 2011' can downloaded at http://www.ga.gov.au/ausgeonews/download.jsp ). Also SHRIMP results are discussed in the Cape Denison Map (available at https://www.ga.gov.au/products/servlet/controller?event=GEOCAT_DETAILS&catno=72710 ). \n\nBoth rock types are approved Geoscience Australia lithological names\n\nThe sample sites are shown in the attached images\n\nRock samples are stored at Geoscience Australia.",
