    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L3 Binned Cloud Liquid Water Path of water cloud by reflection method (16days,1/4deg) is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km.  This product is cloud liquid water path of water cloud by reflection method. Undesirable radiation components such as ground-reflected solar radiation and thermal radiation are guessed from satellite-received radiances in channels 13, 30 and 35 of GLI and subtracted from radiances in channels 13 and 30 to derive the reflected solar radiation of a cloud layer which includes information about cloud microphysical properties. This method can be applied to a broad range of water clouds from semi-transparent to thick clouds. This product includes sum, square sum, max, min of each pixel is included.The provided format is HDF. The physical quantity unit is g/m^2. The spatial resolution is 1/4 degree and the statistical period is 16 days, also 1month statistics is available. Map projection is EQR. The generation unit is global. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
