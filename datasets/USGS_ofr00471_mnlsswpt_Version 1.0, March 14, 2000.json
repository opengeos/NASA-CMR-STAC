    "description": "Data on wells and test holes in this data set were used to identify elevations\nfor the top of the Minnelusa Formation for the creation of a structure-contour\nmap. This data set was created as part of the Black Hills Hydrology Study\n(BHHS). The BHHS is a long-term investigation that was initiated in 1990 as a\ncooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the South Dakota\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the West Dakota\nWater Development District. West Dakota represents various local and county\ncooperators. The purpose of the study is to assess the quantity, quality, and\ndistribution of surface and ground water in the Black Hills area of western\nSouth Dakota (Driscoll, 1992). The study area includes parts of Butte, Custer,\nFall River, Lawrence, Meade, and Pennington counties in South Dakota.\n\nThis dataset describes wells and test holes completed in the Minnelusa\nFormation that were used to create the structure-contours for the top of the\nMinnelusa Formation, Black Hills, South Dakota. \n\nWell construction, well location, and related data were retrieved from drilling\nrecords kept on file in the Rapid City, South Dakota, U.S. Geological Survey\noffice. Wells were eliminated from the list if no geologic log was available.\nValues of latitude, longitude, and elevations of formation tops for wells were\nused as input to ARC/INFO to create a point coverage of these wells.",
