    "description": "This database and accompanying plot files depict the distribution of geologic\nmaterials and structures at a regional (1:24,000) scale.  The report is\nintended to provide geologic information for the regional study of materials\nproperties, earthquake shaking, landslide potential, mineral hazards, mineral\nand energy resources, seismic velocity, and earthquake faults.  In addition,\nthe report contains new information and interpretations about the regional\ngeologic history and framework.  However, the regional scale of this report\ndoes not provide sufficient detail for site development purposes.  In addition,\nthis map does not take the place of fault-rupture hazard zones designated by\nthe California State Geologist (Hart and Bryant, 1997). Similarly, the database\ncannot be substituted for comprehensive maps that systematically identify and\nclassify landslide hazards.\n\nThis digital map database, compiled from previously published and unpublished\ndata, and new mapping by the authors, represents the general distribution of\nbedrock and surficial deposits in the mapped area.  Together with the\naccompanying text file (srm_expl.txt, srm_expl.pdf), it provides current\ninformation on the geologic structure and stratigraphy of the area covered. \nThe database delineates map units that are identified by general age and\nlithology following the stratigraphic nomenclature of the U.S. Geological\nSurvey.  The scale of the source maps limits the spatial resolution (scale) of\nthe database to 1:24,000 or smaller.\n\nThe databases in this report were compiled in ARC/INFO, a commercial Geographic\nInformation System (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands,\nCalifornia), with version 3.0 of the menu interface ALACARTE (Fitzgibbon and\nWentworth, 1991, Fitzgibbon, 1991, Wentworth and Fitzgibbon, 1991).  The files\nare COVERAGE (ARC/INFO vector data) format.  Coverages are stored in\nuncompressed ARC export format (ARC/INFO version 8.0.  2).  ARC/INFO export\nfiles (files with the .e00 extension) can be converted into ARC/INFO coverages\nin ARC/INFO (see below) and can be read by some other Geographic Information\nSystems, such as MapInfo via ArcLink and ESRI's ArcView (version 1.0 for\nWindows 3.1 to 3.11 is available for free from ESRI's web site:\nhttp://www.esri.com.) The digital compilation was done in version 7.2.1 of\nARC/INFO with version 3.0 of the menu interface ALACARTE (Fitzgibbon and\nWentworth, 1991, Fitzgibbon, 1991, Wentworth and Fitzgibbon, 1991).  The\ngeologic map information was digitized from stable originals of the geologic\nmaps at 1:24,000 scale.  The author manuscripts (pen on mylar) were scanned\nusing a Altek monochrome scanner with a resolution of 800 dots per inch.  The\nscanned images were vectorized and transformed from scanner coordinates to\nprojection coordinates with digital tics placed by hand at quadrangle corners. \nThe scanned lines were edited interactively by hand using ALACARTE, color\nboundaries were tagged as appropriate, and some scanning artifacts visible at\n1:24,000 were removed.\n\nThis report consists of a set of geologic map database files (Arc/Info\ncoverages) and supporting text and plotfiles.  In addition, the report includes\ntwo sets of plotfiles (PostScript and PDF format) that will generate map sheets\nand pamphlets similar to a traditional USGS Open-File Report.  These files are\ndescribed in the explanatory pamphlets (srm.ps, srm.pdf, and srm.txt).  The\nbase map layers used in the preparation of the geologic map plotfiles were\nscanned from a scale-stable version of the USGS 1:24,000 topographic maps of\nthe San Rafael Mtn. (1959, photorevised 1988) 7.5-minute quadrangle. The map\nhas a 40 foot contour interval.",
