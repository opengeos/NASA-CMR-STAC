    "description": "This data set was created for a project to develop data sets to support\nground-water vulnerability analysis. The objective was to create and document a\ndigital geospatial data set from a published report or map, or existing digital\ngeospatial data sets that could be used in ground-water vulnerability analysis.\n\nThis data set consists of digitized aquifer boundaries of the Antlers aquifer\nin southeastern Oklahoma. The Early Cretaceous-age Antlers Sandstone is an\nimportant source of water in an area that underlies about 4,400-square miles of\nall or part of Atoka, Bryan, Carter, Choctaw, Johnston, Love, Marshall,\nMcCurtain, and Pushmataha Counties. The Antlers aquifer consists of sand, clay,\nconglomerate, and limestone in the outcrop area. The upper part of the Antlers\naquifer consists of beds of sand, poorly cemented sandstone, sandy shale, silt,\nand clay. The Antlers aquifer is unconfined where it outcrops in about an\n1,800-square-mile area.\n\nThe data set includes the outcrop area of the Antlers Sandstone in Oklahoma and\nareas where the Antlers is overlain by alluvial and terrace deposits and a few\nsmall thin outcrops of the Goodland Limestone. Most of the aquifer boundary\nlines were extracted from published digital geology data sets. Some of the\nlines were interpolated in areas where the Antlers aquifer is overlain by\nalluvial and terrace deposits near streams and rivers. The interpolated lines\nare very similar to the aquifer boundaries published in a ground-water modeling\nreport for the Antlers aquifer. The maps from which this data set was derived\nwere scanned or digitized from maps published at a scale of 1:250,000.\n\nThis data set is one of four digital map data sets being published together for\nthis aquifer. The four data sets are:\n\n  aqbound -  aquifer boundaries\n  cond    -  hydraulic conductivity\n  recharg -  aquifer recharge\n  wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours",
