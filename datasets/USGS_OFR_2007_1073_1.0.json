    "description": "The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) summary presents seismic data gathered\nduring the year. The seismic summary is offered without interpretation as a\nsource of preliminary data. It is complete in the sense that most data for\nevents of M&#8805;1.5 routinely gathered by the Observatory are included.\n\nThe HVO summaries have been published in various forms since 1956. Summaries\nprior to 1974 were issued quarterly, but cost, convenience of preparation and\ndistribution, and the large quantities of data dictated an annual publication\nbeginning with Summary 74 for the year 1974. Summary 86 (the introduction of\nCUSP at HVO) includes a description of the seismic instrumentation,\ncalibration, and processing used in recent years. Beginning with 2004,\nsummaries are simply identified by the year, rather than Summary number. The\npresent summary includes background information on the seismic network and\nprocessing to allow use of the data and to provide an understanding of how they\nwere gathered.\n\nA report by Klein and Koyanagi (1980) tabulates instrumentation, calibration,\nand recording history of each seismic station in the network. It is designed as\na reference for users of seismograms and phase data and includes and augments\nthe information in the station table in this summary. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
