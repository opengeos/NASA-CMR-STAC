    "description": "Data on glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) concentrations over time at different depths in a sandy soil from Macquarie Island.\n    \nThere are 2 files providing data on residual glyphosate and its derivative aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) concentrations remaining in soil over time at different depths in a common sandy soil from Macquarie Island.  These data result from a leaching experiment using 20 cm deep soil columns collected from MI and returned to the University of New England for testing.  Glyphosate was applied to the surface of the columns at the recommended rate of 1.5 kg/ha and then the columns were leached with water simulating MI rainfall, and over a period of 48 weeks individual columns were subsampled on several occasions at 4 depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm) for glyphosate and AMPA to determine potential for herbicide residues of glyphosate on MI. The first file provides summary statistics of the results while the second file contains the raw data for all replicates and the controls. More detailed methods are provided in the PhD thesis of Laura Williams (University of New England, 2016). Laura analysed the leachates from these columns in a previous project (4158) while residue analysis was undertaken in this project by PhD student Kirsten Drew.\n\nSoils (100 intact cores (60 mm diameter x 200 mm) from a range of field sites infested with S. media \u2013 GPS referenced) collected from MI and returned to UNE. A replicated, multi-factorial incubation trial conducted in the sub-Antarctic growth chamber to investigate the interactive effects of soil type, herbicide type and incubation period on herbicide fate.",
