    "description": "Samples were collected between 1998 and 1992 on Macquarie Island from existing water bodies and from exposed lake sediments up to 14,000 years old. The dataset comprises a taxa list of 131 non-marine diatoms, water quality (pH and conductivity) in nine lakes, and a presence absence table of species by lake.\n\nThe lists show freshwater diatom taxa observed in Macquarie Island lakes based on samples of lake sediments, rock scrapings and macrophytes. At least 300 diatom valves were identified on each sample.  The results were reported in the references given below. \n\nAinsworth Lake (situated on the plateau at the southern end of Macquarie Island). The taxa list is derived from 8 samples collected between Oct 1988 and Dec 1992.\n\nBrothers Lake (situated on the eastern edge of the Macquarie Island plateau). The taxa list is derived from 10 samples collected between Oct 1988 and Dec 1992.\n\nDuck Lagoon (situated on the western coastal plain of Macquarie Island). The taxa list is derived from 15 samples collected between 1988-90.\n\nGreen Gorge Tarn (situated on the eastern coastal plain of Macquarie Island). The taxa list is derived from 8 samples collected between Oct 1988 and Dec 1992.\n\nMajor Lake (situated on the plateau of Macquarie Island). The taxa list is derived from 9 samples collected between Oct 1988 and Dec 1992.\n\nPalaeolake Skua (formerly located on the western edge of the Macquarie Island plateau covering the site of the present smaller Skua Lake.  The basal layer of exposed lake sediments is about 13,000 years old). The taxa list is from 32 samples regularly spaced vertically along the exposed sediments.\n\nPyramid Lake (situated on the plateau of Macquarie Island). The diatom taxa list is derived from 5 samples collected between Oct 1988 and Dec 1992.\n\nSkua Lake (situated on the western margin of the Macquarie Island plateau). The taxa list is derived from 8 samples collected between 1988-89.\n\nSquare Lake  (situated on the plateau of the island). The taxa list is derived from 6 samples collected between 1990-92.\n\nTulloch Lake (situated on the plateau of Macquarie Island). The taxa list is derived from 10 samples collected between Oct 1988 and Dec 1992.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nSpecies\nph\nconductivity\nLake\nPresence\nAbsence",
