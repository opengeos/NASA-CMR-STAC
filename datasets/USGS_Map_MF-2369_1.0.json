    "description": "This map was funded by and is a product of the National Cooperative Geologic\nMapping Program.  This corridor is experiencing rapid urban growth.  Geologic\nmapping is needed to aid in land development planning in order to address,\navoid, or mitigate known and potential geologic hazards.\n\nThis new 1:24,000-scale geologic map of the Vail West 7.5' quadrangle, as part\nof the USGS Western Colorado I-70 Corridor Cooperative Geologic Mapping\nProject, provides new interpretations of the stratigraphy, structure, and\ngeologic hazards in the area on the southwest flank of the Gore Range.\n\nBedrock strata include Miocene tuffaceous sedimentary rocks, Mesozoic and upper\nPaleozoic sedimentary rocks, and undivided Early(?) Proterozoic metasedimentary\nand igneous rocks.  Tuffaceous rocks are found in fault-tilted blocks.  Only\nsmall outliers of the Dakota Sandstone, Morrison Formation, Entrada Sandstone,\nand Chinle Formation exist above the redbeds of the Permian-Pennsylvanian\nMaroon Formation and Pennsylvanian Minturn Formation, which were derived during\nerosion of the Ancestral Front Range east of the Gore fault zone.  In the\nsouthwestern area of the map, the proximal Minturn facies change to distal\nEagle Valley Formation and the Eagle Valley Evaporite basin facies.  The Jacque\nMountain Limestone Member, previously defined as the top of the Minturn\nFormation, cannot be traced to the facies change to the southwest.  Abundant\nsurficial deposits include Pinedale and Bull Lake Tills, periglacial deposits,\nearth-flow deposits, common diamicton deposits, common Quaternary landslide\ndeposits, and an extensive, possibly late Pliocene landslide deposit. \nLandscaping has so extensively modified the land surface in the town of Vail\nthat a modified land-surface unit was created to represent the surface unit.\n\nLaramide movement renewed activity along the Gore fault zone, producing a\nseries of northwest-trending open anticlines and synclines in Paleozoic and\nMesozoic strata, parallel to the trend of the fault zone.  Tertiary\ndown-to-the-northeast normal faults are evident and are parallel to similar\nfaults in both the Gore Range and the Blue River valley to the northeast;\npresumably these are related to extensional deformation that occurred during\nformation of the northern end of the Rio Grande rift system in Colorado.\n\nIn the southwestern part of the map area, a diapiric(?) exposure of the Eagle\nValley Evaporite exists and chaotic faults and folds suggest extensive\ndissolution and collapse of overlying bedrock, indicating the presence of a\ngeologic hazard.  Quaternary landslides are common and indicate that landslide\nhazards are widespread in the area, particularly where old slide deposits are\ndisturbed by construction. The late Pliocene(?) landslide that consists largely\nof a smectitic upper Morrison Formation matrix and boulders of Dakota Sandstone\nis readily reactivated.  Debris flows are likely to invade low-standing areas\nwithin the towns of Vail and West Vail where tributaries of Gore Creek issue\nfrom the mountains on the north side of the valley.\n\nDATASETS INCLUDED IN THIS GEOSPATIAL DATABASE:\n  > vwpoly: geologic polygons, contacts, faults, marker beds, and\n    intra-unit scarps\n  > vwline: fold axes, concealed linear features, limits of abundant\n    chert fragments in the Maroon Formation, and cross-section lines\n  > vwpoint: bedding and foliation attitudes, and miscellaneous point data",
