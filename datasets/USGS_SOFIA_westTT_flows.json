    "description": "The objectives of this study are: 1. To develop flow calculation techniques for bridges and culverts under US-41, between Carnestown and County Road 92. First year focusing on the section between Faka-Union Canal and County Road 92, expanding east to State Road 29 in the second year of the study. 2. To provide support to on-going CERP and DOI studies populating hydrologic databases that can also be used by other federal and state agencies, universities, and local institutions conducting studies in the area.\n\nThe coastal environment of south Florida has shown signs of ecological deterioration that is attributed to changes in freshwater inflows due to urban development, water management practices, and corresponding increases of salinity and nutrient content in estuarine waters. With plans to improve water levels and historic flow-ways in the Picayune Strand (formerly known as Southern Golden Gate Estates) area north of Tamiami Trail to more natural conditions, changes are expected in the amount, timing, and distribution of freshwater discharge through bridges and culverts under US-41, altering current conditions in the wetlands and estuaries to the south. Hydrologic information throughout the Ten Thousand Islands and adjacent ecosystems is critical to the development of restoration strategies and for the evaluation of restoration results. With the implementation of the CERP projects \"Picayune Strand Hydrologic Restoration project\" (PSRP) and \"Tamiami Trail (US-41) Culvert project\", there is a need to determine current hydrologic conditions in areas south of US-41. These areas will be greatly impacted by these projects currently underway. There is little hydrologic information throughout the wetlands and estuaries within the study area that could be used in the development and calibration of the hydrologic models. There is a critical need for information on freshwater flows across the Trail, ground-water information (including Specific Conductance/salinity) within the marshes south of the Trail, flows at or near the mouth of tributaries, water level, and salinity data throughout the area. The results of this study will provide information that currently does not exist on freshwater flows and salinity trends, effects of weather systems on flow patterns, and on how PSRP and Tamiami Trail Culverts restoration projects affect freshwater inflows and water quality of the estuarine ecosystem within the Ten Thousand Islands area.",
