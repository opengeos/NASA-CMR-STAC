    "description": "This data set was created for use in a regional ground-water model of the Lake\nTexoma watershed for a project by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\nNational Risk Management Research Laboratory located in Ada, Oklahoma, titled\n\"Development of protocols and decision support tools for assessing watershed\nsystem assimilative capacity, in support of risked-based ecosystem management\nand restoration practices.\"\n\nAlthough this data set was created for use in a specific project, it may be\nused to make geologic maps, and determine approximate areas and locations of\nvarious geologic units.\n\nThis digital data set contains geologic formations for the 1:250,000-scale\nSherman quadrangle, Texas and Oklahoma. The original data are from the Bureau\nof Economic Geology publication, \"Geologic Atlas of Texas, Sherman sheet\", by\nJ.H. McGowen, T.F. Hentz, D.E. Owen, M.K. Pieper, C.A. Shelby, and V.E. Barnes,\n1967, revised 1991.\n\nAdditional geology data sets are available for Oklahoma at URL\n\"http://ok.water.usgs.gov/gis/geology/index.html\". The source maps for three\ncounties in the Oklahoma panhandle are at a scale of 1:125,000. The source maps\nfor the rest of Oklahoma are at a scale of 1:250,000.\n\nThe original geology source map was published in the Transverse Mercator\nProjection, Zone 14. This data set was projected to an Albers Equal Area\nprojection (Synder, 1987), cast on the North American Datum of 1983.\n\nThis electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that applies\nto all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers were asked to check the\ntopological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics,\nprojection, and geographic extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and\npaper plots for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and\nattributes. The reviewers were asked to check the metadata and accompanying\nfiles for completeness and accuracy.",
