The spreadsheet contains three worksheets:\n\n - a summary of the data\n - validated data\n - all data\n\nPublic\nThe experimental krill research program is focussed on obtaining life history information of use in managing the krill fishery - the largest Antarctic fishery. In particular, the program will concentrate on studies into schooling, growth, ageing, behaviour and reproduction of krill as well as into the operation, behaviour and trends of the krill fishery.\n\nProject objectives:\nTo investigate key aspects of the biology of Antarctic krill and its management utilising the facilities at the Australian Antarctic Division. \n\nTaken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:\nProgress against objectives:\nWe succeeded to take krill larvae reproduced in-house last year up to adult stage (external maturity) for the first time in our research laboratory (the second facility ever outside Antarctica), which means that last year's larvae reached maturity within a year in our aquarium, compared to 2-3 years in the wild, however spawning from this population is yet to be recorded. We also had successful reproduction this year and currently these animals are at late larval stage. We have now succeeded in reproduction two years in a row and have established the technique. This is a major step forward in closing Antarctic krill's life cycle in our aquarium. This achievement makes us the only research facility outside Antarctica to be able to conduct live krill experiments for the entire life stage and contribute information on biological parameters important for krill management.\n\nTaken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:\nProgress against objectives:\nThis year for the first time we have succeeded in closing the entire krill life cycle in our research laboratory (the second facility ever outside Antarctica. We also achieved successful reproduction this year and currently these animals are at the late larval stage. We have now succeeded in krill reproduction for three years in a row and have firmly established the technique. This achievement makes us the only research facility outside Antarctica to be able to conduct live krill experiments for the entire life stage and contribute information on biological parameters important for krill management.\n\nTaken from the 2010-2011 Progress Report:\nPublic summary of the season progress:\nUnderstanding how krill may respond to various environments is the fundamental information to predict the future of krill centric ecosystem under the climate change. The project's current focus is to study impacts of ocean acidification on krill. The AAD aquarium facility for ocean acidification study is continuing to be upgraded to increase its capacity and stability to undertake its experiments at larger scale. Negative impacts of ocean acidification on krill has been investigated and the range of CO2 level fatal to krill embryonic development was broadly identified, and was published for the first time.",
