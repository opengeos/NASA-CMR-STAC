    "description": "In 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey Landslide Hazards Program provided funding\nfor seven State geological surveys to report on the status of landslide\ninvestigation strategies in each of their States, and to suggest improved ways\nto approach the tracking of landslides, their effects, losses associated with\nthe landslides, and hazard mitigation strategies. Each State was to provide a\ndraft report suggesting innovative ways to track landslides, and to participate\nin subsequent workshops. A workshop was convened in June 2003 in Lincoln, Neb.,\nto discuss the results and future strategies on how best to incorporate the\nseven pilot projects into one methodology that all of the 50 States could\nadopt. The seven individual reports produced by the State surveys are published\nhere to put forth a forum for discussion of the varying methods of tracking\nlandslides.\n\nThis pilot study, conducted by seven State geological surveys, examines the\nfeasibility of collecting accurate and reliable information on economic losses\nassociated with landslides. Each State survey examined the availability,\ndistribution, and inherent uncertainties of economic loss data in their study\nareas. Their results provide the basis for identifying the most fruitful\nmethods of collecting landslide loss data nationally, using methods that are\nconsistent and provide common goals. These results can enhance and establish\nthe future directions of scientific investigation priorities by convincingly\ndocumenting landslide risks and consequences that are universal throughout the\n50 States. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
