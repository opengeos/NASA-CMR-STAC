    "description": "The ANTARES regional network is composed of coastal time-series stations located around Latin America. The main goal is to study long-term changes due to both climate and anthropogenic effects, as well as for ocean color purposes of satellite match-ups and algorithm development. The Ubatuba-ANTARES station is located in the Southeast Brazilian Bight, 12 nautical miles from the coastline, at approximately 40 m depth. Ubatuba inner shelf is influenced by mesoscale cyclonic meandering of the Brazil Current system at a region with a crosscurrent transfer of slope waters into the shelf. This ecosystem is mainly oligo-mesotrophic, but also strongly influenced by the South Atlantic Central Water upwelled locally or remotely forced from northeastern upwelling cores mainly during austral summer. In the winter, colder, less saline and relatively richer waters from southern latitudes advect northwards along the shelf.",
