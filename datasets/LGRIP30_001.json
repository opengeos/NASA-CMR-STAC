    "description": "The Landsat-Derived Global Rainfed and Irrigated-Cropland Product (LGRIP) provides high resolution, global cropland data to assist and address food and water security issues of the twenty-first century.  As an extension of the Global Food Security-support Analysis Data (GFSAD) project, LGRIP maps the world\u2019s agricultural lands by dividing them into irrigated and rainfed croplands, and calculates irrigated and rainfed areas for every country in the world. LGRIP data are produced using Landsat 8 time-series satellite sensor data for the 2014-2017 time period to create a nominal 2015 product.\r\n\r\nEach LGRIP 30 meter resolution GeoTIFF file contains a contains a layer that identifies areas of rainfed cropland (cropland areas that are purely dependent on direct precipitation), irrigated cropland (cropland that had at least one irrigation during the crop growing period), non-cropland, and water bodies over a 10\u00b0 by 10\u00b0 area, as well as an accuracy assessment of the product. A low-resolution browse image is also available. \r\n",
