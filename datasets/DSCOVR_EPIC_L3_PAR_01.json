    "description": "DSCOVR_EPIC_L3_PAR_01 is the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) Level 3 photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) version 1 data product. The EPIC observations of the Earth\u2019s surface lit by the Sun made 13 times during the day in spectral bands centered on 443, 551, and 680 nm are used to estimate daily mean PAR at the ice-free ocean surface. PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the 400-700 nm range. Daily mean PAR is the 24-hour averaged planar flux in that spectral range reaching the surface. It is expressed in E.m-2.d-1 (Einstein per meter squared per day). The factor required to convert E.m-2 d-1 units to mW.cm-2.\u00b5m-1 units are equal to 0.838 to an inaccuracy of a few percent regardless of meteorological conditions. The EPIC daily mean PAR product is generated on Plate Carr\u00e9e (equal-angle) grid with an 18.4 km resolution at the equator and on an 18.4 km equal-area grid, i.e., the product is compatible with Ocean Biology Processing Group ocean color products.\r\nThe EPIC PAR algorithm uses a budget approach, in which the solar irradiance reaching the surface is obtained by subtracting from the irradiance arriving at the top of the atmosphere (known), the irradiance reflected space (estimated from the EPIC Level 1b radiance data), taking into account atmospheric transmission (modeled). Clear and cloudy regions within a pixel do not need to be distinguished. This dismisses the need for often-arbitrary assumptions about cloudiness distribution and is therefore adapted to the relatively large EPIC pixels. A daily mean PAR is estimated on the source grid for each EPIC instantaneous daytime observation, assuming no cloudiness changes during the day, and the individual estimates are remapped and weight-averaged using the cosine of the Sun zenith angle. In the computations, wind speed, surface pressure, and water vapor amount are extracted from NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) Reanalysis 2 data, aerosol optical thickness, and angstrom coefficient from MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) data, and ozone amount from EPIC Level 2 data. Areas contaminated by sun glint are excluded using a threshold on sun glint reflectance calculated using wind data. Ice masking is based on NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) near real-time ice fraction data. \r\nAdditional information about the EPIC ocean surface PAR products can be found at the NASA DSCOVR: EPIC website: https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/, under \u201cScience -> Products -> Ocean Surface\u201d (https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/products/ocean).",
