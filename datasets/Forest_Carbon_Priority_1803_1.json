    "description": "This dataset provides related gridded outputs of future modeled forest carbon sequestration priority and related species richness and habitat suitability for the western United States. The primary dataset is of the ranking of forest lands in the western U.S. for preservation based on the ability of these lands to sequester carbon over the coming century. The preservation ranking was derived from the results of simulations of future potential forest net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and vulnerability to drought and wildfire, as modeled from 2020 to 2099 at 4 km x 4 km resolution using a modified version of the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5). In addition, data files of potential forest NEP ranking and the forest vulnerability ranking are also provided. Co-located data of species richness for amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles are included to illustrate habitat suitability in relation to forest carbon preservation rankings. There are two files for each vertebrate class, one reflecting all western U.S. species included in the USGS GAP Analysis Project and a second for the subset of species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Establishing this forest carbon preservation priority ranking for forest lands in the western U.S. will help guide the conservation of land for climate change mitigation activities and improved harvest management in the region.",
