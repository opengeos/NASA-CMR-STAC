    "description": "Enhancing Knowledge of the Arabian Sea Marine environment through Science and Advanced Training (EKAMSAT) is a collaborative Indo-US field campaign funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Govt. of India and the Office of Naval Research, USA, focused on the acquisition of contemporary oceanographic and atmospheric datasets deemed critical for improving the predictive skills of operational monsoon models. The atmospheric and oceanographic datasets acquired will be used primarily to examine how oceanographic conditions such as recent SST increases, enhanced stratification, formation of boundary layers, a recurring warm water pool and other changes in the Arabian Sea are influencing the onset, intensity and length of the Indian monsoon. The campaign commenced with a pilot study in June 2023 in preparation for subsequent full-fledged field campaigns in May-June of 2024-2025. This and the following cruises target atmospheric and oceanographic measurements supplemented with limited bio-optical and biogeochemical observations to advance understanding of the influence of seasonally evolving mixed layer on biological productivity and biogeochemical cycling in northern Arabian Sea.
