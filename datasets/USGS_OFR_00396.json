    "description": "Beginning in 1995, the USGS, in cooperation with the U.S Army Corps of\nEngineers (USACE), New York District, began a program to generate\nreconnaissance maps of the sea floor offshore of the New York-New\nJersey metropolitan area, one of the most populated coastal regions of\nthe United States. The goal of this mapping program is to provide a\nregional synthesis of the sea-floor environment, including a\ndescription of sedimentary environments, sediment texture, seafloor\nmorphology, and geologic history to aid in understanding the impacts\nof anthropogenic activities, such as ocean dumping. This mapping\neffort differs from previous studies of this area by obtaining\ndigital, sidescan sonar images that cover 100 percent of the sea\nfloor.  This investigation was motivated by the need to develop an\nenvironmentally acceptable solution for the disposal of dredged\nmaterial from the New York - New Jersey Port, by the need to identify\npotential sources of sand for renourishment of the southern shore of\nLong Island, and by the opportunity to develop a better understanding\nof the transport and long-term fate of contaminants by investigations\nof the present distribution of materials discharged into the New York\nBight over the last 100+ years (Schwab and others, 1997).\n\nThis DVD-ROM contains copies of the navigation and field Water Gun\nsubbottom data collected aboard the R/V Seaward Explorer, from 1 May -\n9 June, 1996.  This DVD-ROM (Digital Versatile Disc-Read Only Memory)\nhas been produced in accordance with the UDF (Universal Disc Format)\nDVD-ROM Standard (ISO 9660 equivalent) and is therefore capable of\nbeing read on any computing platform that has appropriate DVD-ROM\ndriver software installed. Access to the data and information\ncontained on this DVD-ROM was developed using the HyperText Markup\nLanguage (HTML) utilized by the World Wide Web (WWWW). Development of\nthe DVD-ROM documentation and user interface in HTML allows a user to\naccess the information by using a variety of WWW browsers to\nfacilitate browsing and locating information and data. To access the\ninformation contained on this disk with a WWW client browser, open the\nfile'index.htm' at the top level directory of this DVD-ROM with your\nselected browser. The HTML documentation is written utilizing some\nHTML 4.0 enhancements. The disk should be viewable by all WWW browsers\nbut may not properly format on some older WWW browsers. Also, some\nlinks to USGS collaborators and other agencies are available on this\nDVD-ROM.  These links are only accessible if access to the Internet is\navailable during browsing of the DVD-ROM.",
