    "description": "After a major dieback of Scots pines in the Valais, an inner Alpine valley in Switzerland, the colonization of differently vigorous pines by stem and branch insects was investigated to assess their role in tree mortality. At 2 locations, the needle loss (defoliation) of some 500 pine trees was assessed twice a year. Of these trees, 34-36 trees were cut each year between 2001-2005 across all defoliation classes. From each tree, two 75-cm bolts were cut from both the stem and thick branches. They were incubated in photo-eclectors (metal cabinets) set up in a greenhouse where the insects could develop under the bark. The emerged adults were collected in water-filled eclector boxes and identified to species level by specialists. Attack time was estimated from the development time of each insect species emerged. The colonisation densities of the trees were related to the transparency level of each host tree at the time of attack.",
