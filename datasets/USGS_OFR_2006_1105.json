    "description": "Urbanization has dramatically increased precipitation runoff to the system of\ndrainage channels and natural stream channels in the Albuquerque, New Mexico,\nmetropolitan area. Rainfall and runoff data are important for planning and\ndesigning future storm-water conveyance channels in newly developing areas.\nStorm-water quality also is monitored in accordance with the National Pollutant\nDischarge Elimination System mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency. The Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority, the City\nof Albuquerque, and the U.S. Geological Survey began a cooperative program to\ncollect hydrologic data to assist in assessing the quality and quantity of\nsurface-water resources in the Albuquerque area. This report presents\nwater-quality, streamflow, and rainfall data collected from October 1, 2003, to\nSeptember 30, 2004 (water year 2004). Also provided is a station analysis for\neach of the 18 streamflow-gaging sites and 39 rainfall-gaging sites, which\nincludes a description of monitoring equipment, problems associated with data\ncollection during the year, and other information used to compute streamflow\ndischarges or rainfall records. A hydrographic comparison shows the effects\nthat the largest drainage channel in the metropolitan area, the North Floodway\nChannel, has on total flow in the Rio Grande.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
