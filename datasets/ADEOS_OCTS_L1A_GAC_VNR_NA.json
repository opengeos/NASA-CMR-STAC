    "description": "ADEOS OCTS L1A GAC VNR dataset is obtained from OCTS (Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner) sensor onboard ADEOS and produced by NASDA (National Space Development Agency of Japan). Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) is sun-synchronous quasi-recurrent orbiter launched on August 17, 1996, and carries OCTS (Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner) and AVNIR (Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer) sensor.The main objectives of ADEOS (MIDORI) is to contribute to elucidation of phenomena of the earth system through integrated observation of geophysical parameters using a number of sensors. ADEOS operation on orbit was given up on June 30, 1997, because the generated power was lost due to the accident of the blanket of the solar array paddle breaking. OCTS observes the amount of chlorophyll and various substances contained in the sea, sea surface temperature, cloud formation process, etc by receiving 12 bands of wavelengths from the visible light region to the thermal infrared region. The observation field of OCTS is about 1400km, and it is possible to scan in the north-south direction. Those sensors aim at collecting global data for mainly understanding the state of the ocean and its phenomena.This product is GAC (Global Area Coverage) visible and near Infrared band (VNR) data cut out into scenes from Level 0 data. GAC product contains one scene data that observed with the same tilt angle continuously within sun shining period: tilt segment. GAC data are subsampled from full-resolution data with about every sixth pixel of a scan line and every fifth line recorded. This product also contains radiometric correction coefficients required for data correction (each band, each pixel) and geometric correction information. Furthermore, supplemental information, such as the telemetry of OCTS, quality information, the sun vector, scene information and others are included.The provided format is HDF4 format The Spatial resolution is 700 m.",
