The maps were prepared by Environmental Systems Research\nInstitute (ESRI), USA. Most data for the database were provided by the\nSoil Resources, Management and Conservation Service Land and Water\nDevelopment Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\nItaly.  The database was developed by the United Nations Environment\nProgram (UNEP as part of a project initiated by UNEP.\n\nThe base maps used were the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World\n(1977) in Miller Oblated Stereographic projection, FAO Maps and\nStatistical Data by Administrative Unit (1983), and the Rand-McNally\nNew International Atlas (1982).  All sources were re-registered to the\nbasemap by comparing known features on the basemap and the source\nmaps. The digitizing was done with a spatial resolution of 0.002\ninches. The maps were then transformed from inch coordinates to\nlatitude/longitude degrees. The transformation was done by an\nunpublished algorithm (by US Geological Survey and ESRI) to create\ncoverage\"'\"s for one-degree graticules.\n\nContact: UNEP/GRID-Nairobi, P O Box 30552 Nairobi, Kenya FAO, Soil\nResources, Management and Conservation Service 00100, Rome, Italy.\nESRI, 380 New York Street, Redlands, CA 92373, USA\n\n\nThe ADMINLL file shows adminstrative boundries at continental, national,\nsecond and third levels in lat/long\n\nReferences:\n\nESRI.
