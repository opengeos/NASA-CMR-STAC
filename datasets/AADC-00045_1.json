    "description": "This dataset contains current meter data from Prydz Bay, Antarctica. Current meters were deployed on 5 moorings around Prydz Bay between March 1987 and February 1988. Summary results and deployment details are in the documentation. Temperature and salinity were also recorded. Records are not continuous at each site over this time period. Mooring 1 had a single current meter with a target depth of 100-200m, mooring 2 had 2 Aanderaa current meters with deployment depths of 223m and 425m and an S4 current vector-averaging meter at 123m from the surface, mooring 3 had 2 Aanderaa current meters at target depths of 300m and 1500m, Mooring 4 had 4 Aanderaa current meters with depths of 182m, 328m, 430m and 512m, mooring 5 had 4 Aanderaa meters at 273m, 419m, 567m and 670m. Three moorings were deployed for a full year, March 1987 to February 1988 (the 'winter' deployment) and 2 moorings released in October 1987 for about 4 months ('summer' deployment). Six of the 12 current meters deployed were recovered.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nDEVICE IDENTIFICATION\nSAMPLE PERIOD\nTEMPERATURE PARAMETERS\nCONDUCTIVITY PARAMETERS\nSEA CURRENT DIRECTION PARAMETERS\nSEA CURRENT SPEED PARAMETERS\nDATE\nTIME\nTEMPERATURE (DEGREES C)\nSALINITY (Ppt)\nDIRECTION (degrees)\nSPEED (knots)",
