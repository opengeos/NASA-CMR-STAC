    "description": "Metadata record for data from ASAC Project 2355 See the link below for public details on this project.\n\n---- Public Summary from Project ----\nWe will measure biodiversity of ecologically-important invertebrates (Collembola) in Antarctica, the sub-antarctic islands, and in Australia and New Zealand.  Using molecular and morphological techniques we will contribute to understanding of species distributions, and provide molecular data that will lead to automated species identifications.\n\nThis work is also related to ASAC project 2397, \"Introduced invasive terrestrial invertebrates on Macquarie Island: studies on ecology, origins and control\".\n\nField work was completed by David Gee on projects 2397 and 2355 on Macquarie Island from 4 to 13th March 2008.\n\nSee the word document in the download file for further information on the field work completed and the data collected.  Four excel spreadsheets are also available in the download file - spreadsheets for amphipods, collembola, flatworms and isopods.\n\nSome general comments about the spreadsheets:\n\n* FID and Id columns are those that are automatically generated when creating a layer in ArcGis.\n\n* Counts of all organisms in samples has not yet been completed.  Penny Greenslade will be attending to this in the future.  However, some count numbers are present on the isopod and amphipod sheets - this refers to isopods and amphipods observed during field work.\n\n* The tag column is a standard column for naming any points in the NSW government system.\n\nTaken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:\n\nPublic summary of the season progress:\nProgress on this project has been excellent in its first year. The timely appointment of a new PhD student in Oct 2009 (funded by The University of Adelaide) was fortunate and he went south with one assistant in Dec 2009. We collected all the soil samples that had been planned for the 2009/2010 season. Collections were focused on the Vestfold Hills, Larsemann Hills, Hop Island, Mather Peninsula, Sansom Island where the majority of time was spent, with opportunistic sampling at Casey (ASMA) and Mawson (Framnes) whilst in transit on the Aurora Australis. Once we obtain the samples in Adelaide (arrived on V4) which were returned to Hobart frozen then the processing will commence to retrieve the invertebrates.\n\nThe 2009-2010 data are accompanied by a spreadsheet detailing all column headings.",
