    "description": "Decommissioned product.\n\nThe Expedited ASTER Level-1B Registered Radiance at the Sensor data set is produced with the express purpose of providing ASTER Science Team members data of their particular interest in quick turn-around time from the moment the data are acquired. This is usually done to support on-going field calibration and validation efforts or to support emergency response to natural disasters when processed Level-1 data with minimum turn-around time would prove beneficial in initial damage or impact assessments. The granule content of this expedited data set is subject to change, because individual granules are held for a maximum of 30 days past ingest, then deleted. This is done because the routinely processed (Production Data Set or PDS) version of this data set will be available from Japan in due course and available for search and order from the LP DAAC archives. ASTER Expedited Data Sets (EDS) serve the short-term requirements of a small group of scientists and fulfill immediate imagery needs during times of natural disasters. \n\nThe general product description details as described for the ASTER Level-1B Data Set ??? Registered Radiance at the Sensor apply to the expedited data set with a few notable exceptions.  These include:\n     - The Expedited Level-1B data set does not contain the VNIR 3B (aft-\n        viewing) band\n     - This data set does not have short-term calibration for the Thermal \n        Infrared (TIR) sensor\n     - The registration quality of this data set is likely to be lower, and \n        also vary from scene to scene\n\nV002 data set release date: 2001-04-27\n\nData Set Characteristics: \nArea: ~60 km x 60 km \nImage Dimensions: \nVNIR: 4200 rows x 4980 columns \nSWIR: 2100 rows x 2490 columns \nTIR: 700 rows x 830 columns \n  File Size: \n  VNIR (1, 2, 3N): ~63 MB \n  SWIR (4 through 9): ~32 MB \n  TIR (10 through 14): ~6 <B \n  Total: 97 Megabytes \nUnits: w/m2/sr/??m\nProjection: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) \nData Format: HDF-EOS \nVgroup Data Fields = 14",
