    "description": "This dataset contains Daily Snow Cover Fraction of viewable snow from AVHRR, produced by the Snow project of the ESA Climate Change Initiative programme. Snow cover fraction viewable (SCFV) indicates the area of snow viewable from space over land surfaces. In forested areas this refers to snow viewable on top of the forest canopy. The SCFV is given in percentage (%) per pixel. The global SCFV product is available at about 5 km pixel size for all land areas, excluding Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets. The coastal zones of Greenland are included.The SCFV time series provides daily products for the period 1979-2023. The product V4.0 is based on EUMETSAT Fundamental Data Record (FDR) medium resolution optical satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Clouds are masked using the CLARA-A3 cloud product. The retrieval method of the snow_cci SCFV product from AVHRR data has been further developed and improved based on the ESA GlobSnow approach described by Mets\u00c3\u00a4m\u00c3\u00a4ki et al. (2015) and complemented with a pre- and post-classification module. All cloud free pixels are then used for the snow extent mapping, using spectral bands centred at about 0.63 \u00c2\u00b5m and 1.61 \u00c2\u00b5m (channel 3a or the reflective part of channel 3b (ref3b)), and an emissive band centred at about 10.8 \u00c2\u00b5m. The snow_cci snow cover mapping algorithm is a three-step approach: first, a strict pre-classification is applied to identify all cloud free pixels which are certainly snow free. For all remaining pixels, the snow_cci SCFV retrieval method is applied. Finally, a post-processing removes erroneous snow pixels caused either by falsely classified clouds in the tropics or by unreliable ref3b values at a global scale. The following auxiliary data set is used for product generation: ESA CCI Land Cover from 2000; water bodies and permanent snow and ice areas are masked based on this dataset. Both classes were separately aggregated to the pixel spacing of the SCF product. Water areas are masked if more than 50 percent of the pixel is classified as water, permanent snow and ice areas are masked if more than 50 percent are identified as such areas in the aggregated map. RMSE is retrieved from a statistical model and added as pixel-wise information.The SCFV product is aimed to serve the needs for users working in the cryosphere and climate research and monitoring activities, including the detection of variability and trends, climate modelling and aspects of hydrology, meteorology and biology.The Remote Sensing Research Group of the University of Bern, in cooperation with Gamma Remote Sensing is responsible for the SCFV product development and generation. ENVEO (ENVironmental Earth Observation IT GmbH) developed and prepared all auxiliary data sets used for the product generation. The SCFV AVHRR product comprises a few data gaps in 1979 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1986 (1979: 22.-24.Feb.; 01.-07.Oct.; 03.-04.Nov.; 07.Nov.; 17.-18.Nov.; 1980: 22.-27.Feb.; 01.March; 03.March; 15.-20.March; 30.March \u00e2\u0080\u0093 02.April; 26.-29.June; 12.-19.July; 12.-18.Dec.; 1981: 09.-11.May; 01.-03.Aug.; 14.-23.Aug.; 1982: 28.- 31.May; 25.-26. Oct.; 1983: 27.- 31. July; 01.- 02. and 06. Aug.; 1984: 14.-15.Jan.; 06. Dec.; 1985: 01.- 24.Feb; 1986: 15. March), resulting in a 99% data coverage over the entire study period of 43 years.",
