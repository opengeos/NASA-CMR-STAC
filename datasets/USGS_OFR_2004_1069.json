    "description": "Scientific measurements at Wolverine Glacier, on the Kenai Peninsula in\nsouth-central Alaska, began in April 1966. At three long-term sites in the\nresearch basin, the measurements included snow depth, snow density, heights of\nthe glacier surface and stratigraphic summer surfaces on stakes, and\nidentification of the surface materials. Calculations of the mass balance of\nthe surface strata-snow, new firn, superimposed ice, and old firn and ice mass\nat each site were based on these measurements. Calculations of fixed-date\nannual mass balances for each hydrologic year (October 1 to September 30), as\nwell as net balances and the dates of minimum net balance measured between\ntime-transgressive summer surfaces on the glacier, were made on the basis of\nthe strata balances augmented by air temperature and precipitation recorded in\nthe basin. From 1966 through 1995, the average annual balance at site A (590\nmeters altitude) was -4.06 meters water equivalent; at site B (1,070 meters\naltitude), was -0.90 meters water equivalent; and at site C (1,290 meters\naltitude), was +1.45 meters water equivalent.\n\nGeodetic determination of displacements of the mass balance stake, and glacier\nsurface altitudes was added to the data set in 1975 to detect the glacier\nmotion responses to variable climate and mass balance conditions. The average\nsurface speed from 1975 to 1996 was 50.0 meters per year at site A, 83.7 meters\nper year at site B, and 37.2 meters per year at site C. The average surface\naltitudes were 594 meters at site A, 1,069 meters at site B, and 1,293 meters\nat site C; the glacier surface altitudes rose and fell over a range of 19.4\nmeters at site A, 14.1 meters at site B, and 13.2 meters at site C. \n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
