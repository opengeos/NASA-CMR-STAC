    "description": "The foraging ecology of three fulmarine petrels including Cape petrels, Southern fulmars and Antarctic petrels were investigated at Hop Island during the 2015/16 austral summer. Two datasets were generated: 1) tracking data from Fulmarine petrels, and 2) stable isotope analysis of blood, feathers and egg shells. Tracking data were collected using Ecotone GPS trackers attached to the birds back feathers with tape. Location data has been interpolated using great circle distance to a time step of 15 minutes and include a record of whether the bird dived during that time period or not. Each location point was assigned a breeding stage (incubation or chick rearing) based on individual nest activities. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) were determined by analysing 1 mg aliquots through continuous flow - elemental analysis - isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-EA-IRMS). Isotopic values of blood reflect approximately the last 52 days before sampling and thus the incubation period of all three species. Egg membranes and feathers remain metabolically inert after formation, and hence reflect the trophic niche during the pre-laying and moult period, respectively. We collected moult feathers during the chick-rearing period and therefore assumed that these were formed one year prior to the collection date and thus represent the trophic niche of the chick-rearing period one year earlier (austral summer 2014-15).",
