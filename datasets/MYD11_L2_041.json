    "description": "The MYD11_L2.041 dataset was decommissioned as of March 1, 2018. Users are encouraged to use Version 6 of MODIS/Aqua Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity 5-Minute L2 Swath 1 km (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11_l2.006). \r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua version-041 (V41) products use a modified version-4 (V4) LST algorithm and version-5 (V5) data inputs. The V41 products primarily address underestimation problems in the V5 Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) products. Recent validation activities reveal that the V5 CMG products underestimate LSTs up to 6K especially in desert and semi-arid regions. The production date for this collection starts from MODIS/Aqua data acquisition date 2007-001. This beginning date is driven by the availability of the MODIS V5 data inputs (level-1B radiance data, geolocation data, cloud mask, atmospheric profiles, and land and snow cover data).\r\n\r\nThe MODIS/Aqua V41 level-2 LST/E data (Short name: MYD11_L2) incorporate 1-km pixels, which are produced daily at 5-minute increments using the generalized split-window LST algorithm. This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of atmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into tractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in bands 31 and 32 are estimated from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe V41 MYD11_L2 data set comprises swath data obtained in 5-minute sensor collection periods, and includes the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers: LST, quality control assessment, error estimates, bands 31 and 32 emissivities, zenith angle of the pixel view, observation time, and the geographic coordinates for every five scan lines and samples. Produced daily, MYD11_L2 is an unprojected level-2 data set, which provides the input for the level-3 products.\r\n\r\nThe V41 Aqua/MODIS LST/E products, including MYD11_L2 are validated to Stage-1. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\r\n\r\nThe V41 MYD11_L2 product\u2019s acquisition range started January 1, 2007 (2007-001) and continued through March 30, 2017. The V41 LST products from 2007-001 will remain consistent with similar products from V4, and hence are amenable to combine them in a time series analysis. Users should exercise caution, and not mix the V4.x (i.e., V4 and V41) and V5 LST products in their analysis.\r\n\r\nV041 Data Set Characteristics:  \r\nArea: ~2330 km x 2000 km lat/long\r\nImage Dimensions: 2030 x 1354 rows/columns\r\nFile Size: ~26 MB \r\nResolution: 1000 meters \r\nProjection: None (swath data) \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 9",
