    "description": "This dataset contains the following information with regards to the Ecotox Project:\nGeneral location and sampling date metadata.\nSoil characteristic analysis such as grain size, etc.\nFull breakdown of TPH (Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon) analysis generated through GC (Gas Chromatography) which includes individual compounds, ranges and ratios.\nDry matter fraction and loss on ignition.\nChemistry via water extraction, bicarb extraction and KCl extraction.\nCEC (Cation Exchange Capacity) exchangeable ion analysis.\nXRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) analysis\n\nAbundance matrices:\nThis dataset contains information obtained by pyrosequencing genomic DNA extracts from soil with PCR primers targeting the bacterial 16S gene (27F/519R) and fungal ITS region (ITS1/ITS4-B).  The data was processed in a pipeline using freely available 'mothur' software (v1.24.1).  The reads were processed in 4 ways, this was a combination of subsampling the data to a number that normalised all but the 10 lowest samples and excluding operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that only occurred once in the entire dataset.  This resulted in designations FULL_READS for the unsubsampled analyses, and SUBSAMPLED for those subsampled.  \nFor each of these combinations an OTU abundance matrix was generated which is a table of OTU by samples and the corresponding abundance of the OTU.",
