    "description": "The CO2_GOS_SRFP dataset comprises level 2, column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (mixing ratios) for carbon dioxide (XCO2), from the Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for Carbon Observations (TANSO-FTS) NIR and SWIR spectra, onboard the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). It has been produced using the RemoTeC Full Physics (SRFP) algorithm, v2.3.8, by the Greenhouse Gases Climate Change Initiative (GHG_cci) project.  This forms part of the GHG_cci Climate Research Data Package Number 4 (CRDP#4).The RemoTeC Full Physics (SRFP) algorithm has been jointly developed at SRON and KIT.   A second product, generated using the OCFP (University of Leicester Full Physics) algorithm, is also available, and is considered the GHG_cci baseline product, whilst the SRFP product forms an 'alternative' product.  It is advised that users who aren't sure whether to use the baseline or alternative product use the OCFP product.  For more information on the differences between baseline and alternative algorithms please see the Greenhouse Gases CCI data products webpage.   The data product is stored per day in a single NetCDF file. Retrieval results are provided for the individual GOSAT spatial footprints, no averaging having been applied. The product file contains the key standard products, i.e. the retrieved column averaged dry air mixing ratio XCO2 with bias correction, averaging kernels and quality flags, as well as secondary products specific for the RemoTeC algorithm. For further information, including details of the SRFP algorithm and the TANSO-FTS instrument, please see the associated product user guide (PUG) or the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document.",
