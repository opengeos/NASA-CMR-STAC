    "description": "Vegetation field plots at Isle Royale National Park were visited, described,\nand documented in a digital database. The database consists of 2 parts - (1)\nPhysical Descriptive Data and (2) Species Listings.\n\nThe vegetation plots were used to describe the vegetation in and around Wind\nCave National Park and to assist in developing a final mapping classification\nsystem.\n\nThe purpose of the vegetation plots was to provide National Parks with the\nnecessary tools to effectively manage their natural resources. Plot data are\ncollected and analyzed to develop a classification (using the Standardized\nNational Vegetation Classification System) and description of vegetation types\nin preparation for photointerpretation and mapping of the Park's vegetation\ntypes.\n\nIsle Royale National Park was authorized on March 3, 1931; it was formally\nestablished in 1940, and officially dedicated in 1946. Most of the park's land\narea (98%) was designated as a Wilderness area in October 1976, and later\nadditions increased the total Wilderness to 99% of the park. The park was\ndesignated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980.\n\nField sampling was performed using releve plots.\n\nInformation for this metadata was obtained from the site\nhttp://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/isro/metaisrofield.html and converted to NASA\nDirectory Interchange Format.",
