    "description": "This dataset contains in situ measurements of ice thickness, snow thickness, and freeboard along transects on the ice-station floes from the SIPEX2012. Ice cores were collected and snow pits were measured at the 0m, 50m and 100m mark along each transect, where possible. Ice temperature measurements are taken in the field as soon as the ice core sections have been recovered from the core hole. Additionally, ice cores were taken for density analysis at a few of the ice-core sites for independent verification of ice density. In addition, electromagnetic [EM] induction measurements of total ice and snow thickness were conducted along the transect where possible.\n\nIce core were transferred -20oC freezer for thin-section analysis for sea-ice stratigraphy and crystallography. The cores are then cut up into suitable short sections, generally about 5cm long, to be melted  for analysis of salinity and stable oxygen isotopes. The latter will occur after the end of this cruise.\n\nThere is a data file for each ice station, containing a spreadsheet with the data. The spreadsheet contains information about how to interpret the data. \nAlso included are the scanned field notes containing the hand-written (raw) data collected in the field.\n\nAmong many, many volunteers, whose help is gratefully acknowledged here, the following persons were involved in data collection along the transect:\n\nMr Olivier Lecomte, Univ Catholique, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, Member of observation team, olivier.lecomte@uclouvain.be\nDr T. Toyota, Inst Low Temp Science, Japan, Member of observation team, toyota@lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp\nDr A. Giles, ACE CRC,  Member of observation team, barry.giles@utas.edu.au\nDr T. Tamura, NIPR, Japan, Member of EM observation team; tamura.takeshi@nipr.ac.jp\nMr K. Nakata, EES, Japan, Member of EM observation team; kazuki-nakata@ees.hokudai.ac.jp\n\nData were collected on the following dates:\nIce Station 2: 27 - 28 September 2012\nIce Station 3: 03 - 04 October 2012\nIce Station 4: 06 - 08 October 2012\nIce Station 6: 13 - 14 October 2012\nIce Station 7: 19 - 23 October 2012\nIce Station 8: 29 October - 04 November 2012",
