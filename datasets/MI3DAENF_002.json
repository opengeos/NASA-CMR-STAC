    "description": "It contains a statistical summary of column aerosol  \n           555 nanometer optical depth, and a monthly aerosol  \n           compositional type frequency histogram. Data collection  \n           for this product is ongoing. This data product is a  \n           global summary of the Level 2 aerosol parameters of  \n           interest averaged over a day and reported on a  \n           geographic grid, with a resolution of 0.5 degree by 0.5  \n           degree.   \n             \n           FIRSTLOOK processing uses the new time dependence of  \n           the Atmospheric and Surface Climatology (TASC) from the  \n           same month/previous year. The TASC data set now  \n           contains snow ice and ocean surface wind speed values  \n           that are updated on a monthly basis. Therefore, these  \n           data sets cannot be generated until the end of the  \n           month. Products generated are distinguished by the  \n           presence of FIRST LOOK in the file names. The MISR  \n           instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which  \n           measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global  \n           coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are  \n           arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir,  \n           four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras  \n           pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine  \n           cameras to view the same surface location. The view  \n           angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid are  \n           0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral  \n           band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443,  \n           555, 670, and 865 nm.  \n             \n           MISR itself is an instrument designed to view Earth  \n           with cameras pointed in 9 different directions. As the  \n          \"instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth s.\"\n           the surface below is successively imaged by all nine cameras  \n           in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and  \n           near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our  \n           understanding of the effects of sunlight on Earth and to distinguish different types of clouds,  \n           particles, and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the  \n           monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas:  \n           1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols),  \n           including those formed by natural sources and by human  \n           activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds,  \n           and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including  \n           vegetation canopy structure.",
