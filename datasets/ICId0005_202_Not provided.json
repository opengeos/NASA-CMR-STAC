    "description": "In the recent past, there has been continuing growth in using GIS and related\n            technologies by many organizations engaged in planning and management of the\n            Kathmandu Valley. As a result, the demand for accurate and homogenous spatial\n            data of the Valley has been realized by government as well as research and\n            development organizations.\n            \n            This study attempts to build a comprehensive GIS Database of the Kathmandu\n            Valley with an aim to bridge the important data gaps in the Valley. The study\n            employs a fresh approach in constructing a GIS database with the available maps\n            and integrates many different kinds of satellite imageries. The maps presented\n            in this publication visualize the different scenarios and raise the awareness\n            of exiting digital database. The application presented in this publication\n            shall increase awareness about the usefulness of digital database and\n            demonstrate what can be achieved with the GIS and related technologies. The\n            database thus developed shall improve the availability of information of the\n            Kathmandu Valley and assist different stakeholders engaged in planning and\n            management of the Valley.\n            \n            Furthermore, the study advocates a building block approach to development,\n            management and revision of database in a complementary way and it hopes to\n            avoid duplication of efforts in costly production of digital data. The study\n            hopes to sensitise senior executives and decision-makers about the need for a\n            sound policy on database sharing, development and standards. Such a policy, at\n            the national level known as National Spatial Database Infrastructure (NSDI)\n            should evolve in order to benefit from the prevailing GIS technology. In using\n            GIS and related technologies, the study facilitated the establishment of\n            Spatial Data Infrastructure of the Kathmandu Valley in a concrete manner.\n            \n            \n            Members informations:\n            Attached Vector(s):\n              MemberID: 1\n            Vector Name: Contours\n            Source Map Name: topo sheets\n            Source Map Scale: 25000\n            Source Map Date: 1905-06-17\n            Projection: transverse mercator\n            Projection_desc: origin 87E/ 0N, false easting=900000, scale=0.9999\n            Projection_meas: Meter\n            Feature_type: lines\n            Vector \n            Contours digitized from topo sheets\n            \n            Members informations:\n            Attached Vector(s):\n              MemberID: 2\n            Vector Name: Roads\n            Source Map Name: topo sheet\n            Source Map Scale: 25000\n            Source Map Date: 1905-06-17\n            Projection: see member1\n            Feature_type: lines\n            Vector \n            Road Network\n            \n            Members informations:\n            Attached Vector(s):\n              MemberID: 3\n            Vector Name: Drainage\n            Source Map Name: topo sheets\n            Source Map Scale: 25000\n            Source Map Date: 1905-06-17\n            Projection: see member 1\n            Feature_type: lines\n            Vector \n            Drainage Network\n            \n            Members informations:\n            Attached Vector(s):\n              MemberID: 4\n            Vector Name: Land use 78\n            Source Map Name: LRMP\n            Source Map Scale: 50000\n            Source Map Date: 1905-05-31\n            Feature_type: polygon\n            Vector \n            Land use\n            \n            Members informations:\n            Attached Vector(s):\n              MemberID: 5\n            Vector Name: Land use 1995\n            Source Map Name: topo sheet\n            Source Map Scale: 25000\n            Source Map Date: 1905-06-17\n            Feature_type: polygon\n            Vector \n            Land cover\n            \n            \n            Members informations:\n            Attached Vector(s):\n              MemberID: 6\n            Vector Name: Administrative boundaries\n            Source Map Name: topo sheet\n            Source Map Scale: 25000\n            Source Map Date: 1905-06-17\n            Feature_type: polygon\n            Vector \n            District and VDC boundaries and various socio-economic data\n            \n            Attached Report(s)\n            Member ID: 7\n            Report Name: Kathmandu Valley GIS database\n            Report Authors: B.
