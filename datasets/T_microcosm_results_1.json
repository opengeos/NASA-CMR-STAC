    "description": "Geochemical, microbial and 14C data on remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in Antarctica.\n\nThis record is part of ASAC project 1163 (ASAC_1163).\n\nMicrocosm study using Old Casey petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sediment investigating the effect of temperature on biodegradation. The experiment was performed over a temperature range of -2 to 42 degrees. The experiment was run over 40 days. Degradation was traced by radiometric methods and total aliphatic hydrocarbons were measured by gas chromatography.\nRadiometric data in file radiometric_99.xls, Gas Chromatography data in file\ngc_99.xls.\n\nThe radiometric spreadsheet is divided up as follows:\nCALCULATIONS is how much nutrients, water, radioactivity was added to the sediment.\nSUMMARY is what went into each microcosm flask.\n%DPMVRST are recovery graphs of individual flasks.\nAVERAGE RECOVERY and FIRST ORDER are graphs.\n-2A,-2B etc are the raw data for each flask. The number refers to the temperature, the letter refers to the replicate.\n\nThe gc_99 spreadsheet is divided up as follows:\nMicroN2B, MicroN2C etc is the raw gas chromatography data, peak areas, heights, amount extracted.  This spreadsheet uses the same codes as the radiometric spreadsheet in the metadata record entitled: 'Mineralisation results using 14C octadecane at a range of water, nutrient levels and freeze thaw cycles'.\nSUMMARY is the actual hydrocarbon concentrations in ug/g and weathering indices.\nGRAPHS-ABS are the graphs of absolute concentrations.\nGRAPHS-RATIO are the graphs of weathering indices.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\nDays - Since experiment started.\nHours - Since experiment started.\nWeight of NaOH (g)\nCount (dpm) - measurement from radiation counter - disintegrations per minute.\nDiscarded dpm's - counts 'lost' from the system. Used in a 'mass balance'.\nVolume NaOH (ml)\ndpm in trap/dresschel bottle\nAbsolute dpm's\n% dpm recovered\nmillimole octadecane mineralised\n\nRetention Time\nArea\n% Area\nHeight of peak\nAmount\nInt Type\nUnits\nPeak Type\nCodes",
