    "description": "The map shows the altitude below sea level of the base of the Biscayne aquifer in Miami-Dade County. The contour interval is 10 feet.\n      \n      Southeastern Florida is underlain by geologic units of varying permeability from land surface to depths between 150 and 400 ft. These units form an unconfined aquifer system that is the source of most of the potable water used in the area. This body of geologic units is called the surficial aquifer system. In parts of Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, a highly permeable part of that aquifer system has been named the Biscayne aquifer (Parker, 1951; Parker and others, 1955). Adjacent to or underlying the Biscayne aquifer are less-permeable but potentially important water-bearing units that also are part of the surficial aquifer system. Most previous hydrogeologic investigations in southeastern Florida concentrated on the populated coastal area. Drilling and monitoring activities were commonly restricted to zones used for water supply or to overlying zones. Hence, information on the characteristics of the western or deeper parts of the Biscayne aquifer and of sediments below the Biscayne aquifer in the surficial aquifer system was insufficient for present needs. Continuing increases in the demand for water from the surficial aquifer system in the highly populated coastal area of southeastern Florida and attendant concerns for the protection and management of the water supply have resulted in a study by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the South Florida Water Management District, to define the extent of the surficial aquifer system and its regional hydrogeologic characteristics. The overall objectives of the regional study are to determine the geologic framework of the surficial aquifer system, the areal and vertical water-quality distribution, factors that affect water quality, the hydraulic characteristics of the components of the surficial aquifer system, and to describe ground-water flow in the aquifer system.",
