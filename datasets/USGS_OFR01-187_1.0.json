    "description": "The purpose of this preliminary digital map is to provide a geographically\nreferenced data base showing regional patterns in the distribution of rock\ntypes in the Virginia and Maryland parts of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  The\nmap may be used to evaluate the hypothesis that lithology of rocks and\nsediments significantly influences the chemistry and quality of waters\ntraveling over and through them on a regional scale.\n\nThis preliminary experimental lithogeochemical map shows the distribution of\nrock types in the Virginia and Maryland parts of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. \nThe map was produced digitally by classifying geologic-map units according to\ncomposition, mineralogy, and texture; rather than by age and stratigraphic\nrelationships as shown on traditional geologic maps.  This map differs from\nmost lithologic maps in that the lithogeochemical unit classification\ndistinguishes those rock units having key water-reactive minerals that may\ninduce acid neutralization, or reduction, of hosted water at the weathering\ninterface.  The validity of these rock units, however, is independent of water\nchemistry, because the rock units are derived from geologic maps and rock\ndescriptions. Areas of high soil carbon content, and sulfide metal deposits are\nalso shown.\n\nWater-reactive minerals and their weathering reactions yield five\nlithogeochemical unit classes: 1) carbonate rock and calcareous rocks and\nsediments, the most acid-neutralizing; 2)carbonaceous-sulfidic rocks and\nsediments, oxygen-depleting and reducing; 3) quartzofeldspathic rocks and\nsiliciclastic sediments, relatively weakly reactive with water; 4) mafic\nsilicate rocks/sediments, oxygen consuming and high solute-load delivering;\nand, 5) the rarer calcareous-sulfidic (carbonaceous) rocks, neutralizing and\nreducing. Earlier studies in some parts of the map area have related solute\nloads in ground and stream waters to some aspects of bedrock lithology. More\nrecent preliminary tests of relationships between four of the classes of mapped\nlithogeochemical units and ground water chemistry, in the Mid-Atlantic area\nusing this map, have focused on and verified the nitrate-reducing and\nacid-neutralizing properties of some bedrock and unconsolidated aquifer rock\ntypes.  Sulfide mineral deposits and their mine-tailings effects on waters are\nbeginning to be studied by others. Additional testing of relationships among\nthe lithogeochemical units and aspects of ground and surface water chemistry\ncould help to refine the lithogeochemical classification, and this map. The\ntesting could also improve the usefulness of the map for assessing aquifer\nreactivity and the transport properties of reactive contaminants such as acid\nrain, and nitrate from agricultural sources, in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n\nData were originally collected in UTM coordinates, zone 18, NAD 1927, and\nprojected to geographic coordinates (Lat/Long), NAD 1983.  The data base is\naccompanied by a large format color map, a readme.txt file, and a explanatory\nPDF pamphlet.",
