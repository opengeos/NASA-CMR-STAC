    "description": "This project has two objectives: 1) update and reconfigure the Flow and Transport in a Linked Overland/Aquifer Density-Dependent System (FTLOADDS) modeling code to include all version modifications and enhancements in order to provide easier transition for coupling of models and 2) to develop a comprehensive model by using the established USGS Tides and Inflows to the Mangrove Ecotone (TIME) model application of the southern Everglades and linking it to a coupled surface and ground water model application of Biscayne Bay that is currently in development.\n      \n      The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to reestablish predevelopment natural flows in the Everglades system and surrounding areas including Biscayne Bay. The changes proposed within this plan may cause significant alterations to the hydrologic conditions that exist in both Everglades National Park (ENP) and Biscayne National Park (BNP). System-wide, there are water management, water supply, and environmental concerns regarding the impact of wetland restoration on groundwater flow between the ENP and BNP and along the L-31 and C-111 canals. For example, restoration of wetlands may lead to increases in coastal ground-water levels and cause offshore springs in Biscayne Bay to become reestablished as a significant site of freshwater discharge in BNP. Accordingly, the CERP restoration activities may increase the rate of coastal groundwater discharge and aid transport of anthropogenic contaminants into the offshore marine ecosystem. Under this scenario, there is significant potential for habitat deterioration of many different threatened or endangered species of plants and animals that reside along the coastline of Biscayne Bay, in the Bay, or on the coral reef tract. In contrast to a surface water system which has been extensively compartmentalized and channelized, the Biscayne aquifer which flows under both ENP and BNP is continuous and not as amenable to partial domain simulation. A comprehensive model is needed to reliably and credibly assess the effects of groundwater flow and transport on both parks. Hydrologic conditions should be evaluated prior to substantial water delivery changes in order to protect these sensitive ecosystems. A numerical model that can simulate salinity and surface and ground-water flow patterns under different hydrologic conditions is an essential part of this effort. The USGS developed a coupled surface-water/ground-water numerical code known as the Flow and Transport in a Linked Overland/Aquifer Density-Dependent System (FTLOADDS) to represent the surface water and ground-water hydrologic conditions in south Florida, specifically in the Everglades. The FTLOADDS code combines the two-dimensional hydrodynamic surface-water model SWIFT2D to simulate variable density overland flow (Schaffranek, 2004; Swain, 2005), the three-dimensional ground-water model SEAWAT to simulate fully-saturated variable-density groundwater flow (Guo and Langevin, 2002), and accounts for leakage and salt flux between the surface water and ground water (Langevin and others, 2005). The code was then applied to two major testing regions: 1) the Southern Inland and Coastal Systems (SICS) model domain (Swain and others, 2004) and 2) the Tides and Inflows in the Mangroves of the Everglades (TIME) model domain. The first application used code versions 1.0 and 1.1 which only utilized the SWIFT2D surface-water code. Later applications in the SICS area used version 2.1 (Langevin and others, 2005) where SWIFT2D was coupled to the SEAWAT groundwater model code. The second domain, TIME (Wang and others, 2007), utilizes the enhanced version 2.2 code, which includes enhancements to the wetting and drying routines, changes to the frictional resistance terms applications, and calculations of evapotranspiration. In 2006, FTLOADDS was modified again to represent Biscayne Bay and surrounding areas. This will provide one large sub-regional model that will give an integrated comprehensive assessment of how different scenarios will affect water flows in both Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park. Once calibrated, additional simulations will be performed to estimate predevelopment hydrologic conditions and to predict hydrologic conditions under one or more of the proposed restoration alternatives, using inputs from the Natural Systems Model (NSM) (SFWMD, 1997A) and the South Florida Water Management Model (SFWMM) (MacVicar and others, 1984, SFWMD, 1997B).",
