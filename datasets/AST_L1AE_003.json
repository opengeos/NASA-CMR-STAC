    "description": "The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Expedited Level 1A Reconstructed Unprocessed Instrument Data (AST_L1AE) global product contains reconstructed, unprocessed instrument digital data derived from the acquired telemetry streams of the telescopes: Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR), Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR). This data product is similar to the (AST_L1A) (http://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) with a few notable exceptions. These include:\r\n* The AST_L1AE is available for download within 48 hours of acquisition in support of field calibration and validation efforts, in addition to emergency response for natural disasters where the quick turn-around time from acquisition to availability would prove beneficial in initial damage or impact assessments.\r\n* The registration quality of the AST_L1AE is likely to be lower than the AST_L1A, and may vary from scene to scene.\r\n* The AST_L1AE data product does not contain the VNIR 3B (aft-viewing) Band.\r\n* This dataset does not have short-term calibration for the Thermal Infrared (TIR) sensor.\r\n* The AST_L1AE data product is only available for download 30 days after acquisition. It is then removed and reprocessed into an AST_L1A product.",
