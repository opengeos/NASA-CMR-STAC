    "description": "The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instrument continues the long-term monitoring of atmospheric trace gas constituents started with GOME / ERS-2 and SCIAMACHY / Envisat. Currently, there are three GOME-2 instruments operating on board EUMETSAT's Meteorological Operational satellites MetOp-A, -B, and -C, launched in October 2006, September 2012, and November 2018, respectively. GOME-2 can measure a range of atmospheric trace constituents, with the emphasis on global ozone distributions. Furthermore, cloud properties and intensities of ultraviolet radiation are retrieved. These data are crucial for monitoring the atmospheric composition and the detection of pollutants. DLR generates operational GOME-2 / MetOp level 2 products in the framework of EUMETSAT's Satellite Application Facility on Atmospheric Chemistry Monitoring (AC-SAF). GOME-2 near-real-time products are available already two hours after sensing.\t\t\tThe operational NO2 total column products are generated using the algorithm GDP (GOME Data Processor) version 4.x integrated into the UPAS (Universal Processor for UV / VIS Atmospheric Spectrometers) processor for generating level 2 trace gas and cloud products.\t\t\tThe operational SO2 total column products are generated using the algorithm GDP (GOME Data Processor) version 4.x integrated into the UPAS (Universal Processor for UV / VIS Atmospheric Spectrometers) processor for generating level 2 trace gas and cloud products. GDP 4.x performs a DOAS fit for SO2 slant column followed by an AMF / VCD computation using a single wavelength. Corrections are applied to the slant column for equatorial offset, interference of SO2 and SO2 absorption, and SZA dependence.\t\t\tFor more details please refer to relevant peer-review papers listed on the GOME and GOME-2 documentation pages: https://atmos.eoc.dlr.de/app/docs/",
