    "description": "This dataset contains observations of ice conditions taken from the bridge of the RV Aurora Australis during SIPEX 2012, following the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research/CliC Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate [ASPeCt] protocols. See aspect.antarctica.gov.au \n\nObservations include total and partial concentration, ice type, thickness, floe size, topography, and snow cover in each of three primary ice categories; open water characteristics, and weather summary.\n\nThe dataset is comprised of the scanned pages of a single logbook, which holds hourly observations taken by observers while the ship was moving through sea-ice zone.\n\nThe following persons assisted in the collection of these data:\nDr R. Massom, AAD, Member of observation team\nMr A. Steer, AAD, Member of observation team\nProf S. Warren, UW(Seattle), USA, Member of observation team\nDr J.
