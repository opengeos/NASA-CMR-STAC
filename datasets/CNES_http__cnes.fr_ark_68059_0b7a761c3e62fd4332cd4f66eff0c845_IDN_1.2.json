    "description": "The products offered by the Hydroweb project consist of continuous, long-duration time-series of the levels of large lakes with surface areas over 100 km2, reservoirs and the 20 biggest rivers in the world.The operational measurement series are updated no later than 1.5 days after a new altimetry measurement becomes available. They cover about 80 large lakes and 300 measurement points along about 20 major rivers.The research measurement series are updated at regular intervals according to the progress made with processing by the LEGOS laboratory. They cover about 150 large lakes and 1,000 measurement points along about 20 major rivers.Continental waters account for only 0.65% of the total amount of water on Earth, 97% being stored in the oceans and 2.15% in the cryosphere. However, these waters have a significant impact on life on Earth and household needs. They also play a major role in climate variability. Water on Earth is continually recycled through precipitation, evaporation and run-off towards the sea. The increasingly accurate characterisation of the water cycle on land surfaces enables more accurate forecasting of the climate and more careful control of global water resources (human consumption and activities such as agriculture, urbanisation and the production of hydroelectric power, for example).\nRadar  echoes  over  land  surfaces  are  hampered  by  interfering  reflections  due to  water,  vegetation and  topography.  As  a  consequence,  waveforms  (e.g.,  the  power  distribution  of  the  radar  echo  within the range window)  may not have the simple  broad peaked shape seen  over ocean surfaces, but can be complex, multi-peaked, preventing from precise determination of the altimetric height.  If  the  surface  is  flat,  problems  may  arise  from  interference  between  the  vegetation  canopy  and water  from  wetlands,  floodplains,  tributaries  and  main  river.  In  other  cases,  elevated  topography sometimes prevents the altimeter to lock on the water surface, leading to less valid data than over flat areas. The time series available in Hydroweb are constructed using Jason-2 and Saral GDRs. The basic data used for rivers are the 20 or 40Hz data(\u201chigh rate\u201d data).To construct river water level time series, we need to define virtual stations corresponding to the intersection  of  the  satellite  track  with  the  river.  For  that  purpose,  we  select  for  each  cycle  a rectangular \u201cwindow\u201d taking into account all available along track high rate altimetry data over the river  area.  The  coordinate  of  the  virtual  station  is  defined  as  the  barycenter  of  the  selected  data within the \u201cwindow\u201d. After rigourous data editing, all available high rate data of a given cycle are geographically averaged.  At least two high rate data are  needed for averaging otherwise no mean height  is  provided.  Scattering  of high  rate data  with  respect  to  the  mean  height  defines  the uncertainty associated with the mean height.The  water  level  and  volume  time  series  is  operationally  updated  less  than  1.5  working  days  after the availability of the input altimetry data, for some virtual stations on rivers. Other virtual stations are monitored on a research mode basis.\n[https://www.theia-land.fr/fr/projets/hydroweb]",
