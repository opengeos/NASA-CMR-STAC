    "description": "This is the Level 2 FIRSTLOOK Aerosol Product. It contains Aerosol optical depth and particle type, with associated atmospheric data produced using ancillary inputs from the previous time period.\nMIL2ASAF_002 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level 2 FIRSTLOOK Aerosol parameters version 2. It contains Aerosol optical depth and particle type, with associated atmospheric data produced using ancillary inputs from the previous time period. Data collection for this product is ongoing.\nMulti-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level 2 Aerosol data products contain various information on the Earth's atmosphere. The aerosol data include tropospheric aerosol optical depth on 17. 6-km centers archived with a compositional model identifier and retrieval residuals, ancillary data including relative humidity, ozone optical depth, stratospheric aerosol optical depth, and retrieval flags. MISR multi-angle imagery will be used to monitor global and regional trends radiatively significant to optical properties (optical depth, single scattering albedo, and size distribution) and amounts (mass loading) of natural and anthropogenic aerosols, including those arising from industrial and volcanic emissions, slash-and-burn agriculture, and desertification. Coupled with MISR's determinations of top-of-atmosphere and surface albedos, these data will measure the global aerosol forcing of the shortwave planetary radiation budget. \nThe MISR instrument consists of nine push-broom cameras that measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four forward, and four aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the exact surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.\nMISR is designed to view Earth with cameras in 9 different directions. As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successfully imaged by all nine cameras in 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the effects of sunlight on Earth and distinguish different types of clouds, particles, and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure.",
