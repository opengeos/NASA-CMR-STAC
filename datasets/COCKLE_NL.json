    "description": "Sustainability in cockle-fishery activities in the Wadden Sea is presently a\ndebate among fishery firms, government and conservationists in The Netherlands.\nBefore 80's the mechanized fishing with dredging exploitation of cockles\noriginally existed in relative harmony with nature conservation in the area.\nThis ended when the over-fishing continued during the series of mild winters in\n1988,1989 and 1990 that resulted into three consecutive years without spatfall\nof cockles (Wolff, 2001). As a result, a dramatic decrease of cockle stock\ncaused unsteady conditions between fishery and natural conservation. Since,\nmechanized over fishing for cockles may harm nature into two main ways: It may\ncause food shortages to birds feeding on large shellfish stock and damage\nimportant habitats like cocklebeds (Scheiffarth, et al 2001). As an outcome,\nthe high mortality of shorebirds was reported because the  species feeds on the\nsizes of cockles that are also preferred by cockle-fisheries (Ens et al., 2003;\nVerhulst et al, 2004; Kamermans,  2002). Then, the policy decision was made to\nensure survival of birds to satisfy at least 60% of their needs at minimum size\nof cockle stock (Wolff, 2001) .  On the other hand, there are studies in the\nDutch Wadden Sea  that show the negative long-term impacts on spatfall of\ncockles because of changes in the sediment characteristics from fine silt to\ncoarse grains done by suction dredging used for cockle fishery purposes (Dare,\net al 2004; Piersma, 2001).  The main request of the Fisheries was that the\nmodel should represent the profit, government, and conservationist interests.\nIn aim of this goal the group applied the Environmental System Analysis (ESA)\nbased on scientific published data in order to develop a model, which would run\nseveral scenarios to figure out the requirements of the stakeholders in the\narea.  \n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE MODEL \n\n 1. Seek the optimum number of boats for cockles\ndredging which will not disturb the cockle stock and the feeding needs of\ncockle-catching bird population. \n\n2. Run the predator-prey model to find out the\nrelationship between cockles and seabirds population. \n\n 3. Test the feedback\nbetween cockles recovery and silt content in the sediment.  Modelling is\navailable per request.",
