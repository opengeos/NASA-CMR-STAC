    "description": "This data set was developed as part of a larger effort by the U.S. Geological\nSurvey to provide plottable locations of aggregate producers for National Atlas\nand for aggregate research.\n\nThis data set contains latitudes, longitudes, and other descriptive data for\naggregate producers in New Mexico that are believed to have been active during\nthe period 1997-1999. The data in this compilation were derived from U.S.\nGeological Survey files, U.S. Bureau of Land Management files, contact with\nproducers, and reports from the New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral\nResources, the New Mexico Bureau of Mine Inspection, and the New Mexico Mining\nand Mineral Division. This dataset includes 2 tables: Table 1 contains crushed\nstone operations and table 2 contains sand and gravel operations.\n\nThis data set consists of one Excel 97 spreadsheet file (NMsandg2.xls) which\ncontains information about Sand Gravel operations in New Mexico and one Excel\n97 spreadsheet file NMcstn1.xls) which contains information about Crushed Stone\noperations in New Mexico.  The files are also included in DIF format under the\nsame filenames, but with the .DIF extension.",
