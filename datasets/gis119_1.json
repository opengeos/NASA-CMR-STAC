    "description": "The Australian Antarctic Data Centre's Mawson Station GIS data were originally mapped from March 1996 aerial photography. Refer to the metadata record 'Mawson Station GIS Dataset'.\nSince then various features have been added to this data as structures have been removed, moved or established. Some of these features have been surveyed. These surveys have metadata records from which the report describing the survey can be downloaded. However, other features have been 'eyed in' as more accurate data were not available. The eyeing in has been done based on advice from Australian Antarctic Division staff and using as a guide sources such as an aerial photograph, an Engineering plan, a map or a sketch. GPS data or measurements using a measuring tape may also have been used.\n\nThe data are included in the data available for download from a Related URL below.\nThe data conform to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See a Related URL below.\nData described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 119.\nEach feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets and quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature.",
