    "description": "A major goal of a research expedition by the Australian Antarctic Division over the summer of (2003/04) in the Southern Ocean off Heard Island was to answer some of the questions needed to determine what level of exploitation of Southern Ocean fisheries is sustainable.  The use of novel equipment, cutting edge technology and some adept logistical co-ordination allowed the Aurora Australis, on the Southern Ocean, to catch the prey of the predators of Heard Island.\n\nThis work was accomplished by placing satellite trackers on animals at Heard Island, and then, using the ARGOS system, monitoring their activities in the Southern Ocean around the island.  The Aurora Australis assisted in the monitoring and tracking of the animals by searching the areas the animals were foraging for prey species.\n\nThe animals tracked in this experiment were:\n\nLight-mantled sooty albatrosses\nblack-browed albatrosses\nking penguins\nmacaroni penguins\nAntarctic fur seals\n\nThe columns in this data file are:\n\nindividual_id - the identifier of the individual animal\nspecies - the species name of that animal\npttid - the identifier of the PTT tracker deployed on that animal\ndeployment_longitude - the longitude at which the tracker was deployed\ndeployment_latitude - the latitude at which the tracker was deployed\nobservation_date - the date (ISO8601 format) of the position observation\nyear, month, day, time, time_zone - as per the observation_date, but in separate columns\nlocationclass - the ARGOS location class of the position (see http://www.argos-system.org/manual/3-location/34_location_classes.htm; value -3 corresponds to a \"Z\" class, value -2 to \"B\", value -1 to \"A\")\nlatitude - the latitude of the position observation\nlongitude - the longitude of the position observation",
