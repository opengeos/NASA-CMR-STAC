    "description": "An aerogeophysical survey of the western Marie Byrd Land region of\n            Antarctica was flown in Dec. 1998-Jan. 1999, measuring surface and\n            base of ice elevation by radar and strength of magnetic and gravity\n            fields.  The coverage area measured about 460 by 360 km, long\n            dimension oriented NE, and included the Shirase Coast of the eastern\n            Ross Ice Shelf, much of the Edward VII Peninsula, the Sulzberger Ice\n            Shelf, and the Ford Ranges.  Track spacing was either 5.3 or 10.6 km\n            over most of the area.  The 60 Mhz radar system usually provided good\n            images of the base of the ice for thicknesses less than 1 km but\n            rarely imaged thicknesses greater than 1.5 km. Determination of\n            gravity anomalies required corrections for acceleration of the\n            aircraft as measured by differential carrier-phase GPS navigation,\n            filtering to remove wavelengths less than 10 km, which are commonly\n            contaminated by aircraft motion, and editing of occasional spikes.\n            The gravity anomalies allow estimation of bed topography under\n            floating ice and under ice too thick for radar imaging.  Magnetic\n            anomaly reduction includes a correction for daily variation as\n            measured at the base camp. Data formats for all observations include\n            files for original flight profiles and grids of edited data at 1.06 km\n            node spacing.",
