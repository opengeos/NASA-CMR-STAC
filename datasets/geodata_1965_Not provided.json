    "description": "Growing stock\n\nVolume over bark of all living trees more than X cm in diameter at breast height. Includes the stem from ground level or stump height up to a top diameter of Y cm, and may also include branches to a minimum diameter of W cm.\n\nExplanatory notes:\n\n1. The countries must indicate the three thresholds (X, Y, W in cm) and the parts of the tree that are not included in the volume. The countries must also indicate whether the reported figures refer to volume above ground or above stump.\n\n2. The diameter is measured at 30 cm above the end of the buttresses if these are higher than 1 meter.\n\n3. Includes windfallen living trees.\n\n4. Excludes: Smaller branches, twigs, foliage, flowers, seeds, and roots. \n\nForest:\n\nLand spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n1. Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters in situ. Areas under reforestation that have not yet reached but are expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 percent and a tree height of 5 m are included, as are temporarily unstocked areas, resulting from human intervention or natural causes, which are expected to regenerate.\n\n2. Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that height and canopy cover criteria are met.\n\n3. Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.\n\n4. Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 ha and width of more than 20 m.\n\n5. Includes plantations primarily used for forestry or protection purposes, such as rubberwood plantations and cork oak stands.\n\n6. Excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, for example in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems. The term also excludes trees in urban parks and gardens. The term is mainly related to FRA 2005 National Reporting Table T1.\n",
