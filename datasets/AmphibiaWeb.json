    "description": "AmphibiaWeb, a site inspired by global amphibian declines, is an\n      online system that allows free access to information on\n      amphibian biology and conservation.\n      \n      AmphibiaWeb offers ready access to taxonomic information for\n      every recognized species of amphibian in the world. Species\n      descriptions, life history information, conservation status,\n      literature references, photos and range maps are available for\n      many species and are being added regularly by specialists and\n      volunteers from around the world. In addition, AmphibiaWeb\n      provides easy and fast access to museum specimen data from large\n      herpetological collections. AmphibiaWeb will encourage a shared\n      vision for the study of amphibian declines and the conservation\n      of remaining amphibians.\n      \n      This site was inspired by the global declines of amphibians, the\n      study of which has been hindered by the lack of\n      multidisciplinary studies and a lack of coordination in\n      monitoring, field studies, and lab studies. AmphibiaWeb will\n      encourage a shared vision for the study of global amphibian\n      declines and the conservation of remaining amphibians. The site\n      already offers ready access to taxonomic information for every\n      recognized species of amphibian in the world.  Species accounts\n      are being added regularly by specialists and volunteers,\n      containing species descriptions, life history information,\n      conservation status, literature references, photos and range\n      maps for many species. Some species have complete accounts;\n      others as yet have only photographs or maps. But all species can\n      be queried for taxonomic, distributional and exact specimen\n      data.\n      \n      AmphibiaWeb currently contains 5,490 species, for which there\n      are approximately 1020 species accounts, 1186 distribution maps,\n      2882 literature references, sound files for 95 frog species, and\n      2813 photos of 942 different amphibian species.\n      \n      Data URL: \"http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/aw/search/index.html\"\n      Information obtained from \"http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/aw/index.html\"",
