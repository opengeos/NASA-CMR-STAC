    "description": "Moraines in the Asgard Range were cored to look for buried soils and other evidence of ice movement at an earlier period in the history of the valley system. A posthole borer was used to drill holes to a depth of 1.5m and samples were collected. If buried soils had been present in this zone they would have been detected. Samples were analysed for weathering.",
