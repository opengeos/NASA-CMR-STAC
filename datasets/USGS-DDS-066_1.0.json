    "description": "To obtain subsurface geologic information about the alluvium in the Big\nThompson River valley, S -wave refraction data were collected along three roads\nthat cross the valley. The traveltimes were processed to estimate velocities\nand thicknesses for a layered-earth model; from these models, three cross\nsections of the river valley were constructed. The river valleys are covered by\na layer of soil, which is 0.2 to 1.5 m thick. Beneath the soil, there is one\nlayer of alluvium at some locations and two layers at other locations. For the\ntwo westernmost cross sections, the total thickness of the alluvium ranges from\nabout 6 to 10 m near the center of the valley and from about 2 to 6 m near the\nsides of the valley. The easternmost cross section is somewhat more complex\nthan the other two, because it is near the confluence of the Big Thompson and\nthe Little Thompson Rivers. In this cross section, the thickness of the\nalluvium ranges from about 8 to 10 m in the southern half of the valley and\nfrom about 3 to 13 m in the northern half. In all three cross sections, the\nalluvium overlies bedrock, which is the upper transition member of the Pierre\nShale.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
