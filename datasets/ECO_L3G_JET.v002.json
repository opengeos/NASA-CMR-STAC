    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52\u00b0 N and 52\u00b0 S latitudes. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Gridded Evapotranspiration Instantaneous and Daytime L3 Global 70 m (ECO_L3G_JET) Version 2 data product provides instantaneous canopy transpiration, leaf surface evaporation, and soil moisture evaporation using the Priestley-Taylor formula. This data product is mosaicked from the L3 tiled JET (ECO_L3T_JET (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L3T_JET.002)) product, projected to a globally snapped 0.0006\u00b0 grid, and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m).\r\nThe ECO_L3G_JET Version 2 data product contains 12 layers distributed in an HDF5 format file including ETdaily, ETinstUncertainty, PTJPLSMinst, STICinst, MOD16inst, BESSinst, STICcanopy, PTJPLSMcanopy, PTJPLSMinterception, PTJPLSMsoil, and cloud and water masks.\r\n",
