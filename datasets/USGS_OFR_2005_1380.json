    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted a survey of water quality and\nquantity in Huron County, Michigan from 1988-1990 (Sweat, 1992). In that study\natrazine, a widely-used agricultural herbicide with possible\nendocrine-disrupting effects was detected in 9 of 9 surface-water samples.\nMetolachlor, metribuzin, prometone, simazine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid\n(2,4-D), and dichlorprop (2,4-DP) were also detected at some surface-water\nsites. One pesticide, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), was detected\nin two monitoring wells. Additionally, routine USGS monitoring through the\nearly 1990's indicated the Pigeon River in Huron County to have some of the\nhighest levels of nitrate-nitrogen and dissolved solids of any monitored river\nin Michigan (Blumer and others, 1992). Recently, new methods of chemical and\nbiological analysis have been developed that allow better evaluation of the\nnature and source of contamination of water. Eleven Huron County townships have\npassed a resolution calling for evaluation of water quality in Huron County. In\n2004 Huron County desired a survey of current water quality in their county. In\ncooperation with Huron County, the USGS collected water samples for analysis of\nmicrobiological, chemical and physical constituents from the Pinnebog and\nPigeon River watersheds in Huron County from April through November, 2004 to\nassess the current state of Huron County's water quality.\n\n\n{Summary provided by the USGS.]",
