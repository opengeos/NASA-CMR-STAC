    "description": "The Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative\n            compiles, processes, and makes available internationally comparable\n            data on institutional developments and investments in agricultural R&D\n            worldwide, and analyzes and reports on these trends in the form of\n            occasional policy digests for research policy formulation and priority\n            setting purposes. The project involves a large amount of original and\n            ongoing survey work focused on developing countries, but also\n            maintains access to relevant data for developed countries produced by\n            the OECD Science and Technology Indicators unit, the U.S. National\n            Science Foundation, and other similar agencies. The activities are led\n            jointly by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)\n            and the International Service for National Agricultural Research\n            (ISNAR), and involve collaborative alliances with a large number of\n            national and regional R&D agencies, as well as international\n            institutions.\n            \n            The ASTI database collects, screens and summarizes agricultural R&D\n            expenditure and related R&D personnel data for both developed and\n            developing countries. Data are mainly collected at institute level and\n            summarized in four institutional categories of implementing agencies:\n            (1) Government; (2) Nonprofit; (3) University; and (4) Business. The\n            first three categories together constitute a \"public sub-total\". R&D\n            activities undertaken by international organizations are explicitly\n            excluded and will be reported separately.\n            \n            The statistical coverage of the four institutional categories varies\n            quite a bit. Government and nonprofit research agencies are usually\n            well covered both in terms of research expenditures and research\n            personnel. The university category is rather problematic as\n            estimations of time spent on research by faculty staff are rather\n            sketchy. Usually a fixed percentage ranging between 10-50% is applied\n            across all faculty staff, for all years. The contribution of PhD\n            students is usually not covered. Research expenditure data by\n            universities are seldom directly obtained and usually estimated\n            indirectly. However, collecting data on research by public and private\n            businesses constitutes the biggest challenge. In most developing\n            countries business R&D surveys are not in place yet, but also in the\n            developed countries ^?agriculture, forestry and fisheries^? businesses\n            tend to be covered quite loosely by business R&D\n            \n            The ASTI database can be queried by country or region, Implementing\n            Agencies, Agricultural R&D Indicators and Years.\n            \n               Data link: http://www.asti.cgiar.org/\n               This information was obtained from the ASTI web site:\n               http://www.asti.cgiar.org",
