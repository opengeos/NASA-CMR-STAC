    "description": "GCOM-C/SGLI L2 Normalized water leaving radiance and aerosol parameters and PAR (250m) dataset is obtained from the SGLI sensor onboard GCOM-C and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GCOM-C is Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent Orbit satellite launched on December 23, 2017, which mounts SGLI and conducts long-term global observations of geophysical variables related to the global climate system across 28 items including aerosol and vegetation over 4 areas of atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere. The data will be used to contribute to higher accuracy of global warming prediction. The SGLI has swath of 1150 km in the visible band and 1400 km in the infrared band. Level 2 products are defined to be products composed of physical quantity data that is calculated based on Level 1B products and meteorological data, as well as various additional data related to the physical quantity data.This dataset includes Normalized water leaving radiance (NWLR), TAUA, and Photosynthetically available radiation (PAR). NWLR data is the upwelling radiance just above the sea surface at 380, 412, 443, 490, 530, 565, and 670 nm, with the sun at the zenith, at the average distance from the earth to the sun (1 AU). It is corrected for the viewing angle dependence and for the effects of the non-isotropic distribution of the in-water light field. The NWLR data can convert into Rrs (Remote Sensing Reflectance) by the parameters of itself. The physical quantity unit is W/m^2/str/um. TAUA (\u00cf\u0084A) data is the aerosol optical thickness at 670 and 865 nm when the atmospheric correction algorithm of ocean color estimated the NWLR data. Note that 'TAUA' and 'AROT_ocean in GCOM-C/SGLI L2 Aerosol over the ocean-land aerosol by near ultra violet (dio:xxxx)' differ in algorithm. The physical quantity is dimensionless. PAR data is the photon flux density which is potentially available to plant for photosynthesis within the visible wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm over ocean. The physical quantity unit is Ein/m^2/day. The product also includes QA_Flag data with the same spatial resolution as the auxiliary data. The provided format is HDF5. The Spatial resolution is 250 m. The projection method is L1B reference coordinates. The generation unit is Scene. The current version of the product is Version 3. The Version 2 is also available, but please note that the \"QA_Flag\" data has been changed.",
