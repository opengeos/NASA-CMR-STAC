    "description": "This data were collected as part of the Ocean Drilling Program.  All data were collected on Leg 119.  The cruise for Leg 119 began at Port Louis Harbor, Mauritius, and finished at the Port of Fremantle, Australia.  The objective was to complete a transect, along with Leg 120, to study the Late Cretaceous to Holocene palaeoclimatic history of East Antarctic, tectonic history of the Kerguelen Plateau, and the late Mesozoic rifting history of the Indian plate from East Antarctica.\n\nSamples are sediments.  Good calibration standards for sediments not available.\n\nMore information can be obtained from the Ocean Drilling Program website.\n\nThe data obtained from the drilling is available on the Ocean Drilling Program website (see Download Paleontology Data).\n\nFrom the abstract of one of the papers:\n\nDuring Leg 119 of the Ocean Drilling Program, between December 1987 and February 1988, six holes were drilled in the Kerguelen Plateau, southern Indian Ocean, and five in Prydz Bay at the mouth of the Amery Ice Shelf, on the East Antarctic continental shelf.  The Prydz Bay holes, reported here, form a transect from the inner shelf to the continental slope, recording a prograding sequence of possible Late Palaeozoic to Eocene to Quaternary glacially dominated sediments.  This extends the known onset of large-scale glaciation of Antarctica back to about 36-40 million years ago, the sedimentary record suggesting that a fully developed East Antarctic Ice Sheet reached the coast at Prydz Bay at this time, and was more extensive than the present sheet.  Subsequent glacial history is complex, with the bulk of sedimentation in the outer shelf taking place close to the grounding line of an extended Amery Ice Shelf.  However, breaks in the record and intervals of no recovery may hide evidence of periods of glacial retreat.",
