    "description": "A sediment sample collected from the coast of Svalbard, Arctic (78\u00b0 55' N, 11\u00b0 53' E). The sediment sample was suspended in 20 % glycerol and preserved at -80\uf0b0C until use. Strain PAMC 20958T was isolated by using standard dilution plating method on ZoBell agar containing 15 g bacto agar, 5 g bacto peptone, 1 g yeast extract, and 0.1 g ferric citrate in 1 L of 0.2-\u03bcm filtered seawater and incubating the plate at 10 \uf0b0C for 12 days. After determination of the optimum growth temperature, strain PAMC 20958T was maintained routinely on Marine agar (MA; BD Difco) or in marine broth (MB; BD Difco) at 20 \u00b0C and preserved as glycerol suspensions (20 % in distilled water, v/v) at -80 \u00b0C. Reference strain H. namhaensis KCTC 32362T was obtained from the KCTC (Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korea) and was maintained routinely on MA at 20 \u00b0C.\r\n\r\nGenome relatedness between PAMC 20958T and H. namhaensis KCTC 32362T was investigated by whole genome sequencing.\n-Analysis of Bacterial Community in coast of Svalbard, Arctic.\r\n-Basic data acquisition of PAMC(Polar and Alpine Microbial Collection).\r\n-Academic report of novel strain.",
