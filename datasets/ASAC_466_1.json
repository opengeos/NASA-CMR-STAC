    "description": "Antarctic Fur Seals from Heard Island fed mainly on fish, but the prey species changed both seasonally and inter-annually.  The majority of prey were pelagic myctophids characteristic of deep oceanic water, and were generally taken in autumn and winter.  The only other fish taken in significant numbers was Champsocephalus gunnari which was mostly taken from late winter through early autumn when it was co-dominant in the diet with the Krefftichthys anderssoni. Males and females foraged in different localities and in different parts of the water column.  Males foraged mainly to the south of Heard Island in winter usually diving deep by day, feeding on scattering layers.  In summer males also fed on the shelf, presumably to the north and east of Heard Island on K. anderssoni at shallow depths primarily at night.  Although diet studies provided little evidence of feeding on crustaceans, diving data indicate that some males may travel to Antarctic waters in winter to feed on krill.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nMonths\nSpecies\nScats\nTime foraging\nNumber of Dives\nTime Submerged (minutes)\nMean Dive Duration (minutes)\nMaximum Depth (metres)",
