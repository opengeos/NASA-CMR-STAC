    "description": "Sixteen digital bathymetric surface models (grids) of the seafloor off the\ncoast of Washington and Oregon were created for wave modeling experiments along\nthe coast of Washington. Surfaces were created for two areas over two time\nperiods. The largest area (covering approximately 46 million km 2) extends\nalong the coast of Oregon and Washington, between Heceta Head OR and Cape\nJohnson WA, from the shoreline to about 2000-m water depth (hereafter referred\nto as the ORWA region). The second area (covering approximately 7 million km 2)\nextends from Tillamook Head OR to Pt. Grenville WA, from the shore to\napproximately 700-m water depth. This area corresponds to the study area\nboundaries of the Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study (Kaminsky et al.,\n1997, Gelfenbaum and Kaminsky, 1998; 1999) and is hereafter referred to as the\nSWWA region. Surfaces defined by the ORWA and SWWA regions were created for two\ntime periods; historical (circa 1926), and modern (a combination of c.1926 and\n1998 as discussed below). Data are presented in both UTM and Washington State\nPlane South coordinate systems, at 500-m and 750-m grid cell spacing, in\nARC/INFO 7.1 (ESRI), SURFER 6.0 (Golden Software), and ASCII formats. The\nvertical datum is mean lower low water (MLLW).\n\nThe data included in this report are intended for scientific research and\nshould not be used for navigational purposes. The use of trade names or\nproducts does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Geological Survey. \n\nThis work was conducted in conjunction with the Southwest Washington Coastal\nErosion Study (SWCES), a cooperative project directed by the U.S. Geological\nSurvey, Coastal and Marine Geology Program and the Washington State Department\nof Ecology. A description of the study and initial results can be found in\nKaminsky et al. (1997) and Gelfenbaum and Kaminsky (1998 and 1999), and online\nat: \"http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/swces/index.htm\".",
