    "description": "The present dataset is part of the report titled Gradinaru S.R., Hersperger A.M., Schmid F. (2021). Deriving Planning Intentions from written planning documents. Report on CONCUR Project- From plans to land change: how strategic spatial planning contributes to the development of urban regions.   The data corresponds to the data collected as part of the DPI Method for deriving all PIs contained in a plan (open coding) as detailed in section 4 of the report. The method involved reading the plans to break down of information in meaningful discrete \u201cincidents\u201d or planning intentions. To identify the planning intentions, the starting points were represented by a) the structuring of the plans in chapters and sub chapters and b) the themes that the plans addressed. Thus, the collected information was not grouped according to pre-defined categories of planning intentions, but rather put together as a list of intentions as revealed by each plan. As a result, we provide, for each case study, a document (named [Urban region name] PI as defined in the plan) which contains:  \uf0d8\tDate when the information was filled in.  \uf0d8\tName of the urban region and analysed strategic spatial plan .  \uf0d8\tA list of all planning intentions contained in a plan, with each PI being addresses as follows:  \uf02d\tName of PI as it appears in the plan  \uf02d\tTranslated name of the PI (i.e. short name for easy understanding of the meaning)  \uf02d\tExplanation regarding the meaning of the PI  \uf02d\tWhy the PI is considered a priority for the urban region  \uf02d\tSpatial information on the PI (text and cartographic representations).  In total, 14 documents are available, one for each case study. Documents contain up to 20 pages of information extracted from the plans together with explanations and notes taken during plan reading.",
