    "description": "The Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) seeks to understand\n            the processes that control the transfer of carbon and other\n            biologically active elements in the ocean.  In addition, JGOFS\n            hopes to improve global-scale predictions of the ocean's response to\n            human-inducded climate change.\n            \n            The North Atlantic Bloom Experiment (NABE) was a multidisciplinary,\n            multinational pilot study of JGOFS, studying the spring phytoplankton\n            bloom in the North Atlantic and its associated biogeochemical\n            processes.  It took place from April until July, 1989, on two cruises\n            of the RV Atlantis II and one cruise of the RV Endeavor.  The stations\n            in the North Atlantic were located from 18N to 72N and from 8W to 47W.\n            \n            As the ship motored between stations, measurements were made along the\n            ship's track.  These measurements include salinity, temperature,\n            fluorescence, and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR).\n            \n            The data is public domain and can be retrieved on-line at\n            \"http://usjgofs.whoi.edu/jg/dir/jgofs/\"\n            \n            [This summary was derived from Oceanus vol. 35 and from the JGOFS WWW\n            pages at WHOI.]",
