    "description": "The RSS SMAP Level 3 Sea Surface Salinity Standard Mapped Image 8-Day Running Mean V6.0 Validated Dataset produced by the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and sponsored by the NASA Ocean Salinity Science Team, is a validated product that provides orbital/swath data on sea surface salinity (SSS) derived from the NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The SMAP satellite was launched on 31 January 2015\r\nwith a near-polar orbit at an inclination of 98 degrees and an altitude of 685 km. It has an ascending node time of 6 pm and is sun-synchronous. With its 1000km swath, SMAP achieves global coverage in approximately 3 days, but has an exact orbit repeat cycle of 8 days. Malfunction of the SMAP scatterometer on 7 July, 2015, has necessitated the use of collocated wind speed, primarily from WindSat, for the surface roughness correction required for the surface salinity retrieval.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe major changes in Version 6.0 from Version 5.0 are: (1) Removal of biases during the first few months of the SMAP mission that are related to the operation of the SMAP radar during that time. (2) Mitigation of biases that depend on the SMAP look angle. (3) Mitigation of salty biases at high Northern latitudes. (4) Revised sun-glint flag.\r\nThe RSS SMAP 8-Day running mean product is based on SSS averages spanning an 8-day moving time window, it includes data for a range of parameters: derived sea surface salinity (SSS) with SSS-uncertainty, rain filtered SMAP sea surface salinity, collocated wind speed, data and ancillary reference surface salinity data from HYCOM. \r\nEach data file is available in netCDF-4 file format with about 7-day latency (after the end of the averaging period).\r\nData begins on April 1,2015 and is ongoing. Observations are global in extent with an approximate spatial resolution of 40KM. Note that while a SSS 40KM variable is also included in the product for most open ocean applications, The standard product of the SMAP Version 6.0 release is the smoothed salinity product with a spatial resolution of approximately 70 km.",
