    "description": "This dataset provides in situ soil measurements including soil dielectric properties, temperature, and moisture profiles, active layer thickness (ALT), and measurements of soil organic matter, bulk density, porosity, texture, and coarse root biomass. Samples were collected from the surface to permafrost table in soil pits at selected sites along the Dalton Highway in Northern Alaska. From North to South, the study sites include Franklin Bluffs, Sagwon, Happy Valley, Ice Cut, and Imnavait Creek. Measurements were made from August 22 to August 26, 2018. The purpose of the field campaign was to characterize the dielectric properties of permafrost active layer soils in support of the NASA Arctic and Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Airborne Campaign.",
