    "description": "Monitoring of sediment and crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) was\nconducted in order to satisfy monitoring requirements set forth in the\nJames River Wauna Mill's National Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)\nPermit (Tetra Tech 1992).  Samples were collected from five sites to\nevaluate the accumulation of dioxins and furans in sediment and\ncrayfish.  Sediment and crayfish sampling primarily focused on\nlocations downriver from the location of the outfall pipe.\n\nSediment samples were collected and analyzed for seventeen\ndioxin/furan congeners, particle size distribution, total solids, and\ntotal organic carbon.  Data are presented on a dry weight basis and\nTOC-normalized values are also provided in the report.  Sampling\nstation latitude and longitude were recorded from geographic\ncoordinates provided by a Trimble Navigation Global Positioning System\nreceiver.\n\nThe area of study was the Lower Columbia River-Wauna.\n\nEach sediment sample consisted of a composite of at least four grab\nsamples.  Surface sediments (top 2 cm) were transferred to a stainless\nsteel bowl and homogenized with a stainless steel spatula.  The\nsamples were placed in jars and stored on ice except for the samples\ndesignated for TOC analysis.  These samples were stored on dry ice.\n\nTarget analytes were Seventeen dioxin and furan congeners.\nConventional analyses included particle size, total solids, and total\norganic carbon (TOC).\n\nAnalytical techniques included Dioxins and furans (EPA Method 1613A),\nTOC (modified EPA Method 415.1), total solids (EPA Method 160.3.),\nparticle size (Puget Sound Estuary Program Protocols).  All results\nare reported on a dry weight basis.\n\nThe information for this metadata was taken from the Columbia River\nBasin: Sediment Database Abstracts.",
