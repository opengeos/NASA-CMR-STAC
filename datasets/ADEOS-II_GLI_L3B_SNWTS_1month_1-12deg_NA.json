    "description": "ADEOS-II/GLI L3 Binned Snow surface temperature (1month,1/12deg) is obtained from the GLI (Global-Imager) sensor onboard ADEOS-II and produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Global environment change has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In order to clarify these environmental changes, the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II, renamed \"Midori II\" after launch) has been developed for the purpose of monitoring the Earth environment using remote sensing technology from space. Midori II carries mission instruments that are particularly dedicated to clarify the water energy cycle and the carbon cycle, and is expected to be utilized for international climate change research programs. GLI an optical sensor that observes the reflected solar radiation from the Earth's surface, including land, oceans and clouds and/or infrared radiation with a multi-channel system for measuring the biological content. The SGLI has a swath of 1600 km.  This product includes snow surface temperature. Snow surface temperature is retrieving the sea surface temperature (SST) for an area consisting of a mixture of snow/ice and melt ponds, and the snow/ice surface temperature (IST) for ocean areas covered by snow/ice. This product is only for the polar regions and for the use with GLI channel 35 and 36. The physical quantity is Kelvin. Level 2 snow impurities, grain size and surface temperature product (SNGI_p) is used as input data. This product includes sum, square sum, max, min of each pixel is included.The provided format is HDF. The spatial resolution is 1/12 degree and the statistical period is 1month, also 16 days statistics is available. Map projection is EQR and PS. The generation unit is Global, North and South Hemisphere. The current version of the product is \"Version 2\".",
