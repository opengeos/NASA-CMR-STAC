    "description": "This project studies the opening of the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica through a combined marine geophysical survey and geochemical study of dredged ocean floor basalts. Dating the passage's opening is key to understanding the formation of the circum-Antarctic current, which plays a major role in worldwide ocean circulation, and whose formation is connected with growth of the Antarctic ice sheet. Dredge samples will undergo various geochemical studies to determine their age and constrain mantle flow beneath the region. Broader impacts include support for graduate education, as well as undergraduate and K12 teacher involvement in a research cruise. The project also involves international collaboration with the UK and is part of IPY Project #77: Plates&Gates, which aims to reconstruct the geologic history of polar ocean basins and gateways for computer simulations of climate change. See http://www.ipy.org/index.php?/ipy/detail/plates_gates/ for more information.",
