    "description": "This database release, USGS Data Series 171, contains data collected during\nfour Japan-USA collaborative cruises that characterize the seafloor around the\nHawaiian Islands. The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology\n(JAMSTEC) sponsored cruises in 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2002, to build a greater\nunderstanding of the deep marine geology around the Hawaiian Islands. During\nthese cruises, scientists surveyed over 600,000 square kilometers of the\nseafloor with a hull-mounted multibeam seafloor-mapping sonar system (SEA BEAM\u00ae\n2112), observed the seafloor and collected samples using robotic and manned\nsubmersible dives, collected dredge and piston-core samples, and performed\nsingle-channel seismic surveys. To date, 32 research papers have been published\ndescribing results from these cruises. For a list of these articles see the\nbibliography.\n\nThis digital database was compiled with ESRI ArcInfo version 7.2.2 and\nArcGIS 9.0. The GIS files contain multibeam bathymetry, and acoustic\nbackscatter data in ESRI grid format, and dive, seafloor sampling, and siesmic\nlocation data in ESRI shapefile format; ArcInfo-compatible GIS software is\ntherefore required to use the files of this database. Metadata for the GIS\nfiles are available as text files. The GIS files were also symbolized and used\nto create Portable Document Format (PDF) files that are ready to be printed.\nAdobe Reader or other software that can translate PDFs is necessary to print\nthese files.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
